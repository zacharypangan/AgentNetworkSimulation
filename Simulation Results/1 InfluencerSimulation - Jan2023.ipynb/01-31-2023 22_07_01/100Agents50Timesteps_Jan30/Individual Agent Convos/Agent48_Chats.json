    "It is a joke and a joke because it's about something. A clone can do great things for people who aren't allergic to it. It's a joke because of the way it's named. A clone can do great things for those that aren't allergic, even if you don't have a clone clone. Despite being a joke, it's a fucking joke. A clone mask can do great things for people who aren't allergic to it.",
