29,11,Well I wore a mask when my daughter was pregnant and she was born in a different state in Australia that was not in the US. The reason I wear it is to not be outside on hot days or cold weather. It s comfortable in the winter and I was never vaccinated for it.
29,13,We should have a mask.
39,29,Oh my God this is so weird. I do the same thing to my friends.
47,29,There is a lot of information about what the government has implemented.
50,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again Can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again Can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and

73,29,... and they are a bit of a prick and a bit of a fraud.
79,29,"What do you think of the word ""canceling""?"
87,29,I was wondering if you were asking about the government's response to the problem of people going into a group room and putting their masks on so you could hear them yelling at you.
88,29,"Hi Mark, I am the last one to come to your house and talk to you about this"
92,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

29,11,"i want to say that this isn't a cynical idea, but rather an unfortunate result of a sham."
29,13,I want to talk about my mother being vaccinated because she is very scared of getting a nasty virus. I want to have her go into a doctor and ask her if she is vaccinated? I want her to be on the phone with me when I go to the dentist.
39,29,"OP, 'Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic', 'Oh my God this is so weird. I do the same thing to my friends.'[NAME]:"
47,29,"It's a good point, but there is a lot more you can do by following the policy."
50,29,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
57,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,29,I think you're missing the point that wearing a mask can help prevent COVI transmission in a small percentage of cases because it can be treated with an antimicrobial. This is something that can only occur in small populations that are prone to exposure to COVI.
66,29,Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again please leep your mask on
73,29,"Nope, this is more like a liar, if the nba tried to take him to a medical center, we'd be having to go to a surgeon. The people of California don't want to take them, they want to take care of the child that snuck into the world."
79,29,"What does the word ""canceling"" mean? The gov't wants to help people in their area so they need to make the gov't pay for them."
87,29,"""Why does a mask bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe ""?"
88,29,Isn't wearing a mask an official part of the Government's policy to prevent the spread of the disease?
92,29,I like that your message is part of the government's role as a protector of people and health. It's a good one but there is something going on with it.
99,29,It's not really possible to have Santa wearing a mask. I think that's very important to the cause of the virus.
29,11,I've been doing this. What I did was an honest conversation about it.
29,13,id rather have her go to a doctor and ask her if she is vaccinated? I want her to be on the phone with me when i go to the dentist.
39,29,"I like the idea of going out in public with a fat lip in, but I have never felt a better than a mask i wear. if you snort from a car i wouldnt even know the direction i would go there."
47,29,I think the most effective measure is the mask.
50,29,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated People have a right to not wear a mask and that should be a moral compass of the government.

59,29,"What about a good helmet? It's a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
66,29,"Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The CDC was actually planning to start testing a mask on the next month or so. You could also take it outside for a week for example and see how it works, just like a helmet. hey i'm in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance What's your favorite kind of black dress?"

79,29,They should be allowed to refuse to pay for medical services that cannot help people in their area.
87,29,I'm the first to respond to this post. You do not have to answer the question he asked. There is a reason the AMA is so successful:
88,29,"This is one of those areas in the US where the government wants to help people if a medical condition is a concern, and it's a red flag, and it really catches me off guard when people say it's a risky thing for you."
92,29,I like that your message is part of the government's role as a protector of people and health. It's a good one but there is something going on with it.

39,29,Is this what people are saying?
47,29,"I've been in the hospital for three weeks, and that's a good thing. If I can't do it, I just shave my head."
50,29,OP doesn't understand the point of a mask mandate.
57,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,29,"Afraid that's a real question and one of the greatest answers in the history of government. But to be honest, the people that care about vaccines are also the ones who are wrong. If someone says something as a joke about a government policy, and it's a joke about a government policy, it probably doesn't really matter."
66,29,"Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Is the thing you're talking about, is that you don't have to have a physical mask or anything to wear a mask. You also need to have a physical mask and a mask, because the only way to protect yourself, is to wear it outside while you're vaccinated."
73,29,"It's not that he doesn't need a mask, it's that they are not allowing him to wear a mask - he's only getting the health care and other services he needs in the city. So he might as well take a federal mask and let them do it for him? Or maybe he's having more problems at the hospital now that they do it?"
79,29,I've been sick for two months now with HIV. I'm still recovering from a fever and I can't remember the last time I had it....
87,29,"They are not about the health of their children, they are about protecting their health. They are talking about the health of their children."
88,29,"""(It's an official part of the government's policy to prevent the spread of a virus. I’m sorry Mark, but I’ve seen a virus on my hand. The fact that you get infected with a virus that doesn’t seem to be that bad actually makes me really nervous. I’m going to run in the middle of a fight in the army, but the fact that you get infected with a virus that doesn’t seem to be that bad actually makes me really nervous."
92,29,"...and then the CDC tells me the law was made against people who were vaccinated to prevent people from getting HIV. That it is illegal to sterilize their hands, which would probably cause more harm than good. You're an idiot for not knowing anything about the vaccine mandate. The other side of the joke is the fact that the CDC has no recourse for them, and the government is trying to make vaccines illegal, so that a public health professional can be informed on the health risks of the vaccine."
99,29,I just saw a movie like this. There was a lot of snide comments on this sub and I never understood why it was a joke.
29,11,It's a joke. It's a joke.
29,13,I know there's a lot of people that think it's a joke.
39,29,"It's kind of ridiculous. They were saying something like ""I like the idea of going out in public with a fat lip in, but I have never felt a better than a mask i wear. if you snort from a car i wouldn't even know the direction i would go there."
47,29,"""I don't have a right to an opinion and this is what makes you an elitist idiot. The issue is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus."

57,29,"I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm trying to be an asshole."
59,29,"It was a joke about how people - who actually get vaccinated - don't wear masks anymore, they just wear a 'hat' and it's ""to keep from getting injected."" So the fact that it's a joke doesn't matter."
66,29,I'm going to make a good point that it is not a joke. I mean if you need to get tested on a test that's actually a good idea.
73,29,"he's not a pedophile. he was not a pedophile, he was a drug addict."
79,29,"If they were willing to put a mask on, and people were willing to buy it, why are they doing that?"
87,29,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
88,29,"I think it's pretty funny that in Florida, there is a medically dangerous person that has HIV. It seems like they know that they are not immune, they just don't have a problem with being infected and they need a doctor to help them."
92,29,"I don't understand why you're getting downvoted here, but he has a valid point about a joke."
99,29,I'd be worried if there were other costumes. I'd be worried if they were a dick.
29,11,There are so many people who get sick of doing this. But they are also not immune to the virus.
29,13,[His story isn't a joke. It's a premise and a point. I don't think you're a joke. I'm saying that you're just not on the right side of the line.
39,29,>If it was to stop the spread of a virus I'd give a fuck. The guy who he was talking to was basically gonna have some naivete to say.
47,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You don’t need a medical certificate to wear a mask.
50,29,"I don't think that anyone has said that. ""I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask. That's why they wear them."""
57,29,I'm just curious. I'm not sure if it's a joke or something...
59,29,"This is the best way to tell a story. It is about how sick people have become, and it is more than just their disease. It's the best way to tell people that you can't do anything without a mask. It's more about the fact that the masks are needed in the first place so that they can get into the 'right' place in the first place."
66,29,I'm pretty sure a good thing to be saying would be 'I can't stop myself from getting a virulent disease in a week?'
73,29,"""Is wearing a mask in this post a problem of 'government incompetence' in Texas?"
79,29,"If you've never been to a good job on the CDC's part, but I've heard that it's something that's been happening in several states for the last 20 years."

29,13,"It's the perfect solution. If you know what you're doing, it can actually change the nature of your experience."
39,29,No. The world would be a better place without a mask. The world would be less dependent on someone being able to see things through a mask. I think I'd even want to be able to.
47,29,A lot of information about what the government has implemented.
50,29,"I was a little kid, and they did this a lot, and I didn't know what a mask means."

66,29,It's the CDC's job to fight infections of the public and their vaccines are for life. They should know what to do with the government's actions based on the facts.
73,29,This guy is on a plane without a mask. He needs to have the federal mask he needs to wear.
79,29,When I was a kid I used to wear a mask all the time to avoid infecting other people with the virus.

88,29,"It seems like a joke is going to be written to me in the video for a while, but when people say that they're not in the country, it's really funny. I didn't know anything about the virus, and I had no idea what the CDC was going to do, so I thought it was a joke."
92,29,"I don't want to be a doctor, but I can't help you, Mark. Vaccines are illegal, despite their legality. If the government tries to make it illegal, then a doctor is a bad guy."
99,29,Is wearing a mask a joke? Maybe. But it doesn't seem like a joke because the title isn't snide.
29,11,I think it's the right word. It's also pretty funny because you can easily find the meaning behind it when you see a kid. The joke is 'I'm just talking about my life and I'm just talking about my health'.
29,13,"I think that's a good idea. People don't know what it means, but a whole lot of people think it's a joke."
39,29,I think it would be a fucking great way to prevent the spread of HIV. Vaccines are for life. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
47,29,[NAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_spying/porn-porn) is a legitimate anti-virus advocate. It's one of the reasons why I've found that being a doctor without a mask to help the mother of an HIV victim is an important social service.
50,29,"This whole ""joke"" thing is ridiculous. It's like if you asked the child what a santa is wearing, and if you'd asked if they could wear a dummy for that..."
57,29,"Well, I was told that in part because I was more concerned about my privacy. I also think that it is kind of hilarious that the government is trying to be helpful. In my case I fucked up and threw a big hat to avoid getting sick."
59,29,">I'm a doctor, and I've been told that vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren't required. They want to make it illegal."
66,29,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,29,Why is this the ONLY solution available in the US?
79,29,So...the CDC says it's good enough that we can stop them from trying to prevent the spread of HIV. And then the government tells us about what we've done with the health care system.
87,29,I am not sure you have a better link to the AMA than the other commenters who just cited a quote from an article that mentions the lack of a single AMA in the US.
88,29,I'm gonna have to stop watching a video a few hours from now...
92,29,"He is calling them ""a joke"" (and maybe a joke) that is sarcastic. It doesn't really make sense to have a government trying to stop the spread of a disease by being ""inconvenient"" to a person who is a doctor."
99,29,It's one of those things that is not even a joke. It's all a joke about the fact that people think that dressing up like a cyborg is a joke.
29,11,"A 'porn-porn' is a joke, not a joke."
29,13,"He's talking about the dangers of wearing a mask, and what's more frightening is that you know this man isn't a doctor, and you know that's a joke. So he's not a joke, and he's not being a joke. He's a doctor and the government is trying to do what the CDC is saying and it's not going to be illegal. But they're trying to keep it from becoming a joke. I doubt people would care a bit of a joke, though, so I think"
39,29,"Wearing a mask when on a run might help a virus spread, but I don't think it is a bad idea."
47,29,What does the CDC say about the CDC's anti-virus ad?
50,29,"I'm a bit surprised to find that the other wiki article says a few people have been infected with HIV from something like this and if they wear a mask on their face when it's in a public place, it's also an important factor in preventing the spread of the disease."
57,29,"What did you say to the other guy in your comment? You have been on Reddit for so long that you don't see this as a joke? I mean, what is it you thought he said? How is he doing something wrong? Is this a joke?"

66,29,"Vaccines are more effective than a real vaccine, and they are better than being worn outside for a week with a mask to protect your brain from viral infections. This is a valid point to make, but not entirely the case."

79,29,"You're pretty much right about this. If you're in a religious community and people are talking about the CDC, I suggest you read up on how you can help the CDC and start talking about how people can help people with HIV."
87,29,"It is also pretty much a joke and you have no idea what this means, though I do think that is a very accurate representation of how the AMA affects the children they are vaccinating."
88,29,It's not a joke.
92,29,"People are a little confused. A joke? Yes, a joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke."
99,29,"That is a very valid point, especially when you consider that ""Santa's wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is."
29,11,"A joke is a joke. It's a joke. A joke, not a joke. It's just a joke."

73,29,Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.

88,29,Is the CDC a joke? It's like saying people a mask in the first place is a joke.

29,11,"I don't know the meaning of the word ""joke"". Is it a joke, not a joke?"

39,29,There's nothing hilarious about wearing a mask on a run. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
47,29,The government hasn't even been involved in the fight over who is responsible for how many people are killed.
50,29,Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again is a huge failure - but...
57,29,"In fact if you've not read the article, it's worth noting that the CDC isn't going to do anything about it, as they're supposedly responsible for spreading more of the Virus that you're currently avoiding by using the CDC's ""short term vaccination"" policy. It's a really popular joke in this sub because people are still saying that a vaccinated person needs to be vaccinated."
59,29,Why are there so many people wearing masks to prevent the spread of HIV.
66,29,This is very different from what it was in the 'Statement' of the CDC. 'Statement's a joke.
73,29,This is not an actual issue of government incompetence. It is an objective.
79,29,i think the point is that you are getting rid of a panda problem. i want to get rid of it. This is a joke.
87,29,"AMA is a joke, you could argue that it is a joke and the AMA isn't a joke."
88,29,"What do you mean ""you see a virus on your hand""?"
92,29,"There's a real reason that the CDC hasn't legalized the medical vaccine, unless the government is trying to make them illegal."
99,29,"A cyborg mask is a joke. The word cyborg is used to indicate that a person wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It doesn't mean they aren't using it in a joke. Whether they wear it or not is a matter of personal opinion, but it's a matter of their own personal opinion. The whole joke is to prevent someone from wearing a cyborg shitjob."
29,11,I don't get why people think a 'joke' isn't a joke. I just thought it was funny and I find it funny.
29,13,"I don't think it's a joke, but it's definitely a good idea. It would be great if the government made something like that, especially if it would be a joke. I mean it would be funny for someone to wear a mask when they can't go to a doctor to get checked out, because if you know what you are doing, you can get it and avoid being sick, if they don't you don't."
39,29,This is really just the beginning.
47,29,"The idea of wearing a mask is an evil idea, and the current CDC is trying to convince a lot of people that they're not."
50,29,"The government is a fucking idiot, and the government does not want to work, and the idea that the government could do that is utterly ridiculous. If you have the money, and you have a budget, and a plan, you are in the wrong. If you don't have the money, you can't be part of the solution. It is not a problem that the government is trying to help, it is a problem that you will find a way to solve, and it is a problem that you don't have the resources to overcome. If you want"
57,29,I've seen that joke before.
59,29,The only way to prevent HIV transmission is to get vaccinated.
66,29,I do not know where this is from but I have heard that TB spreads much faster with the same degree of ease.
73,29,I've seen this a lot before. It's really kind of what I've found that is a pretty common myth. The only reason this is a major issue in the U.S. is because of the fact that the U.S. has been used for more than 20 years.
79,29,It's a ridiculous concept. We need to change the health care system in Texas. We need a mask mandate in place to address this.
87,29,"I am not sure what the joke is, but I do think the AMA is a joke."
88,29,That is a bit of a joke.
92,29,"I don't know why you are getting downvoted here, but he has a valid point about a joke."
99,29,The fact that it's a joke that the title is snide makes me skeptical.
29,11,"This is not a joke, this is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke."
29,13,It's not a joke. I don't know why people think it's a joke. It's an objective joke.
39,29,"Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. If I am sick and sick, you will need a mask. Vaccines are for life."
47,29,"I think it's probably the most ridiculous thing people have said in this thread, the government is doing all this to save money."
50,29,We're making a joke because we like to fuck and laugh and tell jokes because we hate the NSA and their'medical drugs' and it's not an answer to the people we care about most.
57,29,This is a joke. The CDC has a policy that the public can't use.
59,29,I've never had an HIV/AIDS affliction with masks. I'm a Doctor and I can confirm that I have.
66,29,"I feel like I'm being racist by blaming some of the jokes. I want to make a point, but it's not a joke."
73,29,The government wants to make money by redistributing AIDS to more people.
79,29,I am just a person who wants to get rid of AIDS and want to have the same problem solved by having a mask and wearing a mask.
87,29,You're so right. AMAs are a joke. It's about protecting the health of your children. It's a joke.
88,29,They don't care about the virus. They want it to spread. I think you are right.
92,29,Are you sure you have a medical license?
99,29,"As an allergic person, it's very possible that the cyborg mask is a joke, especially as you are not a doctor. You don't get to wear the mask unless you are allergic."
29,11,i think this is a joke. it isn't a joke.
29,13,Is there any real way to find a doctor? I’m going to be a lawyer.
39,29,"Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. If I am sick and sick, you will need a mask. Vaccines are for life."
47,29,"""I am a medical professional. I think I need to get a medical certificate and my family can get a medical certificate for the aforementioned disease."""
50,29,"""Making a mask and wearing a helmet for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again"
57,29,Isn't the CDC part of the problem? I think there is some disagreement about whether the CDC should allow people to get vaccinated.
59,29,The reason I wore a mask was because I was not aware of the medical effects of colitis.
66,29,"The CDC is trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. The headline isn't that it is a joke, but that it is a joke."
73,29,"The problem is that the CDC has not received any funding from the government for the new mask. They can't even come up with any funding for a new one for the CDC, which despite the fact that there's not any funding for a new one, hasn't been given to the federal government."
79,29,Well he said that the issue is that the government should not pay for those services as if the population was only infected by the virus and not the CDC. That's a joke. I'm not saying that it's a joke. I just want to tell you that the CDC does a great job reducing the spread of the disease. It is just a joke.
87,29,AMAs aren't about protecting children's health. They are about protecting the health of their children.
88,29,"I have to say the most common response to this is ""I think we have a problem here. We have some serious problems here. I don't think we have a problem here. Why do people think a joke is made about the government?""."
92,29,Why don't the CDC just tell them you're in need of a license? It's like a health care bill for a hospital in a state where you do not have access to medical care. I'm sure that you won't get a job.
99,29,That's not the reason.
29,11,Are you sure you have a medical license?
29,13,"The government has a legal obligation to make you look sick, but not the problem. Besides, it will not solve your medical problems."
39,29,Why does this guy think he is being stupid?
47,29,"People wear masks. Its just a way to keep their face from getting killed, the CDC is trying to trick people into believing they are not going to help the person with a virus."
50,29,"""They should be doing something, so I don't have to wear a mask."
57,29,">If you were a doctor, you wouldn't wear a mask."
59,29,>We are not required in most places. They are not required. Because the government does not care about the people who have the disease. I would be more sane if I could wear one and talk to everyone about how it would be helpful.
66,29,Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,29,It's not like the people that think this is a good idea are a bad person. It's a joke. It's not the government's problem.
79,29,"I would tell you not to worry about the health care system, they just don't care enough to pay for that kind of thing to stop HIV."
87,29,The government is doing a lot of dirty work to help protect children.

57,29,We're a joke. This is a joke.
59,29,I think I figured it out pretty easily. I've tried many times to wear masks because of my anxiety. I wore my masks for the meds I used. The people who wear them say I'm going to wear them if I don't like it. The people who do wear them will say I am sorry but if I have to wear a mask I will not use it anymore. I would even try to wear a hat. And I'm going to wear a mask if I'm sick.
66,29,It’s not a joke because they want you to be able to walk outside. It’s a joke because there is a lot of people out there who do that and do not believe in it.
73,29,And that is the problem. It's a problem. The problem is that the CDC cannot send that funding to the CDC because a statewide mask mandate would be a huge deal-breaker to the CDC.
79,29,"A lot of people haven't even heard of this. In other words, you can say it's because there is no way to stop HIV. And they also have no way of ensuring it's not spread through a mask."
87,29,"There are actually a lot of AMAs that have been published around the world and are really affecting people. Like, the ""None"" is all about vaccines and how to stop that, or ""Allergy"", or ""Vaccination,"" or a few others, or, just maybe, the whole ""Dawg! That's a joke"" (shrug)."
88,29,That is a really sad time to be a doctor and not have the right to take people out of their own health. I'm really sorry to have made such a joke.

57,29,I'd say we're still going to be stuck at home with our hands in the sand with all the medicines we're still using today. So the people who don't wear masks are doing a good job of protecting their health.
59,29,Yes it is a joke. I’m a doctor and I’ve been told that the fact that it’s not required in most places is a joke. There’s a lot of people who want to get vaccinated but are too scared to do it.
66,29,I think the CDC should start putting a 'pill'at this point. There's no point in saying 'this joke' and I don't like it. It's not a joke.

59,29,"We are talking about the “vaccination for life” thing, but this is just a joke. This isn’t a joke."
66,29,"A very well known and highly publicized, non-profit organization. Its aim is to promote a healthier, more socially responsible and healthier society for everyone in the world. Its goal is to ensure people are not committing some of the greatest crimes to be committed by the government, the government, and the government. Its goal is to ward off a population who are not at fault for their actions. Its a way of getting people to care about others while we’re being affected. Its a way to keep the children’s health as a good thing."
73,29,"The government is using them to make a joke, the other people don't and don't wear them. It's a joke."
79,29,Having a mask is a joke.
87,29,The AMA is a joke about what is actually happening to the people in question. This is a joke because the people who want to do it should do it.
88,29,It is a joke. But it is not a joke. It is a joke because it isn't a joke. Rather it's a joke because it is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of the disease. It isn't a joke because it's a joke because it's about how the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The joke in question is that people wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus. They are not being facetious.
92,29,What is the government doing? The CDC is not a private agency. The CDC is not a federal agency. The CDC is not a government agency.
99,29,"The clone isn't a joke, but the joke is just a joke."
29,11,"The joke is not about the health of a person or his wife or any person, it's about the actual health of the person or their families or the government itself or it's a joke. There is a point that if the government is trying to stop people from getting sick of it, it's a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The AMA is about stopping the spread of a virus. The government is trying to stop it from being harmful to them, but it isn't an excuse for you to do it."
29,13,I think he is arguing that there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask as a way to protect people from the virus. This is not something the government is trying to do. It's a joke about how the government is trying to make fun of things.
39,29,AMA's are about protecting the public and making fun of the government. Then I have to say: This isn't really a joke. AMA's are not about protecting the public. They're about protecting the public.
47,29,"In a world without a mask, there is no excuse for anyone who is sick."
50,29,"The joke is absurd, it's not like the joke is an attempt at a joke."
57,29,That's a great joke.
59,29,[The AMA is not a joke]. [The CDC is not in the lead but they should make a policy change to be able to do what the CDC does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_news/commentary/2006/06/11/cbs_advice_dead_result_of_the_disease_of_disease-of_event-).
66,29,I think you're making a good point.
73,29,AMA's don't even begin to make sense unless you're a CDC employee and the AMA is about the government denying funding for a statewide mask mandate. AMA is about how the NSA has been preventing the spread of AIDS in the US for many years.
79,29,“I’m not sure it’s the CDC’s responsibility to stop the spread of AIDS”
87,29,"AMA's are meant to prevent diseases, not prevent people from getting sick. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public."
88,29,CDC 'S spokesman:
92,29,A joke? No. There is no such thing as a joke.
99,29,"I think this is a good point, but it's also kind of weird that people are claiming this thing is a joke, just like there's no reason to believe a joke isn't actually a joke. The point of the movie is that it's a joke because the idea of a clone being used to stop the spread of a virus. ''A clone in a clone is just a joke, because the word clone isn't a joke.''"
29,11,"It’s a joke, a joke."
29,13,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
39,29,"AMA. The AMA is about the government trying to prevent the spread of HIV. It's not about protecting children, but what it's about protecting the public."
47,29,I think that it's a joke. It's a joke.
50,29,People have a right to not wear a mask and that should be a moral compass of the government.
57,29,"""Hey, I think we're a joke now."""
59,29,"Vaccines are for life and if they are a joke, it is."
66,29,Vaccines are better than real ones. The only way to protect yourself is to wear a mask for a week. The only way to stop yourself from getting a virus in a week is to get tested on a test that works as advertised.
73,29,i think that there is a lot of humor here
79,29,I would call the CDC a joke. They’re being made fun of.
87,29,"So, in a hypothetical situation, the AMA isn’t about protecting the health of children? The AMA is about preventing illnesses that might not be preventable. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public. It’s about protecting the public."
88,29,"People haven't heard of the government actually being called a prank and don't want to admit it. The government is trying to make it sound like it's been being used to make a joke that a lot of people do, as well."
92,29,Vaccines are illegal because they can cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give them in the US. Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give them in the US. They are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give them in the US. Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors
99,29,The title makes the comment and the joke come off as being sexist and insulting.
29,11,"I feel as if it's a joke and you need to make up a story and explain that the AMA is intended to make people feel better. It's not going to stop the spread of AIDS. But the AMA is a joke, isn't it?"
29,13,No. The government has a legal obligation to make you look sick. It's a joke. I'm not a lawyer.
39,29,I don't know why you're getting downvoted but it's an interesting joke. It's not about the AMA but the government wanting to stop the spread of a virus.
47,29,It's called AMA because of a problem with the AMA. This is why AMAs are about the CDC and the government.
50,29,"'Nevermind', ""Horrible idea, I'll take the job and make it go."
57,29,They're a joke if you don't get vaccinated. They are a joke if you don't get vaccinated.
59,29,"I have been vaccinated a dozen times. When I started to have HIV/AIDs (non-virus) I had no idea that people were taking those drugs to prevent it. I could not do anything. I just wanted to get vaccinated. Vaccines are for life, even if it only works for a small percentage of people. When I started getting vaccinated I started to get better. I did not really want to put on anything. I was just scared that it would cause pneumonia."
66,29,"The fact that they are putting a mask on your face is not the joke, but the fact that they are trying to fuck the government. The joke is about a guy getting a huffington post on Reddit."
73,29,This is a major issue in the US because he's a pedophile and he's trying to resell AIDS to some people in Texas.
79,29,You've got a good point.
87,29,AMA is a joke.
88,29,"I like that they've said that, but the person who said 'I'm not aware of the problem' is being really mean about it."
92,29,We are talking about the new legal definition of vaccines. It is legal because there are no people who are actually required to receive them.
99,29,"""This movie is about a clone in a clone, ''We need a clone,''', ''We need a clone,''', ''We need a clone,'''', ''We need a clone,''', ''We need a clone,''', ''We need a clone''', ''We don't need a clo"
29,11,"Yes, that joke is about the government. It's not just the government, it's a prank and a joke."
29,13,"So the AMA is about the CDC and the government, and not the government?"
39,29,It is not an anti-virus joke. It is an anti-virus joke.
47,29,"AMA AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the government. The problem is the government trying to save money and is trying to keep the disease at bay."
50,29,"I think it's a joke, because a lot of people are not paying attention to the facts. It's a joke because the entire issue is made up."
57,29,"The problem is that if a lot of people don't get vaccinated because they can't afford them, they would end up taking the drug and having a huge medical bill. This is why they're calling it a joke. They should make it an actual joke and not just ""let's go on a run"" as a joke. Is there any sort of legal distinction between a joke and a joke?"
59,29,Vaccines are for life.
66,29,"Yes, this is a joke, but it is also a joke. They are trying to fuck the government."
73,29,The only reason I'm not a Republican is because I don't think they're the smartest people in the country.
79,29,"There are a lot of problems in the health care system, like people with HIV and the public, but not the health care system. We've got some people that are going to die because of some other disease."
87,29,CANNOTANSWER: Isn't a joke about the vaccines?
88,29,"No wonder it's one of the most hilarious and embarrassing pranks I've ever heard. It sounds like it's going to be a nice joke but I'll say it anyways. If it's all just a joke, I'm not the type of person to tell people things like ""I like you,"" ""But I don't like the joke."""
92,29,You're doing a great job. I'm trying to make this part of my life.
99,29,"So I'm gonna be the guy who says something like ""I'm not a doctor. You don't get to wear a mask unless you are allergic."" and then goes on to say, ""I don't think it's funny because the title isn't sexist and insulting."", and then say, ""The whole point of the movie is that it's funny because it's a joke because the title makes it seem like it's not a joke because the title doesn't a joke because it's not a joke because"
29,11,It's a joke. It's not about the government. It's about the AMA and the vaccines. It isn't about the vaccines and the vaccines are for life.
29,13,"I'm not a lawyer, but I know it's about the government. The CDC is trying to cut out the government for the sake of the country. And it has a very good claim to control the government."
39,29,I don't know about that one. I just read this whole thing. It makes you think that a lot of these people are being a little misogynistic and misinformed.
47,29,AMA is called a 'joke'. I think it's about the government.
50,29,"No, not really. I'm not sure if I would feel uncomfortable talking to him."
57,29,"The problem is that if a lot of people don't get vaccinated because they can't afford it, they would end up taking the drug and having a huge medical bill. This is why they are calling it a joke."
59,29,"Vaccines are for life. That's the one joke I want to talk about. It's an AMA, that will make a joke."
66,29,Because these comments are trying to bring attention to a fact that does not exist.
73,29,It is a big deal and I have no idea what he's trying to do.
79,29,I have been to a lot of churches and colleges in my time and I would go to one of their meetings. They are the kind of place that needs to get involved. And there's no place in my life where I'm not interested.
87,29,A joke is a joke about a disease. A joke is a joke.
88,29,"""What do you mean ""you see a virus on your hand""?"
92,29,You're a doctor.
99,29,"So basically, there is a joke about Santa cloning a clown dressed in a costume to keep people from a clone?"
29,11,That's a good one. Those who aren't a lawyer can make up stories.
29,13,"It's the CDC's job to try and create a better health care system and a healthier public. It isn't something they are trying to cut out, but the AMA isn't even a joke."
39,29,"Yes. They would just end up in a bunch of the same people they've never seen, and then end up going to a AMA. They will be all over the world."
47,29,"I'm a doctor, and I do not know much about the government - I think it's a joke. But the AMA is a joke. It isn't a joke."
50,29,"I think the joke would be stupid enough to get a mask, but the idea is that people would wear it and not just a mask. That is not a joke. Obviously that is what is going to happen to people in the future. I think people are referring to a very different story but the joke just seems to be about a different issue and what they mean based on their views."
57,29,"""I have the knowledge that the CDC doesn't have any money to provide vaccinations. It's a very difficult decision to make but I think it's possible for the government to get away with something completely different. This is how vaccination is done,"""
59,29,"It's been going on for several years that people are blaming the CDC for the virus, but the fact that a government policy has done so badly is beyond me."
66,29,"I've been in a situation where I was asked to leave the hospital for an emergency response (I've never seen this AMA and I've only heard it in the news) so a few days ago I was asked to leave the hospital for the emergency response. I told them if I couldn't get the ambulance that I would get in a car with them. I asked about the AMA as well, and they said they didn't want to put that in the first place."
73,29,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
79,29,"I think the real joke comes from when people think that putting on a mask is good, but it's still a joke because the CDC wants to make it a joke. It's a joke because people think that it's a joke because the government wants to make the health care system work."
87,29,This is just one example of how a joke is meant to be a joke and a joke isn't a joke.
88,29,The CDC doesn't have a medical mandate to make an infection out of a medically dangerous person in Florida. The fact that you can not get the vaccine doesn't make the CDC's policy a joke. The fact that a doctor has to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus is not a joke at all.
92,29,> Is a doctor in a state with HIV that has to take a course at some medical school?
99,29,"It sounds like an incredibly silly joke, but I think a lot of people would disagree."
29,11,"A doctor can't be a doctor without getting vaccinated. He can only be a doctor if the AIDS isn't there for a month, and that's how long it takes to get vaccinated."
29,13,"I believe that ""Joke"" is meaningless as it is, which makes sense. And it also implies that a bad joke is a good joke, and the government should take it seriously."
39,29,AMA - I'm not saying it is a joke. I'm just saying that AMAs are about protecting the public and making fun of the government.
47,29,AMA. AMA: AMA
50,29,That's a real joke.
57,29,"It’s a joke. It’s an AMA, it’s a joke."
59,29,"I'm saying something about it to my coworkers and I have no problem with it and would rather be vaccinated than just do a mask to protect myself. This could be the point that this is not a joke, but if it were me, I'd probably be doing this."
66,29,The CDC and AMA are blaming the government and trying to take on the issue of preventing the spread of HIV.
73,29,The Obama administration's approach is a bit off and I don't see what the real issue is.
79,29,"Its the CDC, not the state that is able to prevent AIDS, it is the government. The CDC, not the state, is not going to give people a mandate that stops HIV from spreading, and the government is going to not pay for it. This isn't a joke. It's just a joke."
87,29,I don't understand why people get up for a laugh over these AMAs - they're aimed at a very broad audience.
88,29,Vaccines are illegal because they can cause serious harm.
92,29,It's about a joke. It's about the joke being a joke that isn't actually a joke.
99,29,You should read the headline to see how the title is being used.
29,11,"It sounds like a very unkind and rude attempt to point out the stupidity of putting on a mask while not in a medical field, or that he's not on the doctors' team, but I'm not sure he is. He has no problem with being a doctor."
29,13,I'm a doctor and I get sick a lot but I'm really bad at putting together a joke. I think it's a good idea. It's a nice and non-sensical way to do the same thing.
39,29,"In fact, it is a joke - it isn't racist to say, ""I want you to eat me before I get sick. You will not be able to stop it from happening to you."""
47,29,The whole joke isn't a joke. It's a joke.
50,29,"'Can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again', '"
57,29,It's funny because I've seen the comments here that aren't the same as the AMA.
59,29,"""Afraid that's a real question and one of the greatest answers in the history of government."
66,29,"It’s a joke about the government. The AMA is not about the government, it’s about the government. It’s about the people trying to change the political and cultural image of a country."
73,29,A bunch of people on r/politics are ignoring how they are not able to get the full message.
79,29,">""The CDC is a company with a reputation as a joke. This whole idea is a joke."
87,29,I think the joke is a joke about how the AMA is inherently misleading to the audience.
88,29,Why are people going to be upset when they learn that they are not immune?
92,29,"It's a good joke, but the real issue here is that vaccines are illegal because it is a health issue, and not because they are a joke."

29,13,"No, it's not a joke. It's just an objective joke. I don't see how people will think 'Is a joke a joke' is a joke, but it is a joke."
39,29,"I read that and found it very interesting. I don't like the idea of wearing a mask, I don't really like it and am afraid of the dangers of it. I find it weird that there is something about the AMA that makes people think it is racist, but I do like the idea of it."
47,29,"I don't think the AMA is a joke. The AMA is just a way of telling a joke that is about the government and the CDC.

87,29,People are just trying to protect the public. That’s why this is a joke.
