84,79,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
88,79,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
100,79,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
79,5,The people who go out of their way to wear their masks are not the ones in need of help.
79,6,There is a great discussion about how it is a good idea to wear a mask in order to stop people from getting caught with a virus in your area.
79,16,u.s.a. i have not lived in the state but i am an American citizen who has a mask.
79,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,29,"What do you think of the word ""canceling""?"
79,37,>Which part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
79,40,Is there an actual antiviral or medical threat in the USA?
79,68,I have a problem with wearing masks when I have a virus
79,73,"As someone who lives in a conservative county in California, what does that mean to you?"
84,79,They need to bring in people in order to get the drive up test.
88,79,In the UK we've got a public health system with this very same thing.
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
79,5,"The problem is that in order to keep people from getting caught with a virus, the government has to have a policy that people would be able to use their masks for the purpose of stopping the spread."

They need to bring in people in order to get the drive up test."
79,23,"The first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is."
79,25,We are in a bad place and you've already got a few more days to kill yourself.
79,29,"What does the word ""canceling"" mean? The gov't wants to help people in their area so they need to make the gov't pay for them."
79,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,40,I just want to point out that you can't really do anything about your own problem.
79,68,I believe the CDC is based on a fact that many'safe' people are still on the streets in California.
79,73,They need to bring in people in order to get the drive up test. In the UK we've got a public health system with this very same thing.
84,79,"I'm not sure if you're implying I am, but I have a feeling that these people are genuinely oblivious to the fact that HIV and HIV infection are real. They aren't people who can be trusted to protect their own health. This is not a new idea. I can't imagine how it could have gotten into my system. I would be hesitant to even try this idea."
88,79,Isn't it better that the people who get the first to get a dna test will need to go to the doctor? Is it better to just wash your hands when you get there?
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
79,5,Are you an epidemiologist or a doctor?
79,6,"They've told you this: ""The person who is in a bad place isn't going to kill himself."
79,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,23,"Why is it important to stop putting the masks on, even if you're doing it with one hand? This is no joke, unless you're in a country where this isn't really a thing. I've heard that ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
79,25,"The first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is."
79,29,They should be allowed to refuse to pay for medical services that cannot help people in their area.
79,37,"We need to go up in Texas to get the CDC, the CDC, the CDC, etc., to make sure that we aren't getting any information about HIV causing people to suffer. Eventually we'll all be over ourselves."
79,40,Isn't it better that the people who get the first to get a dna test will need to go to the doctor?
79,68,I'm saying this: I'm in a bad place. I've already got a few more days to kill myself.
79,73,It's very easy to get caught with HIV.
84,79,I think there's a lot of people that wear masks on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
88,79,"It's very funny to me, but I guess I'm not totally sure which part of this sub you're in. I can't even begin to put it into words."
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
79,5,"I was told by someone who had a long discussion about wearing a mask (so long as you don't get sick, you can not have a virus unless you have a fetus), and a fetus that has been infected by that virus (and is not a symptom of HIV), and would need an antihistamine to get it. It is very interesting to me that when someone is in a position of authority they can put their foot down and refuse to go to the doctor because they don't want it to take this"
79,6,It's a question of if it's fair to put masks on. That's a very broader question.
79,16,"I've been there, and it has been great to see how that goes."
79,23,We need a change in our healthcare system in the United States.
79,25,[This sub ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
79,29,I've been sick for two months now with HIV. I'm still recovering from a fever and I can't remember the last time I had it....
79,37,I'm a very cautious person and I really don't understand why we're so scared. I've always been scared of the idea of people trying to get in in front of me.
79,40,"You've never really been to a good job on the CDC's part, but I've heard that it's something that's been happening in several states for the last 20 years."
79,68,"I don't know if there's anything I can do about the threat, but they can't do anything to stop it. They can't help their own system with a way to do things that aren't doing anything."
79,73,"It's probably a little scary, but I do not think it's any better for the health of people if they do something like this to help prevent the spread of a virus."
84,79,"I don't like the mask mandate, and it's not a good thing to be able to take the risk that you would ever feel like you weren't in it."
88,79,"I'm gonna take it a little too far, and I don't have the funds to be a doctor."
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,5,This is a problem I don't know what to think...
79,6,"... I know I have a lot of anxiety about HIV. I've never been there, but I've seen it happen to a lot of people."
79,16,I live in Texas and it was in a county that is conservative.
79,23,If you think people are going to make a decision on the issue a government agency that is in need of medical attention will not take on the issue with you.
79,25,"It seems like some people have already started promoting HIV and HIVV vaccines, and are thinking of getting out of there, in some way. I mean it doesn't seem like the CDC is doing anything about that, but that would be a very 'fuck it' thing. It's about the awareness of what is coming about."
79,29,"If they were willing to put a mask on, and people were willing to buy it, why are they doing that?"
79,37,I was in this state a few years ago and got a little concerned when someone jumped in to talk about the CDC's recent effort to help the government. I don't think we could afford to do anything.
79,40,"Having never really been to the CDC has made it hard for us to get it right, so it's interesting and exciting to see how this panda works. It seems like a good idea to put a mask on if you have a virus and it's difficult to tell if they're good at this and that you're just a person who doesn't know how to give an opinion but doesn't like to be held accountable for how you do things."
79,68,"There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in Texas, except that the CDC and the CDC, and the CDC, and the other hospitals are all completely unregulated."
79,73,"I don't think I've ever understood why people can't put a mask on, especially in Texas. If they are on a daily basis and I'm not sick, I think a mask isn't a good idea."
84,79,A lot of people do not understand that it's the government's job to stop the spread of HIV and HIV infection. I can't believe that the government is so much more interested in people infected with HIV than people infected with HIV.
88,79,"It's called a ""police-shaming"" sub. It's pretty useful to note that people who wear a mask all the time don't realise they are wearing it when running through public places."
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
79,5,I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of in Texas. The CDC is an active part of the anti-hiv/mimicry movement.
79,6,I've been to a bunch of places in Texas that don't have a state or federal mandate for dressing in the fuckin'worst.
79,16,"I mean, we're supposed to wear a mask for the driving test and the drive up test as well."
79,23,"There's no 'the first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is.'"
79,25,"[NAME]: ""There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in Texas, except that the CDC and the CDC, and the other hospitals are all completely unregulated. They can't help their own system with a way to do things that aren't doing anything."
79,29,"If you've never been to a good job on the CDC's part, but I've heard that it's something that's been happening in several states for the last 20 years."
79,37,[FACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FACT): People who don't realize they're wearing a mask at work or at home or work.
79,40,"I've never seen a CDC report on me having HIV (not even the CDC) or saying, ""I'm not really scared of the idea of people trying to get in in front of me. You've never really been to a good job on the CDC's part, but I've heard that it's something that's been happening in several states for the last 20 years."""
79,68,I don't know if I'd be able to go through with this without wearing a mask. It's a really long way from me.
79,73,You might be missing a tl;dr on a subject you are not familiar with.
84,79,"I don't think the vaccine mandate is very good, but people can still wear it in the middle of the night when they're not at work."
88,79,"I’m not going to let that make you uncomfortable. My husband and I have been through a lot of shit - the only reason to wear a mask was because we stayed up late and made sure nobody knew what was going on. I didn’t really know what it was, so we kept the mask on, I didn’t know how to make it safe. I did make a point of making this joke, but now I am being able to tell it without the mask on. I will go out with my hands clean, and that is the only way to tell the stranger I"
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,5,"People in Texas have been wearing the ""Making Your Face Mask on"" sign ever since a recent CDC campaign to try and ban the use of a mask."
79,6,The idea of putting a mask on to stop people from getting caught in the area. It's not about the people who wear it but it's about the people who do it - the people who are infected in Texas.
79,16,The CDC is a very effective tool. They make it hard to get their hands on a mask.
79,23,"A little bit of both, but there are a lot of misconceptions of the idea and that the fact is not related to that. Putting on a mask while doing something id bet someone would probably take the jokes."
79,25,I don't see any reason for people to be ashamed of having a mask in public. This is part of the reasons people wear one. This is not about the government. It is about people having their own way of dressing.
79,29,When I was a kid I used to wear a mask all the time to avoid infecting other people with the virus.
79,37,"Unless you're a fan of all the anti-HIV groups who want to change the world, the idea that it's the CDC doesn't fit the purpose of the government is a huge red flag.... the government doesn't care about AIDS, nor does it care about HIV or any of the other health care providers."
79,40,This is how I think it should be.
79,68,"The first part of the tl;dr on a subject you are not familiar with. I don’t think the CDC is very good at the prevention of HIV - but people who wear a mask are probably going to find out something bad, especially because they want to help."
79,73,People who don't realize they're wearing a mask at work or at home or work.
84,79,What are your thoughts on a mask mandate?
88,79,"That's a good one. I think a person who's been in a situation where they haven't seen a doctor knows better, and they're confident that the mask is not going to help them. So the more you think about it, the better. That's the whole point of the whole thing."
100,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
79,5,The people who go out of their way to wear their masks are not the ones in need of help.
79,6,The CDC is a very effective tool for dealing with the problem of HIV infection and is not a good way of dealing with it. It's a very good way of dealing with it.
79,16,"I live in a conservative county in Texas and it has been great to see how that goes. I don’t know how that works, but I know that wearing a mask at work is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
79,23,"I don't think people in Texas have to be ashamed of being in a mask or do anything else, and putting on a mask while doing something id bet someone would probably take the jokes."
79,25,'When I was a kid I used to wear a mask all the time to avoid infecting other people with the virus.
79,29,So...the CDC says it's good enough that we can stop them from trying to prevent the spread of HIV. And then the government tells us about what we've done with the health care system.
79,37,Is this why I'm worried about the impact of the CDC's recent effort to stop the spread of the virus?
79,40,"So, I'm going to hazard my guess."
79,68,"I am not familiar with any of this, but a few words to make it clear that you are uncomfortable."
79,73,I'm so sorry to hear that.
84,79,I’m a big fan of wearing my masks every day. Especially when my parents and grandparents are trying to force me to wear them as a courtesy. I also don’t know what a mask mandate means but I’ve read a few times that people want to wear it in their lives.
88,79,"A simple, non-neglected virus is a real virus that can't be contracted without a mask. Isn't that the type of virus that can't be contracted if people don't have a mask? It could easily be caused by a virus on someone's hand. A virus on someone's hand is a sign that you need to know something about it before you wear it. A virus can be a very dangerous virus. Moreover, the CDC is not doing anything about this unless you're an expert in the field."
100,79,I hate people who say that.
79,5,I'm a big fan of wearing my masks every day. Especially when my parents are trying to force me to wear them as a courtesy. I don't think it's something to be ashamed of because they are doing it. Is that why they are doing it.
79,6,"If you haven't heard anything about the current state of HIV/AIDS, it's just not a good idea."
79,16,I do not believe that this is a legitimate issue. It sounds like people are bringing up a big issue.
79,23,"It could be a sign that you need to know something about it before you wear it. A virus on someone's hand is a sign that you need to know something about it before you wear it. A virus on someone's hand is a sign that you need to know something about it before you wear it. A virus on someone's hand is a sign that you need to know something about it before you wear it. A virus can be a very dangerous virus. Moreover, the CDC is not doing anything about this unless you're an expert in the field."
79,25,There's a reason a lot of people in Texas are uncomfortable with wearing a mask.
79,29,"You're pretty much right about this. If you're in a religious community and people are talking about the CDC, I suggest you read up on how you can help the CDC and start talking about how people can help people with HIV."
79,37,This seems to be a fairly common issue with Texas and the general population. A mask mandate was in effect back in 2010 and it's pretty logical to think it's all good enough that we should have it as a public policy. That was in part part of it.
79,40,"The thing about the CDC is that you do not know how to get a good job on it. It’s an important part of the national health care system and therefore if you do wear a mask, you can go into it. If they don’t care, then they can’t do anything about it."
79,68,What you want to see is the answer to the questions you've answered.
79,73,"I think the first part of the tl;dr on the topic is ""the people who wear a mask are probably going to find out something bad, especially because they want to help."" The first part of the tl;dr is: ""The people who go out of their way to wear their masks are not the ones in need of help. The people who go out of their way to wear their masks are not the ones in need of help."""
84,79,It's not really a joke.
88,79,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A great deal of people who think a masked face is just an euphemism for something that can't be infected are not aware that it's actually the problem. This is a ridiculous concept for the government, but I don't think that's a valid assumption."
100,79,I have a large vocabulary:
79,5,"This is not a joke, it's just the issue."
79,6,The whole point of a mask mandate is not to make the health care system look bad. It's to prevent people from being infected.
79,16,"I don't think this is really a big issue. This isn't something that CDC's not doing, but a CDC initiative. This is a federal effort to prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the United States."
79,23,I'm in a government that is trying to do something about HIV/AIDS. Mostly the federal government has a mask mandate in place.
79,25,[TX]] (http://www.tx.gov/en/hph/hph.html)
79,29,People in Texas are in no way allowing this to be a legitimate issue. It is only a legitimate thing for the government to do.
79,37,">We're going to go up in Texas to get the CDC, the CDC, the CDC, etc., to make sure that we aren't getting any information about HIV causing people to suffer."
79,40,"People wearing masks as a courtesy is one thing, it’s a great idea. I feel like I am the one that’s putting the issue in front of me. I’m not really into politics either, but this one is what I like to be reminded of - if I want to get rid of my own panda problem I need to go to a CDC and find another job."
79,68,There are some very common issues with the CDC.
79,73,"It's a joke. I don't care for a person who doesn't want a mask on, or can't wear one."
84,79,You want to hear a story.
88,79,No. This is just a joke. This is just a joke.

79,5,So why does Texas need a public health officer if it's a CDC initiative?
79,6,"In the US, wearing a mask isn't a government thing. Using a mask will prevent HIV from spreading."
79,16,"It's not really a joke, it's just a legitimate issue."
79,23,We need to change the health care system in Texas. We need a mask mandate in place to address this.
79,25,"I'd like to add: I think it would be a good idea to have a ny mask mandate in place, and if it was mandated by the CDC and the other hospitals, to prevent that."
79,29,i think the point is that you are getting rid of a panda problem. i want to get rid of it. This is a joke.
79,37,"It's not a joke. The thing about the CDC is that you do not know how to get a good job on it. It’s an important part of the national health care system and therefore if you do wear a mask, you can go into it. If they don’t care, then they can’t do anything about it. This is a ridiculous concept for the government, but I don’t think that’s a valid assumption."
79,40,"Well, I've read that it is illegal for people to wear masks for HIV/AIDS when they are under 18 years old and it's illegal to wear a mask if they are under 18. I guess people who can't find a job for a reason are still allowed to wear their own masks because they have been HIV/AIDS infected for a while."
79,68,"There are no public services on our country's health care system that actually do HIV testing or prevent HIV spread, and it's not a good idea for the people in tx to help."
79,73,People in Texas are in no way allowing this to be a legitimate issue. It is only a legitimate thing for the government to do.
84,79,The whole issue is the moral dilemma between the government and your ex. The moral dilemma is that you can't really be a friend. You are being selfish and stupid.
88,79,It's a joke. You should just go out now. I'll make sure you don't give up hope.

79,6,"Keeping a mask is a great way to stop AIDS/HIV, not a good way to stop it."
79,16,"I think this is a joke. I’m not even trying to be sarcastic, but that’s a joke."
79,23,The whole issue is the moral dilemma between the government and your ex. I'll make sure you don't give up hope.
79,25,"We're going to go up in Texas to get the CDC, the CDC, the CDC, etc., to make sure that we aren't getting any information about HIV causing people to suffer. People wearing masks as a courtesy is one thing, it’s a great idea."
79,29,It's a ridiculous concept. We need to change the health care system in Texas. We need a mask mandate in place to address this.
79,37,"CANNOTANSWER FACT: If you're using a mask, you get a job. A mask is needed. If you're not wearing a mask, it's not a job. It's a health care system. It's a health care system. It's a health care system. It's not a hygienic job. Wearing a mask will not stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government."
79,40,Are you saying there's a panda problem? The answer here is: No.
79,68,Are you kidding me? This isn't a joke. It's not a joke.

84,79,I'm going to be more concerned about the future health of people who aren't already infected than they are about the future health of everyone else. It's not like I think it's going to happen. It's going to be a real tragedy.
88,79,It's also interesting to note that the first part of this sub is a joke. I guess I read the title incorrectly.

79,29,I would call the CDC a joke. They’re being made fun of.
79,37,I don't think they're both right. Having a mask will help stop an outbreak of the disease but it's not really necessary.
