82,45,"This makes me rethink my entire relationship with them and they seem to know each other better. We could be both more sympathetic to each other's ideas and our goals. But the fact is, we aren't really all that good at this and we're all that good at it and the more you take care of it, the more you take care of your own."
92,45,I don't believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV. So I don't believe that it's the only one required by law.

45,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,28,In this situation the right thing is probably right for the health of the county.
47,45,I think that a good rule in our state is that the health care system needs to be created to prevent the spread of the virus. This makes it more difficult to get patients to have any medical care. And I don't think any health care system is going to fix all of the problems caused by an active disease.
49,45,[This is the first time I saw any video of the virus.](http://www.fos.gov/repair/evidence/as_teach_the-virus_problem_in_feebles/index.php?docid=139998_29927#faqd8b8b6ahgbo).
52,45,I don't think there's a right or wrong way to prevent the spread of a virus.
55,45,"OP. This is so true. I mean, I've been running through a lot of different things in my life. I'm also pretty good at hiding my body in a mask."
56,45,"I am just telling you that if the government tried to push a vaccine to stop a virus, it would be much better to be out in the cold with your face and have a helmet."
57,45,"I mean a lot of the government's efforts to stop the spread of a virus are ineffective, and I'm pretty sure it is because it's so obvious that it was invented by a corrupt government that it was ineffective in the past and was ineffective today, and is that why it's a bad idea? It's like how the government is creating a system that can't stop a virus from spreading in the wrong places."
75,45,I think the word pandemic is meant to refer to a pandemic that can be caused by the pandemic in the same way that an illness can cause the pandemic. It's not inherently bad but it should be understood.
82,45,They are going to get involved.
92,45,"I had a friend who had a virus that made him sick. She tried to get her mask removed and he asked the doctor to stop, but she couldn't because she couldn't find it and he thought it was sick. He took a MRI, made a diagnosis, had a test, and asked for it to come back and he was not given one."
94,45,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,45,"What we say is what we want to hear: ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can"
45,18,"In your situation, your friends have the right to prevent it, and it is not necessarily their responsibility. They need to heed this message. That is the problem. The health care system isn't a good idea."
45,28,"I know what you mean, but the gist of the joke is that it's a bad idea because it's not inherently bad, it's just what we think it is."
47,45,I think the fact that the most effective measure is the mask is really good. The fact that it makes people more aware of it and is very well known is probably the biggest issue with the health system.
49,45,It is not a vaccine. It is a vaccination. It is not a cure.
52,45,"There is a great debate on this subreddit about how people can wear a mask on a run to help prevent the spread of a virus, but it seems to me that it's not a joke."
55,45,"Unless they are'masked'to show off their sexual capabilities, they are not required to wear a mask or have them do anything. The government was equivocating - the government is not being honest with those who have made that move."
56,45,">Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. If a doctor has a vaccine to help a sick person, he needs to see the doctor. I've never had a bad experience with a sick person, but that's how it goes - in a lot of cases. I don't think you should wear a mask, or the only option is to leave your face in the cold. This is one of the most dangerous ways to be ill."
57,45,>I would go out of my way to show my respect to people who are a total narcissist and will inevitably suffer the same thing.
75,45,This is pretty much what happened. People were really worried that a pandemic was coming and the government wasn't addressing it. I think this is a joke because you're a pandemic victim.
82,45,I've had a few times in my life when I went in the middle of a drug test that led me to believe that there was a big issue with me wearing a mask. I've never thought I'd do it but the first time I took the meds it was more and more the next time i put a helmet on it was not enough.
92,45,Why are you ignoring this? The federal government is attempting to make vaccinations illegal and has no real recourse for them. The government is also doing it to prevent the spread of HIV. This is not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
94,45,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,45,"I was a teenager, so I know that a man wearing a mask would get a lot of attention and be a bit more threatening than this."
45,18,"I've seen a lot of people say that the government 'is trying to stop the spread of a virus'. It would be so bad that it would get people to think about it, even though they don't understand it."
45,28,"I've never seen a joke or made a joke about my grandfather wearing a mask because I have no idea how he came off. He does not understand the need for it, and has not had any real problems with it. I am talking about his friend's situation, and it's a good reminder of how much I hate this kind of joke."
47,45,"In the current state of Florida, they are requiring people to wear a mask. There's a huge difference."
49,45,"My parents have the same concern about the spread of the virus. They're concerned that it will spread like mad. They can't just get a mask from the doctors and just let a child get them a flu, they don't think that the vaccines won't do much. They also say the lack of vaccines doesn't solve the problem, and if the vaccine fails, they'll have to send the person to a ER."
52,45,So how are you supposed to go about dressing up as Santa? Because Santa's the person who wants the public to know.
55,45,I am afraid of being called out on it by a non-English speaker and getting my head scratched by a language barrier.
56,45,"I don't know about anyone but my husband who is allergic to the flu and I get a concussion by wearing a mask. It is not a very good idea, but it is kind of a bad idea. I wore a mask once when I was sick to protect myself from an infection. I wasn't really sure how long I had been wearing it."
57,45,"Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. The only thing that can actually prevent you from getting a virus is a good mask, and that if the employee was wearing a mask while in a mask at work he was going to have a hr contact with a paramedic."
75,45,I'm not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. Is this a joke? Vaccines aren't needed. A pandemic isn't a pandemic. They aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
82,45,I am sorry that I didn't see the context correctly. The mask thing is pretty uninspiring.
92,45,"""As a former medic who worked in public health and a doctor who travelled to Europe to help infected people, I can confirm this:"
94,45,I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,45,"Is this a joke? Because if I was a teenager and they say that a man wearing a mask isn't a joke, then they're just doing shit."
45,18,">The government isn't a good idea. The health care system isn't a good idea."""
45,28,"""I've never seen a joke or made a joke about my grandfather wearing a mask because I have no idea how he came off. He does not understand the need for it, and has not had any real problems with it. I am talking about his friend's situation, and it's a good reminder of how much I hate this kind of joke."""
47,45,This is just an example of what the government is doing when it comes to protecting itself.
49,45,Vaccines are often used to help people get into a better place. If you don't want to do them you are in the wrong place and causing yourself to die. A good way is to put a small piece of plastic wrap in your mouth and inhale and then put it on a cold.
52,45,"> I think the problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic. Is the actual reason for the fear in the US?"
55,45,That's how it is supposed to be done - they have to.
56,45,"“>I don't believe that we are seeing a virus, only a doctor who is in the U.S....?... and then he says I think that Well, in the US, you'd still have to go through a whole process of ensuring that someone in the US isn't exposed to the disease, so we're not denying the fact that people who aren't exposed to the disease are on the hook for a concussion."
57,45,"They use a mask to obliterate the spreading of a virus, which is pretty standard, in the US, and doesn't seem to be the case anymore."
75,45,"I think it's more of a joke that this govt wants the government to fix the issue, rather than a thing to be ashamed of."
82,45,This is one of the reasons I don't think any of these issues are about the masks. They're about the lack of the right thing to do in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. I have seen this many times but never had the opportunity to say what a mask would do.
92,45,"They want to make it illegal, but don't say that they do. They want the government to tell us what they want to do based on how you think. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
94,45,We all have it bad. It's actually worse. I love people who go to the hospital with a disease and the people I am sick with. This whole apnea thing is very scary.
95,45,"It doesn't say I'm a teenager, it just says I like to know that people care about the spread of a virus. That's why we have a government where they don't get the vaccinations that we don't need."
45,18,"In the OP's comment I'm pointing out that the government is trying to make health care a good idea. In general, people are trying to create and sustain a healthy and reliable health care system. But it's also just being a ""supposed"" policy."
45,28,"It's kind of silly and ridiculous, but I still hate a lot of this."
47,45,Wearing a mask in a hospital is something that people shouldn't be forced to do. In some states it's not a proper mask. A medical certificate isn't necessary to wear a mask.
49,45,"If you do it in a public place, it is illegal to wear one, and your parents can just keep it to themselves."
52,45,No. We're just reiterating what the joke is and how people should not wear masks.
55,45,"""Why are people saying that the mask mandate is required to protect against HIV is necessary to prevent someone who doesn't have HIV in public to get a vaccine."""
56,45,">I'm a total nutjob. I think your husband's gf is making the most of your comment - but if you're an honest person, then you're missing the point of this whole thread."

75,45,"They want a pandemic epidemic to spread around the world, and that pandemic isn't going to get worse. They want a pandemic epidemic, and that pandemic has no place there."
82,45,You are pretty well versed in the medical terminology of fecal vaccine.
92,45,Vaccines are not illegal. They are not legal. The only thing preventing people from getting a virus is preventing them from getting ebola. Vaccines are illegal. And they are NOT legal. And they aren't required. The CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal.
94,45,"There's so many bad things happening right now that the whole issue of apnea is frightening, he's a dick."
95,45,"The gov't is not the one that's taking their own kids to the doctor, and there's not any evidence for the fact that it is the only reason that a man wearing a mask doesn't get vaccinated, and there are a LOT of other, more commonly stated reasons for why people don't get vaccinated."
45,18,I think this is the most funny comment I've read on this subreddit so far. The CDC is doing a great job of making people aware of their options to get sick so they can help. I'm glad you're getting some clarity and hope you find some common ground.
45,28,"I've always liked how the government is being politically unpopular because of these things, especially the fact that a doctor is in an area where people don't go to their doctor."
