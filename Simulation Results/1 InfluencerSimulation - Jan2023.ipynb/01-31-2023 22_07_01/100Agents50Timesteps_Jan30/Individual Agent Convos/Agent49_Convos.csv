97,49,I was a little bit uncomfortable when I was a kid. My mother always swore that I wouldn't wear my mask because I'm old. When I was a kid she still was afraid to wear a mask.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I've been out in the south for a while. I've been wearing a mask and a hl suit in the past few months.

69,49,"I do not think a new virus is likely to come through Florida, so I don't see where it's coming from."
78,49,In the words of OP:
81,49,"""I think a mask is a useful tool to protect yourself from people from the spread of a virus. I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,49,"My dad says he uses a plastic surgeon to help keep patients safe. I don't believe that it will save any lives, as most people get all fecal."
92,49,"It doesn't annoy me that some people do not realize that ""Sterilizing hands when returning from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it does remind people that ""Standardizing hands when returning home from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it is not mandatory to sterilize your hands after leaving work."
97,49,I am going to give you a ring today! I don't think I've ever been able to stop myself. The virus has only been there for about one month now. And I'm going to go and buy a mask if I am sick. If I don't I won't be able to stop the virus.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I'm pretty sure it's really helpful and it's something that will help people in Florida. But if you don't know what to do you have to go fuck yourself. There's no vaccine that will prevent fecal. And if you don't know what's infected you have to make a doctor come and give you some antibiotics.
49,33,This is why I always wear a mask when I am out and about.
49,34,>I am so sorry mark but I don't trust this vaccine
49,38,I think it's a very good thing they have taken this measure to stop the spread of a virus.
49,45,It is not a vaccine. It is a vaccination. It is not a cure.
49,48,Your mother's mother can't say anything about how she feels about being able to avoid getting a virus in her face or anything like that. She's not able to be as respectful as a child and it seems she's not able to do her job.
60,49,"We've been tasked with a mission to stop the spread of a virus.To make it worse, it would be more difficult to stop the spread of the virus. And it's very important for the disease to be detected and treated."
69,49,"I'm just not sure what the word means, but you said it a few times - and I've always been infected with that 'I'm good i'm still wearing my mask'."
78,49,"I think the problem is that wearing a mask means you're not infected, you're attracted to the person."
81,49,"I had a medical condition called covi once and it was a severe flu. I was a very good boy, so I am a little scared and my mum got a flu, too."
82,49,[NAME] is a man who uses a plastic surgeon to keep patients safe. [NAME] was in the US army.
92,49,"There is a lot of misunderstanding here. The mandate of the vaccine is to prevent infections by preventing ebola. And it doesn't mean they need a mask to prevent them from getting sick. But when it comes to the CDC, the government is essentially going to make vaccines illegal if they don't do it."
97,49,Is there something that is a lie?
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"Yes, you have to wear a mask."
49,33,"The CDC is helping to keep children infected with the virus. The government is helping keep children infected with the virus.

I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
49,34,I think the vaccine should be legalized as a medical tool because we do not have it in our country. So you have to go to your local govt office to have the vaccine. That's about the best you can do for you.
49,38,"I think a few other comments can help give you a better idea of how to treat your mother's flu. It's not a joke, it's just not the right thing to do. I don't want to be called an asshole, but it's definitely not a joke."
49,45,"My parents have the same concern about the spread of the virus. They're concerned that it will spread like mad. They can't just get a mask from the doctors and just let a child get them a flu, they don't think that the vaccines won't do much. They also say the lack of vaccines doesn't solve the problem, and if the vaccine fails, they'll have to send the person to a ER."
49,48,"Yes - I am in Florida, so I'm scared and infected."
60,49,"And then, at the last minute, the government shows up."
69,49,"I know a lot of people who are able to stop it, and I really don't see why they can't. What is wrong with preventing it? I don't care what other people say about preventing it. But, it's a bad thing to do. I know lots of people who don't know how to stop it. That's the best way to stop it. I mean, it can't be the right thing to do, just the wrong thing to do."
78,49,">I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
81,49,"The guy who made the poster that said ""Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."" It's actually a pretty big joke, considering the way he speaks."
82,49,"The fecal vaccine is one of the most harmful diseases in the world. It's not just the viruses, but the whole fecal thing."
92,49,"""I don't understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the vaccine wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere"""
97,49,The wikipedia article says that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is an unnecessary act of government inflicted on the public.

49,34,Are you a guy? You know you need to be at a med school.
49,38,I am sorry you are in this situation. I am an Army man and I am sure you would find that an excellent idea and not a joke.
49,45,Vaccines are often used to help people get into a better place. If you don't want to do them you are in the wrong place and causing yourself to die. A good way is to put a small piece of plastic wrap in your mouth and inhale and then put it on a cold.
49,48,I'm glad I'm not the only one who got into a fad.
60,49,You need to wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please
69,49,I don't think I'm joking about this.
78,49,I feel bad for the man who was wearing a mask on his first flight in months.
81,49,"He was a bit of a naive child who was never vaccinated. But at this point it's a lot more important that we take care of people, as well as that it's the best way to prevent a child from getting a cold or the worst way to protect themselves. It's not fair that this is a popular joke, and it's probably a good way to get kids to come along."
82,49,The guy in this is getting all pissed off that it's not a bad idea to not wear a mask at all.
92,49,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
97,49,"I was very young. I was just about to walk out of the store. I saw an old man in a mask, and I swore he would never wear his mask."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I think the joke he makes is that I was in a different plane than the people he met.
49,33,I grew up in the South but have lived in a lot of places in the South. My aunt used to live on the streets in a rural area and I would smear it on the streets when she was sick. We had to take it off because she was sick and had to leave.
49,34,I am not sure how I should react to this.
49,38,"I think it's very funny to read this, and I've never gotten a response to that shit."
49,45,"If you do it in a public place, it is illegal to wear one, and your parents can just keep it to themselves."
49,48,>Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,49,i thought the joke was shady..?
69,49,I'm actually a doctor in the U.S. and I don't wear a mask in public anymore.
78,49,"I'm a mother of two children, and i wear a mask all the time. I'm sure it's funny but also not funny at all. I don't understand why it's funny."
81,49,"Is it like that Santa actually has a mask on? It’s a bit of a joke in that he’s wearing a mask, not a helmet, and doesn’t like being told to put his face on. The santa is wearing a mask, and the mask is on. But it’s actually a great joke, considering the way he speaks. I think it’s a good way to get kids to come along."
82,49,I don't see the problem. But you need to be clear.
92,49,"I've heard that if the CDC sucks it'll be a very serious problem for us Americans. It was a joke at first, and it was a joke at the time, and it's not."
97,49,"I didn't want to say that. I mean a guy I knew wore a mask, and it got him sick and I'd go to work and put on some masks."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I thought the joke was shady..? I'm actually a doctor in the U.S. and I don't wear a mask in public anymore.
49,33,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
49,34,>I'm actually a doctor in the U.S. and I don't wear a mask in public anymore. I'm sure it's funny but also not funny at all. I don't understand why it's funny. I've heard that if the CDC sucks it'll be a very serious problem for us Americans.
49,38,I don't even like to put on masks. I always thought this joke was hilarious.
49,45,"People are going to be going to the hospital if they see a flu. In a public place, it's illegal. They aren't going to if there's a fever."
49,48,>The guy in this is getting all pissed off that it's not a bad idea to not wear a mask at all. Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
60,49,No I don't know. This is a joke.
69,49,This is pretty much an all encompassing thing.
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the disease.
81,49,I read the title and thought it was a joke...
82,49,"He's a doctor, not a politician, just a guy."
92,49,"If there were any actual medical reasons that were a joke, then I'd probably have a problem with them. That's the point. I am not sure if the law makes sense for a doctor to make that joke a joke, but it's an absurd one, especially since they're all very specific things."
97,49,>I think it's kind of a great idea to keep a veil around your body in case a virus gets through your eyes.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,">I think it's kind of a great idea to keep a veil around your body in case a virus gets through your eyes. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,33,I had this joke once. I was wearing a mask and it made me sick and have been to a number of clinics. I was actually infected and was going to get vaccinated and the doctor didn't even know.
49,34,I am not sure how to respond to the entire sentence because I don't follow it. I just read the title and thought this was funny.
49,38,"There is only one possible way to prevent flu, and that is not to say that you're being stupid."
49,45,"I'm also a doctor, but I don't go out much."
49,48,"I would probably have a problem with a vaccine, but I'm not sure if that's what the real problem is - a virus."
60,49,You're being very harsh.
69,49,"It's kinda like this: ""They've seen HIV on my hand""."
78,49,"I think the problem is that wearing a mask means you're not infected, you're attracted to the person."
81,49,You don't know how the government does that to children. They are not being given the chance to get vaccines if they're at risk.
82,49,"The NSA doesn't have any official responsibility for protecting people who are being attacked by some guy, but does have a responsibility to prevent it from being spread."
92,49,"There is no way that any of those people are gonna see the law. If they get sick and aren't able to come and see a doctor to explain the law, it isn't really going to work."
97,49,>I wear a mask in my work hats. What a prick.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"I think the problem is that wearing a mask means you're not infected, you're attracted to the person. You don't know how the government does that to children."
49,33,In the first paragraph I'm not sure which sentence would he actually read? He's being a little too explicit about what he's doing here.
49,34,"I was a doctor for a year, and I thought I had a really big problem with viruses, so I'm thinking I need a mask now."
49,38,"I think you were actually infected and went to a number of clinics. I was actually infected and was going to get vaccinated and the doctor didn't even know. I don't want to be called an asshole, but it's definitely not a joke."
49,45,This is very specific to the situation.
49,48,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
60,49,A lot of things can make me feel pretty awful because of it - I'm a little uneasy.
69,49,"I'd never even thought of the concept of ""I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like that, but they're not the most sensitive of people, and most of the time they are. I don't see how anyone would feel at all when people do such an important thing like that."
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the virus. The whole idea is a joke.
81,49,"As someone who's already heard it, I'm surprised you don't understand this quote."
82,49,"> ""(As a doctor, I can say that he is a doctor, not a politician. But I'm saying that they need to go and look at this more, or else they will become more violent. He's a doctor, not a politician. But I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done. I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done."
92,49,"The first part of the joke that comes up is that ""...We are not legal. and they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal."""
97,49,"""But if there is a virus or a virus spreads, then I would wear a mask to stop the spread."""
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"As a physician, I can tell you that when I went to the US, people told me that there is no vaccine to prevent a virus from spreading. However, the fact is, people are getting a virus from a vaccinated person, and the vaccine doesn't actually come out of the fecal or venous infectiosis. There is a CDC website. It's actually a joke."
49,33,"It's all very important and so is the issue of why people should be afraid of things. So if we do a thing that would prevent it from spreading, how would we know it's actually not being done?"
49,34,That's a very bad quote. You're being very offensive and demeaning.
49,38,I figured it would be a bit off - i do not know why people would be embarrassed.
49,45,"""Well, I wear a mask in my work hats - and I wear it all the time."""
49,48,The whole idea is a joke.
60,49,A lot of things can make me feel pretty awful because of it. A lot of things can make me feel pretty awful because of it - I'm a little uneasy.
69,49,CANNOTANSWER – I don't know what to tell you about this. I'm actually a doctor in the U.S. and I don't wear a mask in public anymore.
78,49,A very nice joke. I'm gonna go with you.
81,49,"I'm the CDC's director, and I know that's a shit load of kids, but this whole 'what if i'm sick of a virus' thing is pretty tame. I think this is a good idea because it is a funny, but annoying joke."

97,49,>I wear a mask in my work hats. What a prick.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I just realized that I really didn't know he was referring to the people that were getting the virus.
49,33,CANNOTANSWER:
49,34,"My professor told me that he doesn't know what he's talking about. And he was just like ""you have a great idea. And I'm going to come to an AMA with you, please!"" I can't get any other explanation for this."
49,38,It's a joke. Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the virus.
49,45,"In America, it's the flu. The government will just kill the flu. You are getting the virus, no less. But you're being very offensive and demeaning."
49,48,"As a man who has fought a war in many states over the years and fought to ensure the safety of all those who are currently living in countries with less than 1 percent of a population, and that most aren't getting vaccines as much as other countries, and I'm a scumbag. I don't think you're going to find that any of this is about the lack of public protection of children. This is really just a case of people being harmed because of it."
60,49,I don't think the AMA should make a joke about this.
69,49,I just made a big joke about a woman doing it. This is not a joke. I don't know if that is a joke.
78,49,"I didn't really see the joke about wearing a mask, but rather about a man with AIDS who didn't wear a mask."
81,49,"> I don't see how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
82,49,I don't think the AMA is going to convey anything.
92,49,"If they were gonna see the law, then it would be a joke."
97,49,"'I'm pretty sure that if a person can't be the best person on earth to make a joke about a mask, it's not a joke. Wearing a mask in your work hats is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"That's a great way to keep the health of the fecal population from spreading the virus, but it's not a joke. If someone is getting it through a mouth, they won't stop it."
49,33,I'm not sure what you're talking about. I think it's the fact that the professor is making a joke.
49,34,"In a country with so much violence, this joke doesn't even have to be joke. It's a joke."
49,38,It's a joke because the government is bringing it out of the closet and then putting it back in the closet to help people. But no one is going to be the apologist for that.
49,45,>What a prick. Wearing a mask in my work hats. What a prick. Wearing a mask in your work hats. What a prick. Wearing a mask in your work hats is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
49,48,This is the worst AMA ever for people who are sick of the flu.
60,49,What a jerk. The government is a joke.
69,49,The CDC does not have the resources to prevent people with HIV/AIDS from getting any other forms of vaccine.
78,49,"I feel like it's funny because it sucks for a lot of people, but what is the point of doing it? Do they know they don't need to wear the masks? Because they have an infectious disease. Its a joke."
81,49,"In the US, there's actually a few different people who were able to tell the difference between the two."
82,49,I think that he should be out of school.
92,49,"Yes, a joke is a joke."

I don't like that he is making a joke about something that's not a joke, but he isn't getting to do it."

49,34,"Apparently it isn't a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."

60,49,You are right. That's what he says.
69,49,I don't understand why people who think a joke is made about the government are getting into a funk right now. I don't think this a joke. That's not a joke.

81,49,"...I see that this joke is a joke, but it is not a joke."
82,49,That's a pretty big lie. The government is only concerned with the “protection” of people who aren't being attacked by people. There's no real sense of responsibility to protect people who are being attacked. A little bit of humor isn't always necessary. I don't think anyone's going to give a shit about how ridiculous and narcissistic the jokes are in order. And what exactly is a joke about?
92,49,"I've been in the CDC for three years and it's absolutely the worst way I've ever been in my life. I can't see the difference between a joke and a joke. It was a joke at first, but the point is the government is pushing an illegal policy, not a joke."

81,49,This is what I am going to say:
82,49,"This is why so many people are mad because they are afraid of getting a virus, as well as because they have a virus. The CDC is a very powerful company and the most powerful group in the world. I think they will make a joke out of it."
92,49,There's literally no point to making a joke about your job and having a job.

I know we have to make it a joke, but I don't think the AMA is going to make us think they should, and we are going to start doing something that will be a joke, instead of just making it a joke. That's just a joke. But it's going to be a joke."
49,45,AMAs don't come close to the point of being jokes.
49,48,What's a joke about the government?
60,49,"It's funny because people try to joke, and it's like ""I'm going to write up a book about how to be a man,"" but not because it's a joke."
69,49,There are some really serious problems here:
78,49,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. You don't have to make a joke if you don't want to.
81,49,It's a joke about the government. I'm so glad it's not in a joke that it doesn't make sense.
82,49,A little bit of humor isn't necessarily necessary. The AMAs are a bit of a joke. There's really only one thing that can do something that has nothing to do with the AMA: a joke that talks about a vaccine.
92,49,This isn't really a joke. It's a joke that is intended to be funny and made to convey a moral and ethical point.
97,49,"""This sucks, but there is a joke in this subreddit about the government 'teach' to use the CDC's ""help"" and not to be a joke, you can do whatever you want."

49,2,"Is the CDC actually in Texas, a public hospital?"
49,33,"No jokes. I don't get what your mom's saying, I'm skeptic."
49,34,There are AMAs on r/religiousjokes. It’s a naive and stupid joke. They’re aimed at the public and it’s not to keep people from having their health impacted by the CDC.
49,38,It's a joke that it's supposed to convey a moral and ethical point.
49,45,"CANNOTANSWER: In a lot of the AMA I can't find anywhere else has been able to help, but I've found more than just a few examples of a lot of people trying to get their hands on the vaccine."
49,48,It's a joke that isn't about the government.
60,49,"""You seem like a joke. Not really a joke. Those words are literally jive."
69,49,"If we do want to do something about that and make people uncomfortable, we need a new one."
78,49,People don't know what a joke is. The point is that it's funny. It's funny because it's funny. It's funny because it's funny. It's funny because it's funny.
81,49,It seems like the government is making fun of the government as a joke. It's a joke because people are not immune from it and don't know how it works.
82,49,"The whole idea of a ""fecal vaccine"" in the military is not very good, in fact, it’s bad. The AMA is a joke."
92,49,The CDC doesn't have a mandate to sterilize your hands when he is out of work. They only require that you have a license to use them. The federal government doesn't want to make it illegal.
97,49,>What is the point of wearing a mask if you don't have a phobia? Are you a joke? Because that's not a joke.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"You know, the jokes are not that funny, they are a joke that is intended to be funny and made to convey a moral and ethical point."
49,33,I think that this joke is very relevant.
49,34,"I think the jokes are aimed at the public because they're about the government, not the government."
49,38,AMA is about the government bringing the virus out of the closet to help people stop it from spreading.
49,45,Its a joke. Its not a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke.
49,48,"AMAs aren't about the government, they're about the government."
60,49,"As someone who had been asked to do an AMA with a virus, I can confirm that AMAs are a joke."
69,49,"People in public, such as yourself, need a better excuse to live their life with the idea that they can take care of the problems and help people."

97,49,"I'm a prick. And you know I don't have a problem with a cdc. But it's one thing to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV, it's another to wear a mask to be able to stop the spread of the virus."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I think that there's a way to prevent spreading of this virus. The public needs to know what's funny and a way to avoid it.
49,33,"And then, in the end, people start to realise that a joke isn't a joke if it's meant to be a joke."
49,34,"I know they're a joke but the point of the joke is to tell people that the government is trying to help. The joke is about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. People don't know what a joke is. People don't know what a joke is. The whole idea of a ""fecal vaccine"" in the military is not very good, in fact, it's bad."
49,38,The AMA is about the government's efforts to prevent a clone from spreading. That's why the AMA was created.
49,45,"“We have a really high risk of contracting and getting AIDS. They don’t want to get vaccinated, but we can’t do anything about it.”"
49,48,"This is what doctors in general do when it comes to public health issues, and I'm pretty sure the most common thing that makes them laugh is that if they vaccinate, they go on the internet and make funny jokes about the government."
60,49,"A good AMA is about helping the public, but it isn't the same thing. It's about helping people. But a good AMA is about helping people."
69,49,Vaccine Advocacy.
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The whole idea is a joke.
81,49,It's funny because it's about the CDC. And santa doesn't even have a title. It's a joke because the government is trying to stop it... and I think a clone is a joke. Because it's a joke.
82,49,We're gonna have a real question with that AMA. If he's not at the University I'd be afraid of him getting hurt and having a big family.
92,49,It's a joke.
97,49,"I... I don't get what you are saying but I know what you're saying. There are people who make jokes, but there isn't anything good about it."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"The joke isn't really a joke. It's a joke, not a bad one, because people don't realize what a joke is."

49,45,">If they are able to get them in the hospital and don't want to have to go, then they're not going to be able to put a person in the hospital. I think that's not a joke."
49,48,"I'm a man, and it's a joke. I'm not a politician, and I know a lot of doctors who are serious about getting vaccinated. I don't understand why people don't get vaccinated. Vaccines are for life."
60,49,"I think there's some ambiguity between the words ""joke"" and ""joke."" And one has the words ""joke"" which is a word that says ""joke."" And that's where I'm coming from."
69,49,"Yes. They should definitely put a ban on the government wearing a mask in public, as far as preventing infection."
78,49,"If it's a joke, I can't see how this can be interpreted as a joke if the person in question is an expert or a doctor or anything else."
81,49,"'' I don't understand how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
82,49,What is the difference between being a doctor and being a politician?''

97,49,I think we're in the wrong subreddit.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

49,33,I'm assuming that's a joke.
49,34,"This is one of the most dangerous things in the world. It makes the person on the street more likely to die from something they don't actually think about, and makes it harder for the person to find out. Vaccines are a joke."

49,45,What a prick.
49,48,People who make jokes don't just keep saying it.

69,49,"It's not about the government, it's about the CDC."
78,49,"I am a doctor, and I have an infection. I am going to be a doctor, so I am going to have to try and get vaccinated. It is a joke. It isn't funny at all."
81,49,"The UK has a joke about a clone, as in a joke of how santa doesn't seem to know why"
82,49,"People often make jokes about the AMA, but they usually get a joke from the people who make them. So, the actual thing is that he's going to give the jokes that aren't jokes. But, it is just a joke."
92,49,"Then your first comment on this thread should be titled ""Which state are you in?"""
97,49,"I don't like a lot of the jokes in the first place, but the first two ones."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"Considering you had no idea that the CDC was the one to use the 'A' as a joke, I'm going to say I don't see what he meant by that"
49,33,"What's funny is that some AMAs aren't about the government, but about the people who get sick - and that's probably one of the reasons that they are funny to me. I also think the CDC is using the AMA as an excuse for not wanting people to know the difference between a virus and a joke."
49,34,AMAs aren’t jokes. They’re just comments. It’s a joke.
49,38,I think that's a lot of things to ask yourself.
49,45,"In the UK, I believe that the joke is funny."
49,48,"In a similar way, wearing a mask and being vaccinated is not considered a joke."
60,49,AMAs are a very broad term for the general public and also refers to the public and the government in general. AMA's are usually about the government's role and the CDC as it is.
69,49,I've heard that the CDC flies in a crowded office that has some sort of inpatient mental health care program.
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The whole idea is a joke. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life.
81,49,It's funny because it's a joke about the government. And santa isn't supposed to know why it's a joke.
82,49,"I would be concerned that they are too afraid to bury their heads in the dirt while the AMA is on, because a fecal vaccination doesn't work."
92,49,I'm confused and confused because they do not use vaccines and I think it's wrong.
97,49,"It's a joke, the CDC doesn't have a specific purpose. There's a lot of things you need to make up a joke about."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"AMAs are about the government. The CDC is not telling a joke about the government. They are telling a joke about people being sick from a virus. There is no vaccine that will prevent the spread of a virus. Unless you have some sort of medical job you won't be allowed to vaccinate anyone, you won't be allowed to make any such jokes."
49,33,"The AMA was about preventing and protecting people. The point was that the CDC was trying to cut people's lives, as they're trying to cut people's lives."
49,34,"I think it's a joke because the people I talk to who are just trying to tell jokes and AMAs have not made it a joke, and I think they are actually just jokes. The jokes themselves aren't a joke either."
49,38,"In the US and in the UK, the AMA is about the government's efforts to prevent a clone from spreading."
49,45,"I think that the CDC is a joke, and that people who wear masks are the joke."
49,48,"There are plenty of jokes on here. You know, 'If I were in the CDC, I wouldn't be on a limb of not knowing why you don't get vaccinated and I'd still feel like my name was on my computer?'"
60,49,"AMAs are about the government and their role in the virus. You don't AMA with an AMA. If you don't think that's a joke, the AMA is about the government. A good AMA is not. A AMA is about the CDC."
69,49,I'm not sure what this is about.
78,49,"What a joke! I'm so sick of hearing how you talk about this joke, because you can't believe how bad it is. I'd rather not be a doctor, but my wife's son was a doctor. He's probably not a doctor."
81,49,I was raised in a CDC clone.
82,49,"“If you like the president, and then you want to leave, and this happens, then you are a political figure.”"
92,49,Do you have a job with the CDC?
97,49,It is a joke because it isn't a joke. The jokes have a specific purpose.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,">I'm a very socially conservative person, and I don't wear a mask anymore. I don't want to wear it anymore."
49,33,"The AMA - I think people are being skeptic, they think it's funny because they aren't telling a joke about the government. They are not telling a joke about the government. It is a joke, and I hate it."
49,34,"As a former GP, I find it amusing that there are a lot of different jokes about the government and their shaming to the government. I'm surprised that this one doesn't get picked out as a joke in the US."
49,38,"AMAs are about the CDC, not the government."
49,45,"As a parent, it's not even fair to assume the doctor is the one who's getting it and putting it on a sick child. Rather, the doctor has to be an expert on the subject."
49,48,"""As a man who has fought a war in many states over the years and fought to ensure the safety of all those who are currently living in countries with less than 1 percent of a population, and that most aren't getting vaccines."","
60,49,"""Well it's the government that is trying to make the government a joke, and I think it's a good joke if you're going to stop it."""
69,49,There is not enough information on the Internet to make a joke. The CDC and the people who have the vaccine have nothing to fear or anything to worry about.
78,49,"IANAL, but the only one who seems to agree with it is the one who wrote ""I don't think it's funny"" and ""I think it's funny because it's funny and I hate it."

It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke about the government. It's not a joke because it's the government's only The word clone in the joke is just a joke about what the clone is.
82,49,"It's a joke, but not a joke."
92,49,"They are in Texas so you don't have a job with the CDC. I don't want to say I don't think they are a joke, but they're a joke. They're a joke about what they are doing."
97,49,So you've got a lot of people that don't like the joke?
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I don't think they're trying to make the joke funny.

82,49,This is about the government trying to get patients to keep their lives safe and protect people from getting infected. You should know that the only thing you can do for people to keep safe is to keep your heads in the dirt while the AMA is on. AMAs aren't about what the government wants to do.

49,38,"I'm in the Army, and I like to put on masks as well. I can't even believe they do."
49,45,... and [sic](http://www.fos.gov/repair/evidence/as_teach_the_virus_problem_in_feebles/index.php?docid=139998_29927#faqd8b8b6ahgbo).
49,48,There's a lot of people who are sick of that.
60,49,It is a joke because people get sick of that kind of stuff.
69,49,Vaccine Advocacy.
78,49,I think that's a good joke.
81,49,"Is it just a joke that you are a bit of a joke about? I don't see how that's a joke. It's a joke because the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus, but it's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke about the government. It's a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke about the government and its mandates."
82,49,"I think this is an interesting read, but AMA isn't about the AMA. It's about the AMA in the military. AMA is a joke. It's about what the government has to do, not what they want to do."
92,49,"They are a joke, and it is not inherently bad. They are not supposed to be a joke and there are not no real legal reasons to do so. They have to be illegal."
97,49,I am not even sure what the joke is.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I'd give them a break. They don't do the things that are actually meant to be funny and a joke about how they're not the issue but they're just saying it's a joke.
49,33,AMA about the CDC?
49,34,AMAs are just comments.
49,38,"As I said before, I don't think that AMA is funny, but it's a joke. This AMA is a joke about the government attempting to prevent the spread of a virus."
49,45,"[Mrs. Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard-T. Johnson). He wrote: ""We have a really high risk of contracting and getting AIDS. They don’t want to get vaccinated, but we can’t do anything about it. I think it’s a joke because it’s a joke because it’s funny because it’s funny and I hate it. I think that’s a joke because it’s funny because it’s funny because it’s funny because it’s"
49,48,"AMAs have some unique meaning. The AMA in particular is an attempt to try to be humorous with people. It's about the government doing something to keep people in line with the government's mandates, but doesn't necessarily have to involve the military. So it's really the same thing."
60,49,"I am a doctor. I had the same problems with getting sick from all of this. In a way, AMAs are actually about preventing the spread of a virus."
69,49,I’m a doctor. It’s a lot of people’s business. The government needs to be there for people. People who are being dicks. I’m a doctor. I don’t care if you’re a joke. And a good person for a good reason.
78,49,"I think the entire point of a joke is to make people think things are 'bad' because they don't have any empathy for the patient. If they are in a coma and don't know how to handle the disease, then they are infected, it would be unfunny for them, and they would be sad if they hadn't been infected. It's funny and they should just keep doing it because it makes them feel better, and they can help the patient in need. If they don't like it, that's a joke"
81,49,"""The best way to tell a joke is to ""let it go."""
82,49,The AMA is a joke that tells you that people get it when you tell them what to do. They say it's a joke. The government is trying to control the world's population. It's about the government.
92,49,I'm a doctor who's been at the CDC and I have a job with them.
97,49,I have an old woman and she wears her mask.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"a lot of people I know say it's funny because of the joke, but it isn't a joke because of it."
49,33,"The point of an AMA is to make people think it's a joke, but is in fact about the government."
49,34,"What's the problem with that? You could be a very very serious health problem, but not always so. People don't have to be very good to be at the center of a joke. You're just not good enough to know that the situation exists, and in the US there is no one who is not going to listen to you or care."
49,38,"I'm a doctor, and I like to put on masks. I'm just going to go back and read it because it’s a joke."
49,45,"It seems you have a lot of things to consider in your post that you don't know about the AIDS. You're asking for this, ""Will if I were you and I'd stop being in the middle of this"" and then you come up with a new one (I think it's time to ask more questions.)"
49,48,"It's funny, it's funny, and it's just a joke. But a joke is a joke. I can see how people would still be laughing about AMAs and jokes about government, but it's a joke and it's not a joke."
60,49,"It's not about the government, it's about the virus. You're just not getting it."
69,49,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenosiculture/TheAIDS-Poors-Drooling-Drooling-Poors-Drooling-Poors-Derooring-Pooring-Pooling-Poors-Along-The-Stay-End-of-Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-As-Poors-Pootion-Pool
78,49,"I'd rather not be a doctor, but I'm going to be a doctor."
81,49,"I think it's more interesting that the government is trying to make people feel better and prevent the spread of the virus. ""But I'm so glad it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke"
82,49,There's nothing on here that is going to make a joke that isn't about the AMA. AMAs are all about the government. They don't really help the AMA.
92,49,"""If you think it's a joke, you can't take it."""
97,49,I'm not sure what the joke is.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,I'm sorry but I do know that the CDC has some good information about vaccines and it's a joke. It's not exactly about vaccines or what is actually the point of a joke.
49,33,"he is telling the truth he needs to be more clear and make it clear he does not want to be the joke. it sucks for a lot of people, but it isn't a joke. people don't get to choose what they want to believe. ""If you think it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because"
49,34,"“That’s funny, but also not funny at all. I’m not sure how to respond to the entire sentence because I don’t follow it. I just read the title and thought this was funny."
49,38,AMA is about the government's efforts to stop the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus.
49,45,"The point of a joke is to make people think things are 'bad' because they don't have any empathy for the patient. If they are in a coma and don't know how to handle the disease, then they are infected, and they don't want to get vaccinated."
49,48,This is one of the most underrated comments I've seen today.
60,49,"The article is also being used as a template for the ""Cave A Trash"" type joke AMA."
69,49,I am not a doctor.
78,49,"I think there is a reason 'not all people'wear masks, and it doesn't explain what is going on. I think it's kind of hilarious for a lot of people to put a hysteria or other shit in the 'hysteria', and I think this makes sense to me to use the phrase 'you don't like it' '."
81,49,Vaccination is the worst type of vaccines. A mask is one thing. It's a joke. But it's a joke because you don't have any idea what a clone is. A clone is a joke. A joke because you don't have any idea what the clone is. And if the government doesn't care what the government is doing. A joke because it doesn't care what the government is doing. The government is working on a vaccine. And I'm so glad that it's a joke
82,49,"A lot of the AMAs aren't jokes. 'How much is it about the AMA and what's not?', 'What is it about if I don't care about the government?', 'When is it about what the government wants to do?', 'Is it about the government's gimmick?''"
92,49,"The CDC is in Texas. The CDC has a 'doctor' license to use them without the consent of the employer. They are there to get the vaccinated patients harmed, and the doctor or sceptics can make a referral to the doctor if needed."
97,49,>What is the point of wearing a mask if you don't have a phobia? Are you a joke? Because that's not a joke. I'm sorry but I don't think this is a joke. The joke is a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. The joke is a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"The CDC is the governing body for a country which has a 'common sense of humor' to that of the government. 'How can I keep people from getting sick from a clone, but you don't know what that is."
49,33,"It's a joke that's about the government, but a joke about the people who get vaccinated."
49,34,"I was able to help my parents stop the spread of the AIDS and I've had to go home, just because we didn't have any medical care for them. It was terrible. I still had no idea that we could help, but I didn't have enough money to pay for it because my family was in the same state. :) I've learned a lot about AIDS and I haven't really had any problems in the past so I could not help them."
49,38,"> I'm a doctor, and I like to put on masks as well. I'm just going to go back and read it because it's funny. I'm going to say I think it's funny because I'm a doctor, and I like to put on masks. I'm just going to go back and read it because it's funny. I'm sorry but I don't think it's funny. I think it's funny because I'm going to say I think it's funny because"
49,45,AMA: A very funny joke.
49,48,"The AMA is being used as a template for the ""Cave A Trash"" type joke AMA. It is a joke because it is not a joke. The AMA is about the government and its purpose is to make people feel better and prevent the spread of the virus."
60,49,"Yes - ""We are a joke."" And when a doctor says, ""You seem like a joke. Not really a joke. They are all really just over the top. They are like saying, ""We should all keep it on the floor."""
69,49,I think the most important thing to remember about the movie is that the movie's creators didn't want a government to do it for a reason that was only aimed at women.
78,49,"A lot of people are trying to go against the CDC's suggestions, like ""You know, if you don't like it, I'd do it!"" or ""I'm sorry, but I'm in the US and I don't wear a mask, I don't want to make it!"""
81,49,"I would be so embarrassed to say I don't think I could possibly understand this joke, and I would want to feel sick and miserable that I had to put on my mask."
82,49,Yes AMAs are about the government.
92,49,The guy is referencing how the CDC was trying to get people to get their hands on the vaccine instead of giving a joke. They are using the CDC to get them to do it. It's all about being able to spoof their message that there's no difference between the CDC and the CDC.
97,49,"A joke, because it's a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"The CDC is making it seem like a joke. The only difference is, there's no such thing as a 'no joke' because there's a lot of the jokes about the government."
49,33,I think they are both sexist.
49,34,AMA. AMA AMAs AMAs. AMAs.
49,38,"In my opinion, the best thing they could do is make people laugh, then go to the doctor, and see if he can actually help a person. This is all about a joke. The AMA is about the government's efforts to stop the spread of the virus."
49,45,"The AMA (with the exception of the AMAs) is not about the government's intentions. It is about the people that get vaccinated. It is about the people that are getting vaccinated, and are willing to work for the government. This is about how we manage the problem."
49,48,"So, there's a story where we find the AMA to be a funny joke about a doctor, a virus, or an American woman."
60,49,"I'm a doctor, and I would think that a very funny AMA would be about preventing the spread of a virus."
69,49,So you think this is a joke about a government being able to prevent the spread of a virus?
78,49,"CANNOTANSWER: I know the saying ""I'd rather not be a doctor, but I'm going to be a doctor."" It sounds like you are right. I know the saying, ""I don't like it, I wouldn't want to wear it."""
81,49,What's your favorite joke?
82,49,"""I think that he should be out of school."
92,49,">Then your first comment on this thread should be titled ""Which state are you in?"""
97,49,"I'm not a joke, it's a joke. It's not a joke. A joke."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,>I don't think he was referring to the people that were getting the virus.
49,33,"""What's funny is that some AMAs aren't about the government, but about the people who get vaccinated. It's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny and I hate it."
49,34,"AMAs are aimed at the general public, not the general public."
49,38,"The problem is that they're trying to make it into a joke. The government is trying to make it into a joke. The AMA is trying to get people to think ""what are we doing?"", ""But no one is going to say it's a joke."
49,45,"The reason I'm putting up with this is that there are people like you. I just don't see a way to do it. You are saying that the CDC isn't doing it right and the government is putting out a great deal of bad publicity, and you are being derogatory. I think there is some overlap between these two things, but I think they are incompatible."
49,48,I've read AMAs a few times in this thread. They all include jokes about the government. And the AMA is not a joke.
60,49,"It sounds like a joke, not a joke. If you feel uncomfortable, you'll feel better, but a little harsh."
69,49,I think the movie is based on the book and not the movie. The movie is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV.
78,49,"As a guy with AIDS, I don't wear a mask. I am not attracted to the person."
81,49,"I think the first part is pretty funny, considering the way he talks."
82,49,"AMAs are not jokes. They are about the government, the government, and the people who make them."
92,49,It is a joke. A joke that is not inherently funny and a joke that is not inherently bad.
97,49,>The joke is a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"Because this is a joke, and the government doesn't have a moral obligation to defend it."
49,33,"It's also interesting to read, ""Hey, I got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."""
49,34,">The whole idea of the vaccine is not very good, in fact, it’s bad."
49,38,"I know this isn't an AMA, but this is a joke."
49,45,I think the joke is an awful joke. It's an awful joke because it's funny and I hate it.
49,48,a few days ago I got sick with an AIDS virus and then the news made a video about it.
60,49,"""We have been tasked with a mission to stop the spread of a virus."""

81,49,I'm so sorry if I owe you a post here!
82,49,"As someone who's served in the US military, I would highly recommend that you read the sidebar on the ""Offensive MAMA"" section of the website, and it will give you a pretty good perspective on the subject."
92,49,"CANNOTANSWER, MD"
97,49,"I don't care if the joke is a joke, I just think it's a joke. I don't see why someone should wear a mask, especially one that can be a joke."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
49,33,"I've been here before, and it's just not very interesting at all."
49,34,I'd rather have an AMA than an AMA. The best you can do for yourself is to keep you busy. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of people who can't stop the spread of the AIDS virus.
49,38,I'm going to go get a new mask and give one to the guy who came up with the idea:
49,45,"CANNOTANSWER, MD I don't understand why people wear masks. It's a joke."
49,48,"AMAs are not about the government, they are about the government. AMAs are about the government. AMAs are not about the government, they are about the government."
60,49,It's not a joke.
69,49,"I don’t know if this is actually a joke or not, but I would be willing to do it."
78,49,"CANNOTANSWER: ""A lot of people who wear a mask at work have no problem with not getting vaccinated and aren't prepared to fight a virus and not have a medical job at home?"
81,49,A clone and a joke are not a joke. A joke is about the government. A joke is about a government. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
82,49,AMA: 'The CDC is a very powerful company and the most powerful group in the world. I think they will make a joke out of it.
92,49,"In terms of the word joke, I'd like to clarify."
97,49,"It's a joke that is intended to be a joke, not to be a joke. It's a joke that isn't a joke because it's intended to be a joke, and you can't make any such jokes out of it. I think the problem here is whether the idea of being able to stop a virus is a joke."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,2,"“I can’t keep a hl suit from getting a virus,”"
49,33,"It's a joke. A joke is about a person, the person who gets sick, and their family."
49,34,As a medical student who's been in the military for a year and I don't know how to respond to an AMA?
49,38,This is the kind of thing that makes it so hard to get people to believe you know a 'joke' is a joke.
49,45,"I'm assuming that, in your opinion, it's a joke and is not a joke. In yours, it is a joke."
49,48,"In general, the AMA is meant to be funny. In terms of the word's intended meaning, the phrase 'odd joke' has a lot more meaning."
60,49,"Yes, I love that one. Totally different than the other."
69,49,"'Some jokes are made out of fact, others aren't."
78,49,I think a lot of people have already been on the same page. So many people get sick.
81,49,"If you don't know what a clone is, don't say ""I think it's funny because I'm a bit of a joke"" -- just say ""I don't know what a clone is"", which is an inconclusive joke that it's actually a joke about the government, because that's not a joke about the government."
