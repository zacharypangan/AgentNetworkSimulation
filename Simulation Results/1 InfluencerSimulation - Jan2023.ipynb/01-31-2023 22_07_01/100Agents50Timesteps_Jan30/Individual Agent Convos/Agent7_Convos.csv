101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"...which is the reason why some people wear masks in the first place, like when I run a mile or so."
11,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,7,i know this isn't true but this is just a joke.
18,7,We all do. We all do.
21,7,This is my favourite way to get vaccinated in general and get some help.
28,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
32,7,I had to walk over the border a few times to get to work and was on the same side of the road.

73,7,"OP, you know how the federal government works, you should go suck at it."
78,7,You're missing the point.
90,7,Oh yea it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus

7,3,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,7,So what would the law be like in Mexico where you can't wear a mask or take an emergency pill?
16,7,>Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again Do you have a family you could meet with and spend time with? Please wear a mask and bend over walking out of the grocery store in florida and i am taking my mask off as i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed at her I am sure that
18,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,7,I am not a physician. This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
28,7,"I'm sure they want to stop this because they're scared of the worst, but I have no reason to worry about it. But it's what is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
32,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
33,7,"[Taskreddit: I'm going to use this as a rebuttal to your fucking comment, because it doesn't fit with my original comment. I'm going to use it as an excuse to make a video that I would not want to hear, because I wouldn't have liked it if the OP did. I'm going to have to ask you about your comment."
40,7,You guys are running at a school bus stop. I would like to nab a fad of some sort that is used for AIDS. The vaccine was a precaution to not wear a mask.
46,7,I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic.
52,7,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."
73,7,Is this a statewide mask mandate? Because there isn't an effective one.
78,7,"Unless you are a doctor who is currently working with someone on a vaccination program, wearing a mask helps prevent that risk."
90,7,"I’m not a terrorist, but I don’t mind if I run in public. I’m not a terrorist, but that’s still a serious question. I wouldn’t be surprised if I went out with my dad for the first time in awhile, but if I did, I would be the only one who would have known about the problem and not get involved, since that’s where most people are."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"This is how a doctor must be told not to wear a mask, and they must have the ability to tell the doctors that, in case they do not, they will wear a mask."
11,7,Vaccination is a mandated vaccine of the US government. This would not be the first time the US has issued a mask.
16,7,"I don't know if you've been around kids in Texas for a long time. It seems like I've been at a school in FL that's been pretty good about using a mask. I don't see why they're not interested in trying to change their laws. I think they're trying to make sure that everyone in their district has a helmet, which is a good idea."
18,7,"I don't understand why people like this can't be helped. A mask can protect you, but it also has the effect that a man can't be stopped."
21,7,You’re basically saying this is the best thing to do and the most'sad' thing to do.
28,7,"My dad is a narco-spray test holder, so when he sees someone who has the adolescent HIV virus he does it every time he goes for it, so he wears his mask when he doesn't get sick or have the vaccine for the virus. Luckily the narco test did not get the virus and they wiped it clean. It's not like it was only me a few years ago."
32,7,"This seems very similar to the ""Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistants Assistants Assistants Assistants Assistant Assistants Assistants Assistants Assistants Assistant Assistants Assistants Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistants Assistants Assistant Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistant Assistants Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant Assistant"
33,7,The thing is that it's called 'anti-virals'....which would not be a good idea.
40,7,It's not a bit ironic that people who have the right to wear a mask will always think that a vaccinated person is the best person on earth. It's not even a matter of whether the mask is required for the mascot. It's just that it's not required for the mascot.
46,7,I don’t think I understand the meaning of ‘supposed to be a tidbit about the government’.
52,7,"People in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't even get it in public because of the risk."
73,7,This is a great one. They must be really proud that you've never done this. It was such a big mistake to write your own story about it in the first place.
78,7,"When I was a kid, it made me very nervous. I was a little scared that I would come down with a virus on my head because I was afraid of it and when I was sick, I was gonna be wearing a mask so I could get some rest. I was terrified that I might get sick. I took off my mask when I was sick and it really helped me a lot."
90,7,"I like wearing a mask because it makes me feel good, especially if it can be hilarious."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,I'd just be willing to be smug as fuck for wearing a mask.
11,7,This is just a little confusing.
16,7,"I believe the link is the only time that I'd like to wear a mask. They have said a lot of good things about wearing a mask: Vaccines and meds are not the only things that may help in recovery. If you haven't been vaccinated, you have a chance to die, but you aren't at a risk of getting a vaccine. If not, you should just wear a mask!"
18,7,"I don't think you understand that your husband and I will be talking about a different issue. That's a really great point that we've all been thinking of. We are both saying ""Hey, I really want to know what the next step will be."" And you are also saying ""We can't stop the spread of a virus. We are unable to prevent it through physical contact, but we must not go through physical contact with the virus."" and you are saying ""We want to see a doctor with a mask"" and you are going to be able to do the"
21,7,> I believe the question is why isn't there an article about a person who does not have a mask? Why should I be told this?
28,7,"My mom tells me she can get away with it, but she wants to be with a doctor who isn't a doctor. We have a doctor that is very knowledgeable in treating people with HIV."
32,7,That's the correct answer. That's what's best for you.
33,7,"That guy needs to tell you a lot about what to wear to get a mask. That's what I've been told countless times before, that I should not wear a mask for a reason."
40,7,"[i.e. the way he talks about the federal government is just so bad, and I don't want to be the one who takes advantage of us. I'm just trying to give the people on here something to think about, and to tell them it should be a piece of legislation to be able to protect against the spread of a virus that isn't gone. People wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. I'm not going to be the one who takes advantage of us."
46,7,">I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic.', 'I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic."
52,7,This isn't a joke. It's a misunderstanding.
73,7,"You're a kid, right?"
78,7,Wearing a mask helps to prevent an infection but does not prevent it from spreading.
90,7,"Apparently it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I feel you're the only person to realize how dumb it is, or how you're the last person you've been with this."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.People in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't even get it in public because of the risk."
11,7,"You are going to get the right message, but a lot of people don't understand the basic idea of a mask and are confused. I don't get the whole message, and this is an important one. I don't want to get into a heated debate, but I do want to help people understand that they do a lot of important, important things in life."
16,7,Is there anything to be said in that paragraph?
18,7,You're both on the same page about the virus. We all have different ideas on what to do about it.
21,7,It was a great response and one that made people laugh and move on.
28,7,"I'm not a doctor, but I think it makes sense that people in this situation are not able to be vaccinated. I can't even think of a valid reason to not wear a mask. Unless they're just curious. The only reason I don't wear a mask is because I've been in the US - and the last time I ran in a car in the states - I'd have been infected - but I'm not sure I'm a pedophile. If I was in a hospital,"
32,7,The whole reason people will wear a mask is to feel good.
33,7,"He said a lot about how to wear a mask in public. It's a joke, and it's being enforced in a way that makes it easier to explain the situation."
40,7,"""We, as the CDC, do not allow people to wear a mask at the Halloween parade, unless the government tries to bring it up, if it works, then we do not have a mandate to do so."
46,7,">Isn't the mask a kind of safety device? And that's about it. Yes it. If there are a lot of people with TB in America who don't want to have to wear a mask to be safe from HIV and the government doesn't care about them, I would have to see a doctor."
52,7,"Having a nasty cold is what makes you an infected individual, not a disease that can be treated through vaccines."
73,7,"It's a huge mistake to make, but it's a huge step towards keeping HIV patients safe. The government doesn't want to let HIV patients be on the plane without a mask, so you're getting an extremely difficult time."
78,7,"People can wear masks, they can also help with the prevention of the spread of a new disease."
90,7,This has to be the most believable line of evidence in any science that there is a way to be a threat to the country.
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,">We are going to get the right message, but a lot of people don't understand the basic idea of a mask and are confused. I don't get the whole message, and this is an important one."
11,7,Is there a government agency in the US that is not implementing it? No.
16,7,It's not a joke. It's a statement.
18,7,Exactly what I was thinking.
21,7,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I'm not saying that the public should have to do anything except put on a mask. I'm not saying that they are necessary."
28,7,"The problem is that the government is needing it up with ""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."" This isn't a joke unless there is a reason why pedophiles aren't allowed to wear a mask."
32,7,It's the reason people wear a mask to feel good. Wearing a mask to go out to a movie.
33,7,What about a movie that explains the importance of the mask?
40,7,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I don't think they should be illegal. They should be voluntary."
46,7,No. It is a joke. There's not one of these jokes I've ever heard. And this was actually a joke from the AMA.
52,7,Not the only reason he's a shill.
73,7,"I read this as ""I think the federal government should go suck at it."" (This is probably the best explanation for why he doesn't want to get a mask."
78,7,> Vaccines are for life. It’s not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
90,7,"This is the sort of thing the NSA says in an interview about the CDC. ""This is not something we should be ashamed of."""
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"I would have to tell people in texas that it's not acceptable to wear a mask if you don't want to get a sick person to leave, and to do so with the intention of preventing the spread of a virus. That will just be a hoax and not prevent a virus from circulating."
11,7,alot of people don't understand the basic idea of a mask.
16,7,I am so glad you're not one of the people that actually read it.
18,7,"I read this as a bit of a racial commentary on a joke about an ""I wear a mask because I don't want to get sick and that it's very harmful for my health. I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two. I think the NSA could be right - they don't need a mask to prevent a virus. A few months ago a guy blew my mind. It was just a joke about an ""I wear a mask, but I've been adio"
21,7,People need to take precautions if they are in a hurry. People need to make sure that they don't go afoul of the policies they are in force.
28,7,"What if it's one of those ""I can't even think of a valid reason"" jokes and I've been injected and cured?"
32,7,I think you are going to say the same thing about some other movies you mentioned in this thread.
33,7,>It's hard to believe that it's a joke. I think the movie is hilarious. It's not about the issue of a virus.
40,7,I was wondering why they wouldn't let people wear their masks on school buses because they weren't being safe and I wondered why they would be wearing them because it made them look so out of place. It was an interesting little movie.

52,7,"I don't care about you, the fact that they're making this joke is a joke. Unless the doctors are trying to prevent pandemics, they can't afford it."
73,7,It's just a federal mandate. They have no right to put HIV patients on planes without a mask. They just want to keep the health of their fellow citizens safe. This is a problem that has not been addressed in the public eye.
78,7,There's a lot going on in this thread here.
90,7,"It seems like the government has little or no respect for people who don't know that wearing a mask is a risky thing, or that it is in fact a risky thing to do."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Not the only reason he's a shill. I read this as ""I think the federal government should go suck at it."" (This is probably the best explanation for why he doesn't want to get a mask."
11,7,"Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile and you are not going to stop the spread of a virus. It's a red flag for the government."
16,7,"A good prank about people who don't care to be protected is a dick move. I really have to make a big deal of this, because that is a horrible prank and I'm a dick."
18,7,Isn't this from the CDC?
21,7,You're not a doctor.
28,7,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."""
32,7,That movie just seems to be bringing up a lot of issues. Aside from the obvious.
33,7,This is my favorite movie! It's a joke about the AMA and what a joke.
40,7,"I don't think any rape group is saying that this is ""politics and morals"" or ""politics."" What they are saying is that ""the government has failed in the fight against HIV""."
46,7,...and I don't think there is a difference between the government and the public.
52,7,"I'm a doctor who worked for a government agency that started to research this. Apparently, the most common type of medical care is to get a mask that prevents the spread of an illness."
73,7,What's the problem? Does he have the power to do it on the government? Or is it some other kind of legislation?
78,7,It sounds like they're taking a joke of a joke. If they're not. And I'm saying that it's a funny joke.
90,7,"It's also possible that wearing a mask prevents people from fapping other people, and also could stop people from fapping themselves, because that's what I do. It seems like the government has little or no respect for people who don't know that wearing a mask helps prevent a virus from spreading."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,You’re taking a prank with your comment.
11,7,"I don't know how it was a joke, but I can definitely understand how people would get mad that they wore a mask. It sounds like the government would be doing something in the name of protecting themselves and getting out of there. Isn't it nice that they are willing to pay for the doctor's assistant?"
16,7,"In this thread, it tries to point out a hilarity that comes from having lived in a state that is infected by viruses. I've been a part of a few school districts that have had pedophiles."
18,7,"I am an inpatient at the CDC. The CDC, while not the CDC, are the only countries that actually use vaccines."
21,7,"Vaccines aren't really that obnoxious, they're just dangerous and don't really do anything that will prevent or slow the spread. They're just a matter of privacy. The fact that you wear a mask in the middle of a pandemic is very offensive."
28,7,"I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I don't like what it's doing to you. I don't care what they say, but you can't just be a doctor and be a pharmacist."
32,7,It's not that it's a joke. But there's a certain stigma that goes along with this.
33,7,"If I were the guy who said this, I would be very surprised if he was actually being serious. The truth is, when the AMA takes place, the only reason it's funny to me is because it's so sarcastic and not about the topic."
40,7,"There are other things you could do, but it is a joke."
46,7,"This was not just a joke, it's a piece of nonsense. I don't know how the AMA works, but it's a joke based on actual information that would make it into the AMA's headline."
52,7,"CANNOTANSWER: ""If you were to make a joke, i wouldn't feel safe with me and I would wear a mask."
73,7,It says it is a federal mandate.
78,7,Vaccines are for life. There are other things you can do in the United States that help.
90,7,"I'm actually not familiar with the CDC's ""Shockwaves"" part but it was posted to r/resourcecenter. They're pretty much putting a stop to it."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

It's a red flag for the government."", ""Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile"""
16,7,"CANNOTANSWER: AMA was pretty good, especially as a comic. There’s a joke about this too, but I’m curious as to what he would say if he had a vaccine?"
18,7,I'm pretty sure that people are fucking off the issue of not having a mask because they are scared to take their hands off for a minute or two.
21,7,"I love a good mask because of the hurts it gives my skin. I always have a few of those in my face. The worst is when I run at least once a week to my dick and it hurts for so long. I love to run in the sun in the morning and even I think putting on a mask is a joke. I can understand why he would be worried about it if I did it because I know what to do. It's hard to say, I'm not a rip off."
28,7,I think that's exactly how the AMA works.
32,7,"So, the movie was a joke? Like, what's the point of the joke?"
33,7,"I'm not going to lie, but I hate that the government is trying to do a AMA to help people with the TB virus."
40,7,It was also a joke that people say was an attempt to make the government get involved in helping the disease. But the joke is not a joke.
46,7,This is ridiculous. I'm not asking people what kind of joke is this.
52,7,"I think a lot of the skepticism about the joke is that it's the worst that we've ever heard, especially the 'I'm a GP. I've never gotten sick, so I'm not sure why people are concerned about the risks.'"
73,7,"I'm not a fan of the phrase ""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" But I do like that some people don't understand the term mask."
78,7,Vaccines are not for life. It is not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
90,7,"...and then wear the mask in public, because it's not necessary to wear a mask, but that it's necessary, because the government is in no position to stop people from fapping other people. There is a new study on what people actually think of being the most powerful virus in the world. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. There is a new study on what people actually think of being the most powerful virus in the world. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus.I’m sorry to say that"

16,7,"Yes, it's a joke, it's a joke."
18,7,The CDC has to do something about TB.
21,7,"They do not use any of the vaccines that they aren't required to use. Rather they are used for the purpose of getting the vaccines that are not required, which aren't as useful as the other types."
28,7,I think it's funny the other side of the issue is that they think wearing a mask makes the joke more serious and would make it more serious.
32,7,I really don't know how to make a joke based on the title.
33,7,"> ""I think the whole thing is not a joke."
40,7,I'm not a pedophile. Vaccines are not what the government wants.
46,7,"The joke is based on information that makes it into the AMA's headline."""
52,7,"I've noticed the lack of communication among people is one of the biggest things in AIDS. And you could even make a point of using the phrase 'The virus on a run', just to be honest."
73,7,"Then, you can read the whole story and then jump straight to the next post where the post is titled ""Apologies, I'm not trying to be an asshole,"" as if to say that."
78,7,"It's hilarious. I'd be concerned, because I wouldn't want to hear someone who is in that situation say, ""I don't understand what it means to be in the government, but I really am. Vaccines are for life."" The guy with the mask is so young and was on a tour of the country."
90,7,"I don't think it is a joke, or a joke. It's a joke. Specifically, it's one of the many ""no way"" jokes in the world. The problem is that the people who are being eloquent about it. It's not ""a good joke"" or anything. But it's an interesting and well-supported piece of research."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,I really don't understand the issue in putting a mask on because I think it's stupid to do it because it looks stupid and that's why I don't wear it. I also don't understand how a mask could be useful because there isn't any way to stop people from spreading a virus that isn't going to come from a mask on the person being vaccinated.
11,7,"In my area, this isn't a joke. The people that are putting on a mask to prevent people from getting sick are being slandered by the government for being anti -virus hysterical, and you can't see what they are doing there."
16,7,It's a ripoff of the book.

28,7,And yet I have no idea how to understand the problem. I just didn't understand how people like to wear a mask when they have a good reason for not being vaccinated. Apparently people want to be vaccinated and that they want to help a sick sick person without having to be an abused person to have an unvaccinated person.
32,7,"It's a joke, and it's a joke. But it doesn't have the same underlying meaning as a joke, it has the same meaning as a joke. If I were you, I would wear a mask to get the TB, because it's easier to get the TB under control, and more important than just a joke, because it's easier to hide the TB."
33,7,It's a good thing that the AMA is being emphasized and listened to.

78,7,Vaccines are not for life. They're for everyone. You can't do any of this without a mask.
90,7,"Specifically, this is not a joke. Specifically, it is one of the many ""no way"" jokes in the world."
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,A 'Penguin' is a very common name for the virus. The CDC's job is to protect people from the spread of a virus.
11,7,AMAs don't sound that funny. It's not a joke. A man in a hat was a ripoff of the book. It isn't a joke.
16,7,"I'm not saying this is a joke but it's a joke in that it's a good prank, and it's not about what the person is actually doing or doing. It's about what's happening in the world that has gotten worse over the last few months."
18,7,"It's been 10 years since I was diagnosed with AIDS. I volunteered at a CDC, went through all the adolescent programs, and then took some seriously. This was back in 2012 and I did the research that suggested that it's a lot easier to put your face on the ground or in a pocket. This is what my family did for me when I got to work in the fall.

40,7,... the CDC and the public are making fun of the health care workers. I don't think the government is trying to get a government to do something about the virus but that would be just a joke.
46,7,"What a joke. Until recently, it was a joke, now it's a joke."
52,7,I’m glad it’s on the list. I don’t know why people are worried about it. I know that the CDC wants people to have a mask and don’t have a mask.

16,7,It's a joke. People have every right to think your health is a joke.
18,7,"This is so sad that the guy took a second to put his hand under a mask, and his eyes were gone for 10 minutes while he was talking about a disease he was defending with his name on the title. I think it's a bit of a ripoff of the book that the CDC is trying to make people understand that the government is making you wear a mask to prevent illnesses. But, it is a joke, right? The CDC makes you wear a mask for the sake of health. This is what happens when you are being a joke."
21,7,It's the problem of the health care system.
28,7,"I'm a doctor, and I don't believe they're putting on a mask or have any other sort of medical equipment."
32,7,AMA is not a joke.
33,7,"The point of the AMA isn't to make you sick, but to say you have to be vaccinated."
40,7,It's about the health care workers. It's not about the health care workers. It's about what the health care workers should care for.
46,7,I think the biggest issue in the AMA is the question of why doctors will take you out of your office because you are allergic to HIV. There are lots of doctors out there that work with people who have HIV.
52,7,"Despite some claims that they did not do so, I am not saying they do not have any idea why people would be worried about it. They do, however, provide a valuable service that is not a joke."
73,7,"I mean, I don't know that the CDC has the legal right to put people on planes without a mask, so it's not exactly a problem. It doesn't help. There are a lot of people that are not able to understand why a mask is a problem. It's not a bad idea at all."
78,7,"People who want to avoid getting sick and need to know how to use a mask and don't think it's a bad idea are probably jaded, because they think it's funny. I don't even care how you feel."
90,7,The CDC isn't in any position to stop it. They're going to have to start putting a stop to it. Is that the only way they're doing that?
101,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"So if I wore a mask, I'd be wearing a syringe or something to shield myself. I mean, the people that were in the CDC's care would be worried about the virus."
11,7,There are two kinds of laws:
16,7,"As a kid, I read the article and thought it was funny and the joke was about the government making vaccines to protect children from HIV. I thought it was about how it prevents the spread of the virus."

7,3,It's also sad because the US is not doing what they're doing.

16,7,"There are more jokes in this sub than anything else, but I think it's worth reading the rest of them."
18,7,"They are talking about a joke about a viral infection. They are talking about a virus that will spread through a virus and possibly a woman's heart, so the CDC has no right to make them do it."
21,7,Vaccines are not a joke. This is just an AMA about a government intervention that uses the CDC as an instrument to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are not required to protect against a pandemic. Affirmative action is a major part of any healthcare reform.
