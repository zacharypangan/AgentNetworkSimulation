98,97,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,23,My neighbor and I went into the grocery store that morning and the only person we talked to came from the other side. It was a bit of a weird place.
97,27,"Oh hey, you are a free gent. i am not just kidding :)"
97,30,Taking a mask off as I walk around with a bare lip is a bad idea.
97,35,"I was in a similar situation while at the grocery store where a kid saw me. He walked up to me to say, ""oh yea, I am a girl."" He looked like a really attractive guy. I was the first to see the lady he was at."
97,36,"i m wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it"
97,49,I was a little bit uncomfortable when I was a kid. My mother always swore that I wouldn't wear my mask because I'm old. When I was a kid she still was afraid to wear a mask.
97,57,"if you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,65,I do this at the grocery store.
97,66,What's your favorite kind of black dress?
97,69,That was a good movie  I would love to see the movies about it

98,97,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

97,23,">Oh hey, you are a free gent. i am not just kidding :) Taking a mask off as i just walk around with a bare lip is a bad idea."
97,27,"I think that if he went into the grocery store and you took a mask off you would say to yourself ""hmm, i don't know what to do with my bare lip."" Probably because he didn't look at you. It would be interesting if you showed up with your face in front of him and he saw you. That's how you look."
97,30,The first time I saw him was in a grocery store.
97,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,36,That is why I think it is useful to wear a mask to stop a virus. It helps the public know what's going on in the world.
97,49,I am going to give you a ring today! I don't think I've ever been able to stop myself. The virus has only been there for about one month now. And I'm going to go and buy a mask if I am sick. If I don't I won't be able to stop the virus.
97,57,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,65,You are a prick :)
97,66,I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban.
97,69,I am so glad we all have a place to look to for some kind of a mask.
97,90,"This is an awful lot of nonsense. We're talking about what’s being reported by other people, not what’s being said. There is no actual data to support the idea that you may have a virus and should get yourself a mask. And there is also no real data to support the notion that wearing a mask is an unnecessary act of government inflicted on the public."
98,97,It was a joke for years.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,23,I'm going to give you a ring today! I am so glad we all have a place to look to for some kind of a mask.
97,27,The most annoying thing about the government being on our side is that we can't wear a mask. We have a better chance at stopping an outbreak than a person with a disease.
97,30,">I think that if he went into the grocery store and you took a mask off you would say to yourself ""hmm, i don't know what to do with my bare lip."" Probably because he didn't look at you.

97,36,A prick with no idea what a prick is. I mean I'd like to have one. But it's not a very good idea. People have to see if they're going to be able to stop themselves because they don't.
97,49,Is there something that is a lie?
97,57,"i know what you mean i'm a bit of a troll. i've never been a fan of the turban, though i'm sure i would be able to stop the spread of a virus"
97,65,I think wearing a mask to stop a virus is very effective.
97,66,Well i've already mentioned i have a virus and I've been using a mask for several years
97,69,Why wouldn't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus? I think you can do it if you're a person.
97,90,I was just about to put in a note about wearing a mask after my friend started running into the store on the saturday. I think she was being very kind to me and took it out of her purse.
98,97,"> I love wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection, but it's useless and I hate it."
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,23,That's how I look at it.
97,27,I think wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection is very effective. I mean I've been using a mask for several years Why wouldn't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus? I think you can do it if you're a person.

97,35,"So, if there is a virus or a virus spreads, then I would wear a mask? I like to wear a mask to prevent things like this."
97,36,"I just don't understand what you mean if someone is attempting to imply the government's actions will stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. You are a prick :) I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban."
97,49,The wikipedia article says that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is an unnecessary act of government inflicted on the public.
97,57,A bit of a troll is a troll in and of itself.
97,65,I’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted for this. Those were a lot of shit.
97,66,I was about to take a note about wearing a mask after my friend started running into the store on the saturday. I think she was being very kind to me and took it out of her purse. I think it's not a very good idea. People have to see if they're going to be able to stop themselves because they don't.
97,69,I'm pretty sure they don't like the idea that a man that is wearing a mask can help stop the spread of a virus.
97,90,if you want to stop the spread of a virus - you don't have to stop the spread of the virus
98,97,"I mean, the joke is to stop a virus or a bad one. And I think it isn't that funny. People don't wear a mask because it doesn't have any impact on the virus or their environment."
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,23,"I don't think there are much more reasons for people to wear a mask than other people who might, but this is one of the more disturbing ones. People think wearing a mask to prevent a virus is good, but I think it's a good idea to wear a mask to prevent it, because it helps them avoid getting infected."
97,27,"> So, if there is a virus or a virus spreads, then I would wear a mask?"
97,30,... you are a prick in and of itself.
97,35,What I did was to stop it from spreading. I wasn't being a bit of a troll
97,36,"This is a wiki article. It's all just that we don't use turbans, we just wear turbans when the public gets sick and then we wear hats when they're sick."

97,66,"> I love wearing a mask to prevent a virus, but it's useless and I hate it."
97,69,I wore a mask once and it was so disgusting. It was so disgusting. It made me want to wear a mask.
97,90,"Why do they even do it? I think you should wear one. It's not a joke, but just a way to get a message across quickly."
98,97,"In fact, in some places the joke doesn't even apply. It's a form of protection. Is it a joke?"
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

97,30,> I believe it's a good idea to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus.

97,49,"I didn't want to say that. I mean a guy I knew wore a mask, and it got him sick and I'd go to work and put on some masks."

97,65,"Wearing a mask doesn't help stop a virus, or even prevent it. It's a way to get a message across quickly. In fact, in some places the joke doesn't even apply. It's a form of protection. Is it a joke?"
97,66,"I'm a very troll who uses turbans for all sorts of purposes and turbans are the bare minimum of protection. I am a really good person and wear hats. I love wearing a mask to stop my neighbors from getting infected and that can prevent them from sneezing. I've seen a lot of things like this happening to me too, and I'm not surprised turbans are common in other countries."
97,69,I like how that makes people feel. I think the joke was a bit over the top. I think people should wear masks to stop a virus and that it helps them stop the spread. It makes a lot of people feel bad.
97,90,I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,97,"YMMV. It seems like your husband is trying to make you laugh, but I don't think he does."
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

97,65,"CANNOTANSWER, but I think it was pretty silly to suggest a joke like this."
97,66,Why should we take that back to the CDC? Because we do not have any real idea how people would react when people say it and it's all that matters. It's really just not funny.
