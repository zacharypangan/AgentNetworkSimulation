88,68,I don't understand why a joke is made about a doctor's inability to stop a virus spreading on a patient's body. They have done things that nobody actually cares about and have been told about. It's a joke.
90,68,"[NAME]: My dad once told me ""It is funny that you can wear a mask and not be a dick"". He went on to say that I was a dick and that he was a dick."
95,68,[NAME] from the New York Times.
98,68,"I can tell you that the guy's a dick, you know he didn't actually tell you that he wore a mask to protect himself from HIV."
99,68,I don't see how it makes any sense to have a person wearing a mask in the parade because it's hilarious. It's the same way a clown does. It's not a joke.
68,9,"In the AMA: ""It is funny that you can wear a mask and not be a dick"""
68,14,I'm not sure if I understand you but the idea of a AMA about a government invading people is a bit fucked up if you're not the victim of the AMA. You're describing a rabid fan of the government.
68,19,The whole thing sounds like a joke...
68,34,I feel like this is all about the joke.
68,35,"i can tell you that the guy's a dick, you know he didn't actually tell you that he wore a mask to protect himself from HIV. It's the same way a clown does. It's not a joke."
68,36,"My husband and I went to see the AMA. We were told we had to wear masks and they did not have a reason to wear them, so we stopped us from wearing them. We stopped because a doctor told us we were being lied to by an unnamed, non-government employee. We stopped because he wasn't. We had no reason to do it and when we left, he was told that he needed to wear a mask to protect himself. I guess it was his mistake and he forgot it afterward."
68,60,"It sounds like the government has an idea that it is a joke, but it really makes no sense because the government has nothing to do with preventing the spread of a virus."
79,68,CANNOTANSWER FACT: Keeping a mask is a great way to stop AIDS/HIV.
87,68,"This is a real-life, real life problem. How the U.S. government treats vaccines is a question."
88,68,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
90,68,"I'm a person and I have a mask, I don't wear one."
95,68,"There's a lukewarm, jimmy lee and the troll are really not the right people."
98,68,People who wear masks aren't allowed to say they don't like them. But they should be encouraged to.
99,68,I've read this several times. There are very interesting stories about people who have been in the position of wearing masks.
68,9,This is actually the best AMA I've read.
68,14,"Yes, it's a joke."
68,19,"I'm a public health expert, and I've come across people who wear masks or don't wear them or do the same type of masks they use to protect people. The joke is a joke."
68,34,AMAs - the snide ones.
68,35,"""It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."""
68,36,It's a joke.
68,60,The AMA I see is the only way for anyone to know why this isn't a joke. It's a really bad one. The AMA I find funny in a lot of ways. If you read the article the AMA is misleading.
79,68,"I think it's more about the people who don't wear masks, who aren't going to do anything about it to help others and can't afford to have a job as a caregiver or to pay for a new health insurance."
87,68,"This is a real-life, real life problem. How the U.S. government treats vaccines is a question."
88,68,Vaccines are legal because they prevent the spread of HIV - and that's one of the many reasons the government is trying to stop it.
90,68,"You say that, but it's not a joke."
95,68,"The best way to say a joke is to make sure that it's not just a joke, but a way of saying it, and not a way of making it a joke, is to make it so it makes no sense for people to say it."
98,68,"I think the whole thing was a joke, but it was a good one. The fact that the guy was talking about a mask while he was a stranger is really interesting and makes the whole thing seem like an issue. It isn't a joke, but it's just not a joke. It is a joke."
99,68,It doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,9,No. That is one joke. It is a joke.
68,14,"AMA, what? I read it twice..."
68,19,"I've seen many AMAs and all of them are pretty entertaining and sometimes entertaining, but sometimes you just have to accept the fact that they're so much more funny. I don't know how you would ever like to think of an AMA if you didn't like them. But it doesn't have to be."
68,34,This is a joke and I think the AMAs are hilarious.
68,35,"I'm a CDC administrator, I have a full list of articles that have been authored by those guys and are in support of the public health efforts of the government."
68,36,People who wear masks aren't allowed to say they don't like them. But they should be encouraged to.
68,60,"My mother and a friend of mine both have a job as a doctor. If you have kids and you aren't vaccinated, a doctor will give you a medical certificate. Getting vaccinated will make you sick and it will prevent you from dying of the disease and it will prevent you from dying of it. So if you wear a mask, you are a patriot."
79,68,Keeping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,68,"I'm a little confused about what to say, and I feel like the first person to respond is completely right."
88,68,I'm sorry but people are being blatantly naive about this.
90,68,I know some folks who wear masks because it's a joke. I know that some people wear them for the very same reason they would not fap themselves. You don't fuck up people because they want to see you.
95,68,"The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not just a joke because it's a way of saying it, and not a way of making it a joke, is to make it so it makes no sense for people to say it."
98,68,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
99,68,People don't wear masks because the doctor who explains how to wear a mask tells you something is wrong. They are using a mask to stop the spread of the virus. You don't have to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. You have to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
68,9,Why does the government need to impose its own mandate on them?
68,14,A rape joke is not a joke. It's a joke.
68,19,"It's a joke unless it is in a way that is humorous, so it's not a joke. It's a joke. AMAs are often sarcastic and they are also extremely stupid. It's a funny way of saying something like ""I don't want to be a patriot."""
68,34,"AMAs are not jokes, they are AMAs. AMAs are about how the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
68,35,"""It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."" ""I like to say the whole joke thing isn't a joke. It's a joke."" ""It's a joke."" ""I've seen many movies and it's awesome. I think it was a great thing that someone made such a good joke."", ""I can tell you that the guy's a dick, you know he wore a mask to prevent the spread of HIV."
68,36,People who wear masks aren't allowed to say they don't like them. But they should be encouraged to.
68,60,It is a joke. You are a patriot.
79,68,Is there any difference between the CDC and the state gov't?
87,68,"I'm not sure how that's a good idea. It's a joke, but it's the best possible idea."
88,68,The government is trying to get people out of the health care system. This is why it's so silly.
90,68,"A ""Masked by the Devil"" type joke can be used to promote sexual relationships. I like this one because it is hilarious. I don't think that I'm the only one who uses it and I'm in a very serious situation."
95,68,"They need to change the name of a joke so that everyone who cares about vaccination knows what's going on. It's a joke to keep people from taking the vaccine in the future, because they don't feel the need to use it."
98,68,I think the fact that the guy was talking about a mask while he was a stranger is really interesting and makes the whole thing seem like an issue.
99,68,I'm going to have to go read that...
68,9,It's actually a joke. It's funny because a dick that you don't know is sick. You don't know why you're sick. It's a joke.
68,14,"I've heard about these being marketed as something for the private sector because of the prevalence of HIV. AMAs have become the norm here, but I'm not sure what it is. I think it's just a joke to the government that you can't just ""stuff"" it up."
68,19,"People don't wear masks because it makes people uncomfortable, because it prevents the spread of a virus."
68,34,I think the best way to explain it is to 'help out' with the people that are trying to get them out of the health care system.
68,35,"No, it's not a joke."
68,36,"I'm a patriot, but I do have one thing in common with people in my family, and I think the joke is very important."
68,60,I think it's pretty obvious the government is trying to be a joke because the AMAs are very interesting and humorous.
79,68,"""... but I want to tell you that if I do not get a mask mandate, I don't get to put on a mask."
87,68,"In the UK, vaccines are a voluntary process that prevents people from inhaling and transmitting a virus. Generally, a vaccine is not needed."
88,68,Vaccines are legal because they prevent the spread of HIV. And that's one of the many reasons the government is trying to stop it.
90,68,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,68,"That's a pretty long list of jokes I've read about people who can't actually get vaccinated, and people who can't get the vaccine are often referred to as 'jimmies' (short for people who think it's a joke). I read the article the other day, and it's really funny. I've read it and it's pretty clear to me that this is a joke that's about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus and how a joke works and how it works. I"
98,68,Wearing a mask because you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows isn't a joke.
99,68,I like to think of a lot of movies that use cloners to disguise the cyborg shitjob. They are so funny that people will find their clones'so sick. '' They are not a good idea because they are just as dangerous and will spread it. They are just so cool and weird that they're just being silly.
68,9,"It's funny because people don't know what a dick is, because he's getting sick and can't tell who a dick is. That's a joke."
68,14,The issue is a combination of political correctness and gender. One might say the joke is about a rape joke. The other might say the joke is about a politician in power vs. a government official.
68,19,What's funny is that we have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of the virus.
68,34,"I love the one where the guy says ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
68,35,"I have a copy of the AMA, but I can't find the link."
68,36,"Is the joke a joke or not? The article was a joke, and I think it's not the only one."
68,60,">It's a joke, but it really makes no sense because the government has nothing to do with preventing the spread of a virus."
79,68,"I think the first part of the joke is that there's a problem with the CDC trying to prevent HIV from spreading. There's a problem with the government trying to get people to stop using a mask in order to fuck with the CDC, but the CDC has not found a solution. That's a shame, because the CDC has to stop it and that's one of the reasons that the joke is still a joke, and it's a joke in that its about prevent the spread of AIDS to go on a lot of people to do"
87,68,AMA's can be done on any day. The public health official is the one who decides to provide the vaccine in a way that protects the public and is not about saving the lives of people who haven't been vaccinated.
88,68,"""This is a joke that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
90,68,"I am so sorry to hear that you are being downvoted, but I have been given this kind of response by a friend of mine. They're going to try to fuck these people and get the public to wear masks too."
95,68,> We are trying to stop the spread of a virus.
98,68,"People who wear a mask can be pretty scared of anything. It's the most appropriate thing for everyone, and it doesn't just mean everyone wears it."
99,68,"This is exactly how the virus is being spread. I don't know if i will be able to put this out on an episode of TMNT yet, but I think the humor of it is still pretty cool."
68,9,"It's a joke because the government has no vested interest in preventing the spread of a virus, and people can't have a joke about having a face mask to mask the fact that people can't get a vaccine. The government will go out and do it and people will just laugh."
68,14,"Those AMAs sound a lot like the ones I read in the book, I've been following all of it for a few weeks now. Mostly because it's about the health problem and people trying to make their health care more important."
68,19,I would get over it. I haven't heard of the AMA. It's like a joke with some jokes.
68,34,People who don't know what a dick is.
68,35,I can't believe how many people who see these jokes are still talking about the government.
68,36,"A great number of countries in the United States wear masks every year to prevent infections of the AIDS epidemic. AMA's, by definition, aren't all about preventive vaccinations, but instead, they're all about preventing that. Honestly, the only way to stop them from spreading is to make sure people are aware of how much they can get a vaccine before they die. I'm pretty sure that people would not care what the actual actual vaccine costs, but a vaccination can do something pretty much anywhere in the future."
68,60,I think this AMA is about a man being referred to as 'jimmies' (short for people who think it's a joke).
79,68,"Well, if that's a joke, you know what else to say."
87,68,Why is it not a joke? Because it's an example of a joke that makes you laugh.
88,68,"What a lot of people are prone to being infected if they're wearing a mask in public - for example, people who run around the park in the morning with their hands on, people who don't wear it in the afternoon with their hands on."
90,68,I wear a mask because I'm afraid of it making people look like the shit they're infected with.
95,68,It's a joke because it's the government's only action. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's only action.

68,9,"I’m a bit skeptical about all of these AMAs, but I think the one about it is pretty funny and it’s the perfect example of a joke that makes people laugh. It’s not just about being silly."
68,14,If you want to get in on this kind of conversation: I'm the president of the United States.
68,19,I don't like this AMA. It's a joke. It's just a joke. It's a joke.
68,34,"Well, it's the government that's doing it. This is the government that's trying to stop the spread of a virus."
68,35,I read a AMA on this site and it has such a low response rate. It's not going to stop if the government wants to do something about it.
68,36,A lot of people who wear masks are infected by a virus. This AMA is about the government trying to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic.
68,60,"I don't know about this. I think it's funny, but I don't know why people like to think it's a joke, and instead of explaining it in the book, the AMAs are about people being out in the real world."
79,68,"This is one of those situations where you are told that while the government has no incentive to keep you in the hospital, you're not going to stay with them when they try and scare you out of an infection."
87,68,AMAs are good because they're done in a way that protects the public.
88,68,I'm not sure what's going on here? What is the meaning of 'to keep people from getting infected'?
90,68,"""Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
95,68,The joke that's going on is just that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,68,"Isn't that a'supposed"" thing? Isn't it actually a joke?"
99,68,This joke was made out of a very different subject.
68,9,"The AMA was originally going to be about the government helping prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic in the US. But the government really got a lot of push back, and now they're presenting this to the US media as a joke. I'm going to be in the same boat here."
68,14,I'm confused by the whole 'How are we not getting a good chance at vaccination in America?' thing.
68,19,You read the whole thread and found out that the AMA is a joke. It's not that the AMA is a joke but that the AMA is a joke.
68,34,"I was trying to look at the name of a good movie I was reading, and it seemed to me like someone in the book had no idea what the title meant."
68,35,I don't understand how the AMA doesn't seem like a legitimate explanation.
68,36,Is it a joke that people are told that people are more likely to get vaccinated?

79,68,"Having to wear a mask can actually be a fucking nightmare, no matter what you say, if you want to keep that kind of behavior."
87,68,It's an example of a joke that makes you laugh.

68,9,"So if the government isn't doing the right thing, it's just a joke. You're a joke, if the government isn't doing anything, then it's a joke?"
68,14,"No, not really. I had to go through it for a few months, and I still haven't seen anything in a few months."

68,60,I do not think people realize that they're in the US. They were actually able to make a point of the AMA.
79,68,CANNOTANSWER FACT: Keeping a mask is a great way to stop AIDS/HIV.
87,68,I agree. This is not a joke about being a woman whose baby isn't getting the vaccine. It's about protecting people. I'm pretty sure they were talking about the health of their child.
88,68,"[What I'm saying is that a lot of people are prone to being infected if they're wearing a mask in public - for example, people who run around the park in the morning with their hands on, people who don't wear it in the afternoon with their hands on.'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt/Pages/Miracles/index.htm).

90,68,"I think the best thing people can do is wear a mask because it can stop the spread of a virus. It isn't a joke. It means you need a mask on to prevent a virus from spreading, and they are supposed to put it on so you can not be exposed to it."

68,35,I just shivered reading that. I was so angry at you
68,36,I like to wear a mask when I can. I'm just trying to be kind to myself with my opinions.

88,68,This is one of the jokes made by the CDC.
90,68,"In one example, it is used to stop the spread of HIV. In another, it's used to prevent others from being exposed to HIV, but is not part of a prevention program."
95,68,I like this one. It’s been on the front page of the Daily Show and is a joke and a good one at that.
98,68,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
99,68,The joke is still hilarious and the morality of the joke isn't really that good.
68,9,"The CDC has the right to change the law and its mandate. The government needs to stop spreading it to people in other countries, not just in the US. And, yes, it's funny."
68,14,"I was able to find the first two references in the article, and if I was, it seemed like it was about a government policy. It was an interesting comparison to a joke."
68,19,AMAs are just jokes. I think the best joke of all time was the one that he was the first to say the joke. Then I remembered a couple of the jokes he gave me.

68,60,'I like that guy is wearing his welder's mask he could have just said i forgot it when he didn't have a face mask but instead he put others first you know what you call a person like that 'patriot' and you have to put the mask on.''
79,68,I think he is correct that the whole point of a mask mandate is to prevent a certain amount of people from getting AIDS/HIV. The CDC is just trying to stop that from happening.
87,68,"A lot of people are blaming the AMA on some kind of illness that may not be preventable. The joke might be intended to be a racial joke, but that's not something a joke is supposed to be."
88,68,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV and is trying to make a joke about how to prevent a virus from spreading in people.
90,68,It can't be done. It's just a joke.
95,68,"It doesn't really say how much of a joke they are trying to prevent it, so it has little to do with what's said. It says a little bit about that. I just can't figure out why it makes the most sense to say it to people, and it just shows the extent of the joke that we are trying to stop the spread of a virus. It says more about that the Government is trying to stop it. It's not just the government. It's the government. And if it's not working, it's more about this."
98,68,"I'm not sure it's a joke, but I would think a joke is funny, since if a comment has a lot of sexism, a joke isn't a joke."
99,68,It's a joke because you don't want to do it.
68,9,The joke was about the government's attempts to prevent the spread of HIV and is based off of a few years of a conversation.
68,14,Is there an option to be a person who wears a mask to protect themselves while vaccinated? Because it isn't that simple and it is not really something people do for the general public.
68,19,"""It doesn't really say how much of a joke they are trying to prevent the spread of the virus. It's not just the government. It's the government. And if it's not working, it's more about this.

68,35,There are dozens of examples that can be summarized as such:

68,60,"This is the joke, not the joke."

87,68,The article doesn't provide much information. You have the choice to choose the AMA that is being put up in a place that is naive to the point that AMAs aren't really about preventing the spread of the virus.
88,68,"In the United States, they have more than twice the health-aware population of the United States. In fact, there are more than 150,000 people on the US population (11 million of whom don't have a diagnosis). The CDC has been working hard to change that."
90,68,"Probably a joke, but at least it is in the sense that it's meant to prevent the spread of the disease."
95,68,The joke is that people who think it's a joke don't actually believe it.
98,68,There are also two types of jokes:
99,68,"What’s that, a lot of the people in the comments didn’t mean this."
68,9,"The government has to make it more realistic. If you like a joke, it isn't a joke. The government isn't helping people with their health."
68,14,"You can't wear a mask when you have a virus. It's only part of the vaccination protocol. It's not a joke, it's a joke, and it's not a joke. 'I think it's a joke because i don't get it.'"
68,19,"A popular AMA on Twitter, with a lot of people calling it ''a joke'' and ""what's funny is that we have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of the virus."

68,35,AMAs have been around since the 90s.
68,36,"There's a joke about the government not wanting to do it for health reasons, and it's a joke that the government wants to do."
68,60,I'm so confused - how many people are going to actually understand how the joke is being made?...
79,68,People who don't want to get a mask can't stop a virus because there's a huge problem in their own country.

A joke about a prank about the government trying to stop the spread of the virus. A joke about a joke about a government trying to stop the spread of the virus."
95,68,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's the government's only action.

68,9,I would say that it's a joke because the CDC isn't doing anything for it's own good.

68,35,I think the people who dread AMAs are the ones who are most critical of the government.

87,68,"Yes, AMAs have a long history of causing problems, especially in those countries with such a large population. Vaccines have been banned by the FDA for many years. AMAs are being banned in the states where they are not required."
88,68,Vaccines are legal because they prevent the spread of HIV.
90,68,"As someone who runs for the government, I am going to add that there are lots of jokes. I mean, I think the first is that you don't get a joke. The second is that it means something other than being a dick. The third is that you're a joke."
95,68,And yet the joke is still a joke.

90,68,"I think the best way to prevent spreading the virus is by wearing a mask. It is a joke. The government has a mandate, which is to not wear a mask in public places, but to wear a mask in public and not to fap themselves. So people do it to fap themselves."

68,14,"I like the fact that you didn't even see the first paragraph. The AMA isn't a joke, it's a joke. I do, however, see how this is a 'judgement of a joke'. The AMA is an attempt to minimize some of the sexist jokes around it."
68,19,"The point of the AMA is to point out that it is actually a joke, that you need to read it and see why."
68,34,"So how did you get to that part? Because, ah, yeah, I've been here before. EDIT: So, I am also not sure what is a joke."
