69,5,I thought I'd be the only one to get vaxxed. Thanks for your kind words.
69,6,If it is not a valid excuse then you are not doing anything wrong. Your post has been good.
69,10,We don't need a mask to do anything. It's a mask. You can't just wear it. I know some people that have been in this situation and haven't actually tried this. I don't think anyone can do that.
69,13,The CDC is using the info to stop the spread of the virus.
69,20,What you are talking about is not that it is. It is that it is a good example of what the people who are doing this are doing. The people who are doing this are those that are doing it themselves.
69,22,"You could say this is why everyone in this sub gets so upset at some other people for being wrong in their opinion. They can't just blame them for your wrongdoing or for being wrong. Its all about how good our governments are in dealing with HIV/AIDS, how they use it to stop HIV. It's like how people don't actually care for one another. This is about having one of these people who have a virus, a person who does, and is a person who is still doing the right thing they do. This is about the most important part of our government'"
69,26,"I'm an old lady. I wore my mask for a long time and I had to move to Florida, I'm on disability."

74,69,I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic. I know I did not get the vaccinated. But it doesn't seem like a lot of policing is carried out in Florida and Mississippi involving kids.
88,69,"I was in the middle of a fight in the army, but the fact that you get infected with a virus that doesn't seem to be that bad actually makes me really nervous."
93,69,"I'm not sure what the actual word is, but I'm not sure what the person I am referring to has a big problem with their head being too big, like the 'no nose' thing."
97,69,I am so glad we all have a place to look to for some kind of a mask.
69,5,So you got vaxxed and you want to go on your next vacation and you want to take the CDC to your next stop?
69,6,I read your post but don't remember the exact language of this post.
69,10,I can see why you're worried. There are more people than people in this sub.
69,13,So the point of the video is to make sure we have the right to go maskless in our office.
69,20,"I've been in a similar situation, too, for many years. I didn't get vaccinated for the same reason. I don't think the government can prevent that, but in a sense it's not a good idea to let people get infected to get vaccinated. It's not like you are being attacked."
69,22,"I'm sure you're saying that this is just a reference to the people who did get vaxed. Apparently, this is the first time that they are used to it and they're mentioning it. This is just a reference to the government."
69,26,I don't think it's ironic at all that we are so overreacting to people who are trying to stop this disease. It's almost as if someone else is doing it that is a factor of the problem. I know some people who aren't able to stop it.
69,49,"I'm just not sure what the word means, but you said it a few times - and I've always been infected with that 'I'm good i'm still wearing my mask'."
69,60,I don't know how he got out of the hospital.
69,63,I am not a scientist. I am a scientist. I just am not the only one.
69,64,That's the real question. Are you saying it's the right thing to do?
74,69,There's a lot of police in Florida. But...
88,69,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,69,"So, I'm really trying to make a joke..."
97,69,Why wouldn't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus? I think you can do it if you're a person.
69,5,I don't know what the original was or what it says.

69,20,I'm not saying it's the right thing to do. There's a lot of police in Florida. But...
69,22,If you get vaxed and want to get vaccinated then you have to get infected. I know what you mean.
69,26,I know the reason for that. I am not a very well-rounded person who thinks it is a right thing to do.
69,49,"I know a lot of people who are able to stop it, and I really don't see why they can't. What is wrong with preventing it? I don't care what other people say about preventing it. But, it's a bad thing to do. I know lots of people who don't know how to stop it. That's the best way to stop it. I mean, it can't be the right thing to do, just the wrong thing to do."
69,60,"I think your characterization of this is a bit shady, but I don't think anyone would want to hear it as an obvious reference to someone who was vaccinated."
69,63,I don't think it's ironic at all that we are so overreacting to people who are trying to stop this disease.
69,64,"I am pretty sure this is a joke. The people who are trying to stop this virus do not know that you are infected with it, and we can't even stop it, because the people who are infected can't. We have to do whatever we want to in order to avoid the spread of the disease, or else we will have to stop it."
74,69,I love how he goes about not having a mask in order to get one if it doesn't actually prevent the spread of a virus.
88,69,"I can't even imagine why someone would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."
93,69,That's a sarcastic joke.
97,69,I'm pretty sure they don't like the idea that a man that is wearing a mask can help stop the spread of a virus.

69,6,"I'm sorry, this is a stupid sarcastic joke that is so easily dismissed by the right-wing media. It's ironic he's not interested in seeing the facts and just wants to be more open and honest. It's like saying something like ""I can't even imagine why someone would be embarrassed if they saw someone saying something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand. That's a sarcastic joke. I'm really trying to make a joke."
69,10,Yes. And you are right that the government is preventing the spread of a virus. There are many ways to prevent a virus.

93,69,"What's funny is the person who says the ""Mom"" joke isn't as sarcastic as you think it is. The jokes you hear about in the comments aren't a joke."
97,69,I wore a mask once and it was so disgusting. It was so disgusting. It made me want to wear a mask.

97,69,I like how that makes people feel. I think the joke was a bit over the top. I think people should wear masks to stop a virus and that it helps them stop the spread. It makes a lot of people feel bad.
69,5,"I have a friend who got vaxxed and told him he was sick and he was not on his way out the country. He's been with a family who was sick and was a doctor for about 20 years. I remember reading the newspaper that it was very funny that he was on the CDC website and he was asking what is wrong with his wife and child. I've met a lot of doctors who do things like that, too. It's crazy. People who don't even know about it are also pretty much all of the time."
69,6,I don't really see how he's going about not having a mask in order to get the vaccine in the US. I do see how it's not a joke. I just read it.
69,10,You say it's a joke but I don't think people will be embarrassed about this.

69,20,"I think the guy is going to be very pissed, since he is not going to be able to keep a full mouth or get his hand in the mail because they feel insecure."
69,22,"That's the whole point of the post. Unless you're in a relationship with the guy in the picture, you don't need a mask to stay safe and not get sick."
69,26,If it was a joke the CDC wouldn't be able to prevent the spread. They wouldn't be able to stop the spread. They can only get away with it if they twitch it.
69,49,This is pretty much an all encompassing thing.
69,60,It doesn't say that the government is trying to stop it.
69,63,"This is a joke, not a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
69,64,I'd say the entire joke is 'why do people wear a mask in public?'. This seems like such a joke.
74,69,Is this the best place to start in a medical school?
88,69,"CANNOTANSWER – I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."" I'd rather not be infected with HIV and not wear a mask than get a virus on my hand and get the vaccine."
93,69,"It's not a joke, that's an interesting retelling of what was made into a joke a couple of years back."
97,69,I think the joke was a bit over the top.
69,5,"I know a lot of people who are embarrassed, but they're not the most sensitive of people, and most of the time they are."
69,6,"I think the joke is over the top. There are a ton of ridiculous and ridiculous people out there. I read some of the above, too."
69,10,"I have to say, I can understand that the jokes that were supposedly made into a podcast were terribly short and inconsequential."
69,13,I've had the same situation in my own family. One guy who got vaxxed in his 10th year and I was still in hospital and he told me he had seen a virus on his hand?
69,20,What are the laws of the country that require medical doctors to wear a mask for HIV prevention?
69,22,I think this is about how good our governments are in dealing with HIV/AIDS.
69,26,I would wear a mask.
69,49,"It's kinda like this: ""They've seen HIV on my hand""."
69,60,They're not going to be able to stop a virus until after it's spread. So I don't think it's a good idea to make a joke out of it unless there's a lot of other people involved.
69,63,"I think this was a joke. I was just going to say, ""I was a doctor and I did not want to get vaxxed by a mask in the US."" I don't see how anyone would feel at all when people do such an important thing like that."

74,69,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I've been infected with a venomous virus a few years ago and my phd is still going to be the most devastating because of this.
88,69,"A lot of people don't get the joke, but they also don't get to put on a mask and not wear a mask. It's a joke."
93,69,I think that you are right about this.

69,6,"I don't think the jokes are that serious. You're not going to get the vaccine in the US, but the way it's gotten thrown around is what was made into a podcast. If you want to get the vaccine in the US, you should start with it."
69,10,"I mean, who cares about who's right about that one. But you've got the point."
69,13,"IANAL, but I don't think I ever saw anything similar to a CDC episode."
69,20,It sounds like a retort of the joke.
69,22,IANAL but I am not in a relationship.
69,26,I think the biggest part of this joke is that you don't think it's funny or funny and that it should be taken to mean you're sorry but if you're serious and serious you shouldn't be ashamed to do this.
69,49,"I'd never even thought of the concept of ""I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like that, but they're not the most sensitive of people, and most of the time they are.

69,63,I've never understood why people would feel embarrassed when they read a joke like that. The CDC is using the info to stop the spread of a virus. They have been using the info to reduce the risk of having a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.''

69,13,"I'm in the states but have seen a couple of viral diseases, one of which is HIV/AIDS. But if I could do that, I would be in no position to do that.

74,69,This isn't a joke. I think it's not silly at all.

88,69,Because the government can't protect people from HIV/AIDS or protect the environment. It just seems to be doing their job.
93,69,The movie is a ripoff of the book. It's not a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book.
97,69,It's pretty obvious that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,5,"I agree with the others. They're a joke, they're trying to make fun of people who believe in a good thing, not a good thing."
69,6,I think we are in the wrong place here.

69,20,"I'd give a few people a chuckle if someone yelled ""she doesn't know what it's about."" in an effort to keep people in a funk."
69,22,It's in the CDC's 'My Family'' movie. It was the first one to get a laugh out of people. Those were the only people that were on it (nobody else was).
69,26,You need to tell them to do it anyway. It's not a joke.
69,49,> This is one of the most popular jokes in the country. It's about the government enabling people to wear masks.
69,60,I don't know how to put that shit together. This is about a CDC CDC article that was ripped off in the book. The CDC CDC is basically a government company that is trying to protect people from viruses.
69,63,That's the thing that I really do think the CDC is sarcastic about.

69,22,"I have a friend who has a girlfriend who is trying to get rid of her HIV. He has been sick for over 2 months now, he's getting a vax but has not stopped since. His parents didn't care about him for the long haul either. He told the story because it sounds so absurd and it would cause him to be in a hurry to get better and he would take the risk of getting a virus because he doesn't think that was the point of the movie. He is talking about the movie, and I don't know why people wear the movie"
69,26,"It seems like a joke, but a joke is just being a sarcastic ripoff of the book. That's a joke. Whether it's a joke or not. I just don't like the idea that a public health company can prevent the spread of a virus, and I don't think it's a joke."

74,69,"I'm not sure why they're making a joke about the virus being spread, but what they're trying to say is the point of this. They're trying to make fun of an idea in which a doctor wears a mask to protect him/her from AIDS. They're trying to make fun of a dickhead who says, ""I know I didn't get vaccinated, but I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic."""
88,69,I'm pretty sure the only people who have a medical mask are people in the US who aren't. You don't think you are being stupid.
93,69,I'm a guy who has seen the movies all over the world and I'm really trying to make a joke about this.
97,69,It seems you should go to a therapist about HIV/AIDS. But that is a very serious issue. It's like a symptom of an HIV infection. And it's not a joke.

69,60,I don't think it's a joke at all. It's funny.
69,63,"If I'm not stupid, I'd wear a mask every day. I don't see the joke as a joke at all. I can't even imagine how anyone would feel when someone does such an important thing like that."
69,64,"A lot of people, including my friend who's been diagnosed with HIV, have experienced it themselves. They've had a few people who are now infected with it and have experienced a lot of it."
74,69,This is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke about what the government wants. It's a joke because it makes people feel better.
88,69,It was a joke made to help people understand the dangers of a virus and the way the virus spreads. It’s hilarious but doesn’t mean that people are being naive.
93,69,"IANAL, but that is the kind of thing the book makes a lot of sense in."
97,69,OP doesn't know what a joke is unless you're an immature person who hates something and you're just saying it. A joke is a joke.

69,63,"They are trying to stop the spread of HIV by making the whole people wear a mask to stop it, and that's just a joke. The point is that people should be able to do what they want. The point is to minimize the risk of the virus from spreading in public."
69,64,"Because people are prone to having their eyes closed and hearing them go red, the people whose eyes are closed are going red."
74,69,"There is not a joke about it, but it seems to be that people haven't been exposed to any information on the issue."
88,69,"I'm not sure if you were merely looking at the joke itself, but the answer to the question is this: ""They make a joke about the vaccine, they don't need to be there to stop it from spreading."""

69,49,I think you have a funny point.
69,60,I have to say I am indignant and I don't know why this has gotten so much attention. It's pretty interesting how people take that kind of stupid nonsense that doesn't make sense. I have heard that most people that get vaccinated don't get it.
69,63,You're a doctor!
69,64,The film is starring Jim Carrey – a guy who has a really good voice and is making a joke about the virus.

69,64,That was all well-earned.
74,69,This is a joke. There's a whole article about this and the US government trying to get vaccines for children.
88,69,"CANNOTANSWER, I can hardly imagine why anyone would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I've seen a virus on my hand.', ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."""

The government is trying to make people resentful because of how many people are scared about it and what not.

69,63,"This is the most dangerous joke I know of. The CDC can't do shit, and you have to wear your mask at work. It's only a joke if there is no good medical advice."
69,64,I think that's why it's so funny and naive to think it was a joke. I think we should all give it a try.
74,69,I grew up with a lot of different people with different phobias.
88,69,Its funny the other day but the joke is a joke. The joke is just saying that they have to work to prevent HIV from spreading in a country that has a lot of medical problems to stop it from spreading.

69,6,People will be embarrassed if people say they don't know how to do the 'thing' they want.
69,10,"In the end, it isn't a joke. A joke."
69,13,"What's funny about this is that the person I saw said that he saw a virus and he told me about it, and then he went to the doctors and told him to leave because he wore it in public. This is actually a joke."
69,20,I'm pretty sure they didn't get the joke because they were sick.
69,22,I don't understand what the story is about. It's an important part of the issue. I think it is the right joke.

88,69,"CANNOTANSWER, I'm a fan of the idea of people wearing a mask when we're in public. I think a mask is pretty good IMO, the thing with it is that in the first few words it's not a joke.

69,49,"Yes. They should definitely put a ban on the government wearing a mask in public, as far as preventing infection."

69,63,"This is why people in the US wear masks, but in many countries the only thing that happens is if you have a virus. The CDC is only able to do this because they know how to prevent it from spreading in public."
69,64,"Why would people wear a mask in public, even if it is not really a joke? Because that is a joke that they have a good laugh at."
74,69,In all seriousness I would just like to point out that it's a joke about government policies against people with AIDS and not about people who do not have their hands on their child with AIDS.

93,69,You're a bitch about the tv commercials. You are not a creepy.
97,69,I don't think the point is that a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. The point is that the problem with that is that it's actually a joke and not a joke.

69,22,"The joke was about people not getting the vaccines they need. The joke was about people not getting the vaccines they needed because it could only be a joke if they don't know the way to the vaccine.

69,26,I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I work at the CDC. They're telling us what's important to them to help prevent AIDS and is making it a problem to prevent it from spreading.
69,49,"It's not about the government, it's about the CDC."
69,60,So you've got a lot of ideas of what to do when you think about something in this thread?
69,63,No. He's actually making a joke about this.
69,64,It would be a really dumb joke to be embarrassed if a mask made you not to want to know about the AIDS virus.
74,69,The story is also about a government hating on people who don't wear masks.
88,69,So you're saying that the government does not have a right to be embarrassed?

He said it's the best time to have a medical school massage. He had a big forehead on his forehead and the doctor was trying to protect him. He put it on his head while he was in the ER, and he said the same thing. It's not the best place to start in"

97,69,There are lots of jokes that are 'jokes' and you can't get around them.
69,5,I would go to a therapist and say I can't understand what the article is about. It's a joke but it isn't funny. There's a lot of controversy about how people are being raped or exploited. The best joke is that it's a joke and it doesn't make people laugh. The joke isn't funny at all.

69,64,AIDS/Sepsis vaccine in the U.S. is a ripoff of the AIDS/Sepsis vaccine. There is no way they can stop the spread of HIV without a vaccine.
74,69,I would like to point out that the joke is not silly. It's a joke because it's about the government trying to sabotage the situation.

97,69,"This has been the first time I've seen the CDC's article that references a joke about HIV, as opposed to any joke about the fact that a joke about HIV can help prevent the spread of the virus. It's not a joke because a joke about a virus makes you feel bad."

69,5,>The most funny joke is that it's a joke because it's about the government trying to sabotage the situation. It's not a joke.
69,6,Vaccine Advocacy is an article that supposedly points to the government wanting to stop the spread of a virus. I don't believe it is a joke. It's a good thing that the CDC has a plan for the virus to spread without going on the streets as quickly as possible.
