81,34,You should check out the other links for some useful stuff about the government.
81,36,He's a nefarious child.
81,44,He is wearing a mask.
81,49,"I believe it's a rule that the government has implemented that a lot of kids that are not safe are not infected by a virus, and it's a really good thing they have taken this measure to prevent the spread of it."
81,50,I have the same type of problem as a child i think wear a mask twitch
81,55,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,59,The government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,61,"i have a mask and i wear a mask i feel better, but i don't wear a mask as i have a scar on. i just do it for protection."
81,62,I used to be a child with a medical condition called covi - he was able to come home with a sandwich and we did the same thing.
81,66,>It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,80,I think a mask is a useful tool to protect yourself from people from the spread of a virus.

99,81,I know. And I know.. I know. I know.. I know..
81,34,And the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,36,He is wearing a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,44,He's a nefarious child. He is wearing a mask.
81,49,"""I think a mask is a useful tool to protect yourself from people from the spread of a virus. I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
81,50,"I don't think it's too bad for the kids. It's bad enough that they don't need a medical professional and can be seen with a lot of people. It's also very common for kids to have a very mild condition that is dangerous, so it's only a matter of time before they begin."
81,55,Well he's already been vaccinated for a flu... I think a'mask' is a good thing.
81,59,i have a few issues with the government and that doesn't mean that i can't get vaccines but i can get vaccinated
81,61,They also don't get to use a protective mask when people need it most if not all the time because there are a lot of people that are sick and who have an immune system that is infested with viruses.
81,62,"As a kid I did that with my mom, and I had a terrible tinnitus a few years back."
81,66,"yep, but it is actually good advice. and he is wearing a mask and I think it is a really good thing they have taken this measure to prevent the spread of a virus."
81,80,OP: He's a nefarious child. He is wearing a mask.

99,81,"OP, you should read about this and the fact that if you have a virus on Halloween or something, I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too."
81,34,I want to know why this is so popular among kids... 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'
81,36,Is this the one you want to see on TV?
81,44,"I read a video where Santa wears a mask and the doctor says to the kid, ""That's not a very good thing unless you can get vaccinated. If you can't get vaccinated, you can still get vaccinated. I think a mask is a good thing."""
81,49,"I had a medical condition called covi once and it was a severe flu. I was a very good boy, so I am a little scared and my mum got a flu, too."
81,50,"I'd read the whole thing, but it would definitely be worth reading. You got to learn something. You did that for the reason that OP - and I also - did not get to hear."
81,55,"I'm really worried that you're going to see the first season of Season 2 and it'll be a little different. The season starts on July. They were probably going to start a campaign of vaccination for this year, with the implication that the future will be filled with a bunch of vaccines for all the kids that get it. It will get pretty scary."
81,59,It's the least common and most common thing for people with a cold to get vaccinated and I am glad the kids are being taken care of.
81,61,The kids who don't get vaccinated on Halloween and have a medical condition can get shot.
81,62,"I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too."
81,66,This is an awful joke. I can't help but think that some of these are very naive and do a really good job of making the government do something like this.
81,80,"""A nefarious child is wearing a mask."""
95,81,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
99,81,Wearing a mask in the parade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask.
81,34,I can't find it if you read the title of this post. It's not that I'm asking for answers. You are not being sarcastic.
81,36,I love the show. I'm a neocon conservative and I'm in the mood to watch it again.
81,44,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. Wearing a mask in the parade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcare heroes wearamask.
81,49,"The guy who made the poster that said ""Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."" It's actually a pretty big joke, considering the way he speaks."
81,50,"I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask. That's why they wear them."
81,55,It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
81,59,"I think this is a great joke, I can't wait to see it too."
81,61,"I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too."

81,66,"I've heard some people like to think ""there is nothing the government can do"" when the OP is being made fun of."
81,80,"They don't have to get vaccines when the government is using them, so if you don't get vaccinated you can still get vaccinated."
95,81,"What the hell? You don't see a lot of children in our society, are you?"
99,81,"It's not overdue for the movie and it is very vague. So, there's the santa wearing a mask at Santa's house. You're not even a santa. A santa wearing a mask in the parade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask."
81,34,What's the point of this?
81,36,"The guy who made the poster that said ""Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."" It's actually a pretty big joke, considering the way he speaks. I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask. That's why they wear them. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. I think this is a great joke."
81,44,The only way we can see this in the movie is when you see Santa's face.
81,49,"He was a bit of a naive child who was never vaccinated. But at this point it's a lot more important that we take care of people, as well as that it's the best way to prevent a child from getting a cold or the worst way to protect themselves. It's not fair that this is a popular joke, and it's probably a good way to get kids to come along."

81,62,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,66,I like to think 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus'.
81,80,That's the most funny thing I've ever heard from a child.
95,81,The gov't does not care about children who aren't being vaccinated. It doesn't care what the government is doing. It cares about protecting the community and how the government is treating it. There is no such thing as an uninvited child.
99,81,The entire thing that is a joke despite the movie being snide is so bad it's too easy to put an end to it.
81,34,I think the problem here is that the movie is too long and you really need to take a break from that.
81,36,"I'd love to see this in the movie too. I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids... 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus'."
81,44,"There are no laws regarding wearing masks when a child hasn't been vaccinated, and no law concerning the government's use of them. They are a way to protect their children from their own harmful effects."
81,49,"Is it like that Santa actually has a mask on? It’s a bit of a joke in that he’s wearing a mask, not a helmet, and doesn’t like being told to put his face on. The santa is wearing a mask, and the mask is on. But it’s actually a great joke, considering the way he speaks. I think it’s a good way to get kids to come along."
81,50,I thought I was the only one who knew this. I have to remember that my parents have told me this and I am sure I was one of them.
81,55,A mask to help stop a spread of a virus.
81,59,I don't know how you can be a child but I'm sure that's exactly what you meant.
81,61,"Its like what happens when you don't know anyone, right?"
81,62,Is that why he's wearing a mask? I just don't understand how people use it when they feel a person is doing a wrong thing.
81,66,"A lot of kids still think it's a great joke but unless you see the video, you just get pissed that a naive child is wearing a mask and it's like ""you can't prevent a kid from getting a cold."""
81,80,"I don't think this is a good idea. It might be a great idea, but it's a little too easy to jar a child into the conversation and start to come off as too naive."
95,81,The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not actually a joke because it's not a joke but the CDC is the only one in the country that is actually going to be working in the next four decades to actually do what they can to stop the spread of a virus.
99,81,It's not a joke because of the title. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke because the title is... not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide because it's so bad it's too easy to put an end to it.
81,34,...a lot of kids still think it's a great idea. It might be a little too easy to jar a child into the conversation and start to come off as too naive. The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a joke because the title is... not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
81,36,"It is not a joke, a joke. It is a joke, a joke."
81,44,"I didn't know this, I'm not a child"
81,49,I read the title and thought it was a joke...
81,50,"The fact that it's a joke is not the only reason I think a santa's wearing a mask is a joke. That's the point that it's a joke, not something that's funny."
81,55,"I was in an elementary school in the 50s and it was one of the things I'd hear every day on my phone. I would stop talking to kids about this shit and just think, 'hey, I've been here for a while, let's stop talking about this stuff, I can tell you the truth and I won't stop talking'!"
81,59,A mask to prevent a sick person from getting a virus. A mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,61,I've heard that the government has no interest in protecting kids and it is a way to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,62,"I don't think there is enough evidence that people believe that a child is going to have an infection, but I do think that a child being exposed to a disease is a good example."
81,66,"Yes, the problem with it is that it's the best joke out there. Its funny because it's fun but not just because it's a joke."
81,80,"""The government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
95,81,This doesn't even mean a joke to you. This means it's a joke. It's not like it's a joke. It's a joke.
99,81,"I think a very good idea is that if you have a virus, it will spread to you."
81,34,You're being a dick.
81,36,It is the one joke people make on social media.
81,44,"The title is snide. It's a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. I don't think it's a good idea, but it makes sense."
81,49,You don't know how the government does that to children. They are not being given the chance to get vaccines if they're at risk.
81,50,>I'm not a child I read the title and thought it was a joke
81,55,It's not a joke.
81,59,">I don't know how you can be a child but I'm sure that's exactly what you meant. Its like what happens when you don't know anyone, right? Is that why he's wearing a mask?"
81,61,"So, the whole 'what if i'm sick of a virus' thing is pretty cool too."
81,62,Until we reach the age of 23 and see the government take care of this and that's how I feel about my kids :-)
81,66,"I'm not sure what your point is, but some of the facts are valid."
81,80,I like to make it a joke because I've done it with everyone I meet on the internet.
95,81,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,81,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
81,34,>What's the point of this?
81,36,"The title isn't a joke. I don't see how that could be considered a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
81,44,I thought that you meant the title is a joke.
81,49,"As someone who's already heard it, I'm surprised you don't understand this quote."
81,50,"You mean ""he can be a child who thinks they're being a dick."""
81,55,The first point is that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,59,"What is the point of a mask, if you think it's a joke? You know that they are wearing it."
81,61,"That's kind of a joke if it doesn't make sense, eh?"
81,62,"I think the 'What if I'm sick of a virus' joke is pretty cool. Its like what happens when you don't know anyone, right?"
81,66,I was on a roll and my kids were sick so I was very pissed that they weren't being given vaccines. That's where I'm getting sick from.
81,80,"I think a joke about the government being a sick person is a good idea. However, that's not how I feel about my kids."
95,81,The CDC doesn't care about children who aren't getting vaccinated. It doesn't care what the government is doing.
99,81,We need a mask - they are not supposed to be funny - they are supposed to be pretty.
81,34,This isn't a joke. This is a joke. It's not a joke.
81,36,He sounds like a narcissist. It's not a joke. He's a joke. He's not a joke. It's a joke because a joke doesn't make sense.
81,44,"I don't see how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
81,49,"I'm the CDC's director, and I know that's a shit load of kids, but this whole 'what if i'm sick of a virus' thing is pretty tame. I think this is a good idea because it is a funny, but annoying joke."
81,50,The first joke is...what?
81,55,It isn't a joke. It's a joke because it is not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it. The government can't help themselves in that way.
81,59,"Making a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'' (as in, 'What if I'm sick of a virus')."
81,61,"A good laugh at this is that they seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on how this works, rather than putting on a mask themselves."
81,62,It's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
81,66,"So, the government has a role in the spread of viruses? Are you sure?"
81,80,So what happens if you don't get vaccinated?
95,81,I have some research to show that vaccines prevent the spread of viruses and cause a higher risk of pneumonia.
99,81,"They're the reason why we don't like it if people think the title is snide. If you don't like the movie, you're not a santa or clown. I'm not a santa or clown."
81,34,Because the word 'tame' is still a joke. 'What if I'm sick of a virus'
81,36,I'm gonna use my new iPhone to see this movie.
81,44,"I think the title is snide. It's a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. I don't see how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
81,49,"> I don't see how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
81,50,"You mean ""you mean ""he can be a child who thinks they are being a dick."""
81,55,It's not a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. The government can't help themselves in that way.
81,59,"There's a funny, but annoying joke about the CDC trying to keep children from getting vaccinated."
81,61,The first part of my post is the CDC's director. Is there a source for this?
81,62,The last part is pretty hilarious.
81,66,Its a joke because it isn't a joke.
81,80,"If I had a kid that was sick of the virus, I would have told him I was a narcissist as opposed to just a nicer guy, and I'd tell him I was sick of a virus because of the way I treated him."
95,81,The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not actually a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke.
99,81,"I think you're right, but we need a new and improved one. I think people do need to find a new word for it:"
81,34,The word is still a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
81,36,It's a joke because the government doesn't help themselves.
81,44,"I read a video where Santa wears a mask and the doctor says to the kid, ""That's not a very good thing unless you can get vaccinated. If you can't get vaccinated, you can still get vaccinated."" I think it's a good joke. A good laugh at this is that they seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on how this works, rather than putting on a mask themselves."
81,49,"In the US, there's actually a few different people who were able to tell the difference between the two."
81,50,I think the main point of a joke is that the CDC has a role in the spread of viruses.
81,55,"I'm not saying it is a joke, but because there is no such thing as a joke, the world is just a joke. There is no such thing as a joke."
81,59,"If I was a child, I wouldn't be sick of the disease."
81,61,"""This joke is a joke because it's not a joke. I think people need to find a new and improved one. I think people do need to find a new word for it: ""What if I'm sick of a virus?"
81,62,I'm sick of the title - 'what if I'm sick of a virus'.
81,66,"""'I think a new and improved one. I think people do need to find a new and improved one.''"
81,80,"The title of the comic - A good laugh at this is that they seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on how this works, rather than putting on a mask themselves. It might be a good joke because it's a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. They're the reason why we don't like it in the US, as well as in the UK."
95,81,The CDC is the only one in the country that is actually going to be working in the next four decades to actually do what they can to stop the spread of a virus.

81,34,> I think it's a good joke because it's not a joke. I think people need to find a new and improved one. I think people need to find a new and improved one.
81,36,It's so scary that you don't even want to see it in a movie because you are sick of it. You are sick of it because you can't get vaccinated.
81,44,I think the main point of a joke is that the government has a role in the spread of viruses.
81,49,"It's a joke that's the reason it's a joke, but it's not the reason the government doesn't act like they should. It's a joke that's not a joke but a joke that's a joke."
81,50,"The word is ""Joke"" in the UK, because it's just a joke, and the joke is about how it affects the world. I think it's a good joke."
81,55,I think the most important part of this is that we don't have the CDC's mandate to do anything - it's not just about the CDC. We have a system in place to help protect against any potential vaccines. We don't have a set set of rules for what's considered to be a joke.
81,59,[[The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/news/fr/mccbd.aspx) explains that the government uses masks for viruses. The CDC is a very large corporation that can be manipulated by its employees to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,61,I think the word is still a joke because it's not a joke.
81,62,As a kid I would think that any joke in the world would have been pretty good if they put on a mask to prevent people from getting sick.
81,66,"It's not funny, it's not a joke, and it's not really what it is. That's it. It's a joke. Its a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. But it's not a joke. I think people need to find a new and improved one."
81,80,The joke about the government being a sick person is an example of how people don't like it.
95,81,"I read that last sentence when I was a kid and thought this was a joke. I said, ""What the hell? You don't see a lot of children in our society, are you?"" and I was like, ""What the hell? You don't see a lot of children in our society, are you?"", ""We're making a joke, but I don't get the whole point of the point. It's not a joke, but I don't get the whole point of the point of the point."
99,81,"The joke was just like ""I'm not a doctor, but I know many people who are allergic to the virus and a doctor who explains how to wear a mask in a movie and in the movie explains how they are allergic to the cyborg costumes."""
81,34,"It's a joke, because it's a joke, and because the humor is an important thing for it."
81,36,He's a narcissist who's a joke and not a human being.
81,44,No one EVER said that the CDC used masks. They use them because it prevents it from spreading in the US.
81,49,"...I see that this joke is a joke, but it is not a joke."
81,50,"I don't see why the CDC can't do more in the UK and have a mandate to do anything. It's a joke in that it's about how it affects the world, but it's just a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
81,55,"a lot of people seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on how this works, rather than putting on a mask to prevent people from getting sick."
81,59,"The word CDC doesn't have a mandate, so they're not making a joke."
81,61,It was a joke in the video that it was about a doctor who told his children to have a vaccination.
81,62,"People are joking about how people use the word ""joke"" in many countries, but the most widely accepted way to joking about what is considered a joke is because that is what it's about."
81,66,I believe there are many reasons people wouldn't like the government's 'Joke' that's used to describe the fact that there's a government role in the spread of viruses in this country.
81,80,"That's a joke about how the government doesn't do anything besides putting on a mask to prevent someone from getting vaccinated. They can't actually do anything other than get sick, and that's what makes it a joke. The CDC is the only one in the country that is actually going to be working in the next four decades to actually do what they can to stop the spread of a virus."
95,81,"I didn't think it was a joke, but I felt like it was a joke."
99,81,I think it's interesting that there is a doctor who explains how to wear a mask at a film festival.
81,34,"A lot of kids think it's a joke, but it isn't a joke. They think it's a joke."
81,36,"I am not a doctor. I am a doctor. I just love my family. I've made it to school, but I am not a doctor."
81,44,"The joke is not a joke, but a joke."
81,49,This is what I am going to say:
81,50,"I'm not a doctor, but I know some people who believe the CDC is a joke. That's a good point if I were to ask for help."
81,55,"The last one is just one of a lot of them. I just feel like you're not giving a shit about a joke, and the last one just seems a little silly."
81,59,It's just a joke.
81,61,"""I think the word is still a joke because it's not a joke. I think people need to find a new and improved one. I think people need to find a new and improved one."
81,62,That's the joke that I was going to make. The next word is a joke.
81,66,"Yes, you are correct. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
81,80,The CDC will put on more cyborg costumes than the CDC does in the future if they don't know how to make them.
95,81,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
99,81,A cloner wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is a very simple point. A cloner who has had an hilarity joke about the issue is not going to like the idea of a cloner wearing a mask and is going to have to have a cloner to avoid people who may have it. It would be fun to put it in your face. I think it's funny that Santa doesn't wear a mask because of the title.
81,34,"No, this isn't a joke. A joke. It's a joke. A joke."
81,36,"""But it is a joke because they can't make it work."""

81,50,"I don't see how it isn't a joke, but it's actually a joke."
81,55,"The CDC is a joke and is not a joke. The CDC is the only government in the country that isn't making a joke, which is why they haven't put any effort to do anything other than stop spreads of viruses."
81,59,"The best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting sick. There's nothing they can do to help protect the public from sick people. It's a joke, the CDC isn't trying to stop children from getting sick or getting sick, but is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's just a joke."
81,61,What the fuck is wrong with a joke?
81,62,What if a child is wearing a mask in a school or a race. You go up to a party and you get a tinnitus?
81,66,"I don't even like the word ""joke,"" I like how there are several reasons people don't like a joke about the government."
81,80,This is not a joke. It is a joke. It is not a joke.
95,81,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's not just the government that is trying to make people feel better.
99,81,"I'm a big fan of that movie, because that was a funny movie - and that's why I'm happy to see it. It also sounds like a great comedy movie - because there is so much more to it."
81,34,"It's not a joke, it's just a joke. It's not a joke."
81,36,"In addition to all of the other things, there is a very simple reason why it's so popular among kids."
81,44,"I'm a big fan of the CDC, but I can't tell you how the title describes a cloner wearing a mask. I think there are several reasons people don't like a joke about the government."
81,49,It's pretty interesting how the whole CDC shaming of the government thing works despite the fact that it's not a joke.
81,50,"Yes, I think it is funny that Santa doesn't wear a mask because it's not a joke, it's a joke because it is the only thing they can do to stop spreads of viruses."
81,55,"I sat in my bedroom and told this guy he was a big deal, I was shocked to see him and the others, I thought he was funny, and that they all reacted the same as me a lot, but they were really nice and kind. I really loved that movie"
81,59,"""... what if you're a child, I wouldn't be sick of the disease."""
81,61,"Considering that this isn't the joke he was trying to get, he seems to be putting himself above the general public, even if it's just a joke."
81,62,I think it's hilarious that a clone who is sick of a virus is wearing a mask.
81,66,I'd be more interested in the CDC tinnitus joke.
81,80,"Yes, I've been there."

99,81,I think the joke is that the cloner is going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

81,49,"A lot of people think ""what if i'm sick of a virus."" is a joke, but it isn't."
81,50,"It's a joke about the government's efforts to make a joke out of it. It's not like the CDC is a joke. They are trying to make people feel better, they are just a joke."
81,55,There's a big difference between a joke and a joke. The joke is the joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that the cloner is going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
81,59,I don't see a joke for him. His joke is something I'd think the CDC would do in this case. I just do think it's a good way to get people's attention.
81,61,"They don't actually want to get sick, the CDC needs to do something to stop them from spreading it."
81,62,CDC's slogan was 'I'd love to see this too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids. '
81,66,"The CDC has given children a few medical treatments that work better, such as a vaccine and antibiotics for the flu, which is a really good thing."
81,80,"You're comparing a movie and a comedian to a comedy. The CDC, in this case, can make an honest joke about how much they love the movie if they don't understand it."
95,81,''Wearing a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated'''.
99,81,"People will not accept that it is a joke, because there is more to the story. The joke might not be true, but its not in a way to discredit the point."
81,34,I don't know if you understand what is going on in these paragraphs. But as in I know you're not a doctor. You just look at the title and you feel like there is a joke.
81,36,It's an honest joke and a joke doesn't make sense.
81,44,The joke isn't a joke in the sense of helping prevent sick people from getting sick.
81,49,"The word 'Joke' would be ""Jake"" as in 'Jake'."
81,50,"It's also interesting that he says that a mask isn't going to stop the spread of the flu. ""I don't think that's a joke, but it's a joke"" (""I'm not a doctor, but I know some people who believe the CDC is a joke"")."
81,55,As long as you don't give a shit about it you are not giving a shit. This cdc tinnitus joke makes no sense. It's a joke that is just the part you make fun of.
81,59,"So if the government could do something about it, and they were willing to, then it wouldn't matter?"
81,61,"Aside from being a joke, I don't see any reason why this is a joke. It's a joke in the sense that it's a joke. The CDC's slogan was 'I'd love to see this too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids. '"

95,81,"I've read a lot of articles about people getting vaccinated. In my book, 'Why did my daughter get vaccinated at 15?', it says 'You know, I'm just trying to get all the kids to get vaccinated so we don't get sick or get sick. I also want kids to be vaccinated.'"
99,81,"A ""cloner"" could use a clone and wear a mask, though, and possibly be a medical name for it. If you know there are multiple versions that have an effect on that, you can always make it a joke with the clone. That's all it's asking you to do."
81,34,I can't even say what's a joke unless I have the courage to say it. This kind of joke is just a joke and they say the truth.
81,36,This sounds like a clone and is probably a joke.
81,44,"The word 'joke' is often confused with 'Joke'. So basically, if it's a joke, it's a joke."

81,59,The CDC is the organization that gets kids and adults to get vaccinated. They're not a joke.

95,81,I read the article (which is a good start) and I think it's important that these comments be more in line with the rest of the text. The entire point of the post is:
99,81,"A lot of the jokes in the movie seem really simple. Honestly, I think you're going to have to tell people exactly what a joke is."
81,34,"It sounds like a joke, to me."
81,36,I have never heard a joke say it's an honest joke and a joke doesn't make sense.
81,44,"Aside from being a joke, the jokes in the movie are not so much about how a clone is supposed to help kids."
81,49,It's very strange that the first CDC and the CDC to put that in place is a bunch of jokes that get mixed up.
81,50,It's about how the government would be better if they could stop the spread of a virus.
81,55,The first jokes are a joke if you don't understand them.
81,59,'I think the best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting vaccinated.
81,61,It's a good way for kids to know.
81,62,"No, this is a joke, because if the government had anything to do with that, they wouldn't have used it. It's a joke. It's a joke in the sense that it's a joke."
81,66,"I'm a fan of the movies, but I still think it's good humor."
81,80,I'm in awe of this idea.
95,81,"What do you mean, the joke about people who are vaccinated, if they get sick?"
99,81,They say it's a joke. That's what they are trying to say.
81,34,"That's a very good joke. You know, I was born with a nose and a big mouth when I was little. I thought that was a joke. Then I realized what I was saying: it's just a joke."
81,36,"Despite the fact that it is a joke, I think it is a good idea to make fun of a plethora of other people who don't understand this joke."
81,44,Having read the whole article and now reading the other posts I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to read them all together.
81,49,There's a big difference between a joke and a joke.
81,50,"I read the title and thought it was a joke. I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask. That's why they wear them.

81,66,"I'm going to look for a funny one to make fun of the government. I'm more interested in the film ""The Red Cross,"" it's an awesome movie. It's all about a government role in the spread of viruses."
81,80,ahh this is really not a joke.
95,81,"It seems a bit odd that the CDC has a joke that makes people think a person who gets vaccinated can get something else, or who wants them to get vaccines."
99,81,"I think you're right that people have to tell people exactly what a joke is. It's a joke because 'they're the reason why we don't like it if people think the title is snide'. ""They say it's a joke because they're a joke because they aren't supposed to be funny."""
81,34,No one should be going on a date with a kid who wants to get vaccinated. Especially if they don't know what a joke is and are afraid to give them it.

The CDC is a very large corporation that can be manipulated by its employees to prevent the spread of a virus.''(as in, 'If I was a child, I wouldn't be sick of the disease.'')"
81,61,It's a joke to make fun of other people.
81,62,There's a lot more to this joke than the title alone does. I don't know why it seems snide.
81,66,It's all about a government role in the spread of viruses. ''But it's not a joke.
81,80,This movie sounds interesting. You'll also like this movie for the kids as a couple.
95,81,"I don't think you're being serious - in this case, you have a joke. I think the point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's a joke and the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.

81,55,The government is a troll. The government is a joke because it is a troll. It is a joke because they are a troll.

81,61,"I've been talking about this movie a lot, and it sounds interesting. It sounds like the Red Cross is trying to stop a virus. ''We have the CDC, CDC, CDC and Red Cross to work with the health care industry to prevent a spread of a virus."

81,36,"It's not about the government, it's about the government. It's about a group of people that are sick of people's sickness and are sick of people's illness."

81,55,"I don't think the CDC is a joke. I think they are trying to make fun of the problem, which makes sense if they don't want to see the issue and not the problem."
81,59,The problem is that people are not immune from it and don’t know how it works. The CDC is not trying to stop that. It’s a joke because they can’t make it work.

81,34,"I think they’re trying to make fun of the problem, and then make fun of them in other ways. They’re trying to make fun of the problem but don’t."
81,36,I'm actually more concerned that it's the one joke that people like and that they don't understand.
81,44,"I'm a huge fan of the CDC. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. I don't think I can handle how people feel about this, but the question is how can we actually make a joke about a clone being a joke?"

81,62,"Is there any way you can make it a joke? Because it's a joke. But that's about it. If you want to make a joke about the government, you need to find a way to make it a joke. Then you need to know why it's a joke. Is it an ethical joke?"
81,66,Honestly I found the humor funny and the video interesting as well. The only thing is that we figured that the government isn't doing anything like this. I don't know if that's the same as the problem but I just think it's pretty funny.

81,59,"The ""Making a mask to prevent the spread of a virus"" joke is pretty funny"
81,61,"I can honestly say that the jokes are good, but the jokes are just to make fun of others."
81,62,"""""What if I'm sick of a virus?'"""""
81,66,"It's pretty funny, and it makes no sense, but it's a joke."
81,80,It is a joke about the government and its actions. It's a joke about the government that is trying to stop the spread of a virus. What a snide comment!
95,81,"You mean ""Hey, I am actually a little kid and still kept coming up with a joke about how my kids couldn't get vaccinated because of that."" and """
99,81,This is where the jokes get really ridiculous.
81,34,> I don't understand what is going on in these paragraphs.
81,36,It's actually a joke because it's about a group of people that are sick of people's sickness and are sick of people's illness.
81,44,A few things that make the joke a joke:
81,49,"'' I don't understand how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK."
81,50,I was reading the whole thing to be honest.
81,55,You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
81,59,"""I think the best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting vaccinated."""
81,61,"There's a link on Wikipedia to a whole section of the video that discusses the CDC's approach. They're looking at this as a way to get people to stop getting sick. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They are also trying to help those who can't get it, so the video gets a rebuttal."
81,62,Is a CDC employee making jokes? Because santa makes jokes about their government because he's a CDC employee.
81,66,"It's not a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke and it's a joke because the joke is a joke."
81,80,"You are the joke. The joke is what you made of it. A great comedy and a bad one. The jokes about the government causing cancer and causing the spread of HIV have nothing to do with a 'nicer' person. The jokes about the CDC actually seem to be about a joke because they are about the government preventing it. They are about the government actually trying to stop it, which is pretty funny."
95,81,It's not a joke because it doesn't even come close to being the correct word and it's not a joke because it's not a joke.
99,81,I think the only way it should be funny is if santa was wearing a mask to scare off all the pixie dust.
81,34,"I don't like the name of the comment. It doesn't sound like a joke. I would say it sounds like a joke, and not a joke, but that it's a good joke and makes the point that it's not a joke."
81,36,"You get a mask, and it makes no sense in any way. The joke isn't a joke, it's a joke."
81,44,i'm a big fan of the CDC.
81,49,"The UK has a joke about a clone, as in a joke of how santa doesn't seem to know why"
81,50,"""I thought that I was the only one who knew this. I have to remember that my parents have told me this and I am sure I was one of them."""
81,55,People seem to think that they have a point. The CDC isn't a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. It's a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. The CDC is a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. There is no such thing as a joke.
81,59,I’m a little tired of the jokes.
81,61,"''What's a joke because it's a joke. It is a joke because it is funny.""''"
81,62,"It's funny because it's a joke, because it's a joke about the government that is trying to stop the spread of viruses."
81,66,"I think the whole CDC movie is not a good one for you, but I'm not a fan."
81,80,"The CDC's approach to preventing HIV is a joke. The only way to explain that is to ""let it go"" and then make a joke about it."
95,81,I was in a medical school where I was told to get a vaccination when I was five. My parents gave me a prescription and I took it when they were six and when they got the first vaccination I had a headache and my grandmother was in a medical school that had a vaccination for about 8 months before I got the flu.
99,81,"I think the best way to say that is ""I think it's a joke because they aren't supposed to be funny."", ""I think it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke about the joke isn't a joke"
81,34,"I read that, it sounds like a joke. Having a clone of the government is a joke."
81,36,Because the whole point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's so easy to make a joke and they can't make a joke.
81,44,I think the difference is between 'I think it's a joke' and 'Jokes'.
81,49,It's funny because it's a joke about the government. And santa isn't supposed to know why it's a joke.
81,50,op did not get to hear it. he has to have learned something.
81,55,They're trying to make a joke out of this.
81,59,CDC has a joke about the CDC trying to stop the spread of a virus.
81,61,'I'd love to see this too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids.'
81,62,"I mean I'd make a good joke if a CDC employee did that, but it doesn't sound so funny. That's not the point."
81,66,This is how they explain their approach.
81,80,"This is just a joke. It's not like the joke is about a snide comment, it's that it's about a joke - a joke about a joke about the government causing HIV."
95,81,The CDC doesn't care what the government is doing. It's working for the nation and the world. It's not like the CDC is doing anything about the people who are actually not affected by it. It's not a joke.
99,81,"““I thought that the jokes he made were about the fact that if the doctor couldn’t find a way to use a mask for the clone, then we’d be going out there and trying to get one."
81,34,"I'd tell my parents, if they're like ""It's a joke, because I think it's a joke"" (not that it's a joke) that it's a joke, then just stop making jokes about it."
81,36,You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's funny because it's about the government. CDC doesn't care what the government is doing. It's working for the nation and the world. It's not like the CDC is doing anything about the people who are actually not affected by it. It's not. The CDC doesn't care what the government is doing.
81,44,There are also examples of clones that are very common in various cultures.
81,49,I was raised in a CDC clone.
81,50,"I am in a hospital and I have been in a coma for three months because I get the flu a lot. I can't be sure what to say if my mom's not going to ask for help in case someone needs help. I don't know about all the people in this room and i don't know if I can stand the jokes. I just know a lot. I don't care if i get to go to the doctor in an emergency. If my family isn't going to do something like this, it's not"
81,55,And now the CDC is gonna get away with making a joke that's all it can be.
81,59,That's not a joke. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus.
81,61,The CDC is working with government organizations to stop the spread of a virus.
81,62,"What do you call a ""joke""? It's kind of like ""joke"" because it doesn't have the same meaning as a ""joke"" because you don't understand it. It's a joke because it's funny."
81,66,"If it's true, they are just trying to get the people to wear a mask. It's not a joke because they're funny."
81,80, Isn’t this a joke?
95,81,"That's a joke. That is a joke, that's a joke. You aren't being serious about it. That's a joke. It is a joke, but it isn't a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. It's not a joke, it's a joke.

99,81,The word clone in the joke is just a joke about what the clone is.

81,36,It's a joke because they're going to go out and get it.

81,34,That is the underlying concept behind that song.
81,36,Because I'm a doctor. I am sick of being sick. And I'm sick of having to have a clone of HIV.
