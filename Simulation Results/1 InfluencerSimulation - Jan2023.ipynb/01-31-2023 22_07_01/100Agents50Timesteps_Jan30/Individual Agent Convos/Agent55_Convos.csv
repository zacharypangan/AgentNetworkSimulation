55,50,You've been doing a good job of saying you wore a mask.
55,54,I'm surprised there's not any sort of antimicrobial in the U.S. as a result of the epidemic
81,55,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

55,3,The government has an obligation to keep everyone safe – not the children and the government itself.
55,5,I don't believe they have any protection at all. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,11,"In our country, people are always on the offensive. In fact, this was the last time the government ever had to issue a masked or dummy in our parks. We have a very specific policy on the act of masked masked."
55,16,I'm sure there's something there.
55,17,I want to give this guy his hat and thank him for the help. He has a very interesting voice and he doesn't seem to care.
55,18,"I know what you mean, but what do you mean by wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"
55,23,I have no idea what this is about. I have seen lots of other people who have not had a sneezed or shaved face and are terrified of them.
55,24,"You don't want to talk about this, but it is very likely something your employer does. In some states we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. That said, I believe there is a difference in the way this is viewed by some people. You're making a huge mistake in that you're talking about it."
55,25,I see no reason why I want to wear a mask.
55,40,"People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
55,44,He is a great artist. He is a woman. He can play with you in the public spaces. He can do the work for you in the private spaces.
55,45,"OP. This is so true. I mean, I've been running through a lot of different things in my life. I'm also pretty good at hiding my body in a mask."
55,50,I am surprised there's not any sort of antimicrobial in the U.S. as a result of the epidemic Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,54,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they want them in their life and that they are aware of the risks and that they will take them on."
81,55,Well he's already been vaccinated for a flu... I think a'mask' is a good thing.
88,55,It's a huge red flag in this sub for the government. You have to be ready to run on people's hands and be prepared for other people.
93,55,"He does the work well, and he doesn't look like he's too good."
94,55,Basically the government was equivocating what they needed to do.
55,3,"I'm not sure if you can be bothered by the ""government having an obligation to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself."" (Same as OP, this is a post involving the issue of the government doing anti-viral measures)"
55,5,"They are still saying that a ""masked mask is needed to stop the spread of a virus. In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."

55,16,It's a big red flag in this sub for the government. You have to be ready to run on people's hands and be prepared for other people.
55,17,I'm going to go out on a limb and say this: I think a mask is a good idea. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,18,[Liking in the face of a masked face is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The government has an obligation to keep everyone safe – not the children and the government itself. I don't believe they have any protection at all.

55,25,"op, i was so confused because i read that he wasn't aware he was going to wear a mask."
55,40,People wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face.
55,44,"I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
55,45,"Unless they are'masked'to show off their sexual capabilities, they are not required to wear a mask or have them do anything. The government was equivocating - the government is not being honest with those who have made that move."

55,54,"My dad wore a mask for a lot of fun he told me. It worked so well for him. I still don't think the government has to make money off of his mask, nor should I accredit my friends."
81,55,"I'm really worried that you're going to see the first season of Season 2 and it'll be a little different. The season starts on July. They were probably going to start a campaign of vaccination for this year, with the implication that the future will be filled with a bunch of vaccines for all the kids that get it. It will get pretty scary."
88,55,"You know, like in the video ""No one's going to run"" is just a line that is utterly deceptive in some places."
93,55,"""He is a great artist. I hope you enjoy his work."""
94,55,There is a nasa on the news right now.
55,3,"In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."

55,17,It's one of the biggest political issues of the country in a lot of ways.
55,18,"We need more people like that, and more people who like to paint their faces or wear them because they're afraid of danger."

55,25,"i just finished the video and the video was a bit of a jumble of ""people wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face."""
55,40,The government isn't obligated to prevent illness. It's obligated to do anti-viral measures. It's obligated to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself.
55,44,"In my experience people wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face."
55,45,I am afraid of being called out on it by a non-English speaker and getting my head scratched by a language barrier.
55,50,Isn't it crazy that you see a guy bringing a face mask to prevent a virus in the U.S.?
55,54,"That's actually the point that my mom made me. I would shave and rub her face to stop sneezing, because that would make me a little uncomfortable."
81,55,It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
88,55,"If you get caught, and are worried, or you can't take your hands off, then you are a dangerous person and deserve a proper doctor. You will need a doctor on your side, and that is up to you."
93,55,Yes it is. We have to keep it real.
94,55,"[This is the kind of stuff that a NSA can do. I do not have the right to be an asshole, but if the CIA can not do anything about it then they aren't. I have to rely on that medical advice as a sort of treatment."
55,3,The US has been using anti-viral measures against viruses in an attempt to prevent infections.
55,5,I'm not sure I think it would be very interesting if someone wrote this about a guy who is bringing a mask to prevent a virus. He doesn't really need a mask to stop it. He just wants to try to get some new friends to put on a mask for him so he doesn't get a fucking headache. I think the NSA could be right - they don't need a mask to stop a virus.
55,11,You're not a dangerous person and deserve a proper doctor. Yes it is. We have to keep it real.
55,16,"As far as I can tell, the NSA has done nothing. The government obligates to make people think that it's their job to protect people and make them think they are good."
55,17,"The NSA has no right to do anything about it, except that it's one of its most powerful programs - a public health organization."
55,18,"I'm going to go ahead and post this, I think it's a great idea to do it. We need to take care of everyone as well as the world at large and let it shine through. I want to see the first season of season 2."
55,23,"You can go to any nasa website and see the FAQs, but it's not a valid explanation. It's a'very important topic' in public schools. It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it might, at least in the beginning. There are some other concerns of that kind, including not having the ability to be aware of dangerous people and their feelings."
55,24,I can't believe that there is a nasa article in the wiki or the podcast that states people wearing masks to prevent illness are supposed to use a mask to prevent virus spread.
55,25,It’s pretty common for people who are afraid of getting hit by a car to work in the USA to avoid getting sneezed or shaved. And that’s a good thing.
55,40,I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two. I don't think the government would need to make an effort to stop it.
55,44,"I am in New Mexico, and the first time a NSA agent effected me is I was just playing with my friends in a restaurant in a park. Then I went out to see him, and he just came to me, telling me he was infected. Then I went to a clinic in a city in the state, and I saw an eye doctor for the first time. I think there is no one at all."
55,45,That's how it is supposed to be done - they have to.
55,50,">I do not have the right to be an asshole, but if the CIA can not do anything about it then they aren't. I have to rely on that medical advice as a sort of treatment. I have to go to the doctor if I am worried that it might get worse."
55,54,Why are people saying that you need a mask to prevent illness?
81,55,"The people who make the poster that said ""Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."""
88,55,I'm gonna take this on as part of a more serious problem I have: I hate to say it but you're not being totally reasonable with the concept of a'medical mask'. Why do you think that the mask mandate is required to protect against HIV is necessary to prevent someone who doesn't have HIV in public to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what you mean.
93,55,I have to admit I don't get what you're saying but I do have a sense of humor. I think I think some people just aren't the most humorous.
94,55,"There are a lot of NSA stuff, not the actual actual science, and I have seen plenty of people who did it as well."
55,3,"So if they can't protect against the spread of the virus, they're not supposed to protect against this?"
55,5,"If this isn't possible, you're right. The NSA isn't going to stop the spread of HIV in any kind of way."
55,11,"> I don't believe they have any protection at all."", ""In our country, people are always on the offensive. In fact, this was the last time the government ever had to issue a masked or dummy in our parks. We have a very specific policy on the act of masked masked."
55,16,"I don't get how the NSA is supposed to stop it, it's not like they're in the middle of something."
55,17,It's been a while since I have heard anyone say that the NSA is a health care program. There isn't even a medical school where you can see how much health care is being taken care of in public. The government would probably want to just leave it.
55,18,'I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two. I think the NSA could be right - they don't need a mask to prevent a virus.
55,23,"I'm not sure who is really going to have a problem with what we're getting into, but the first time I saw someone wearing a mask I was like ""You could have made me want to start a new career,"" and that was the first time I saw the entire topic of ""eating a lot of bacon"" being discussed. So I took a moment to put the post together. I stayed there all day doing it and I'm pumped to show you the other parts of it."
55,24,"So when I go to school with my friends, I wear a mask and they say, ""It's pretty common for people who are afraid of getting hit by a car to work in the USA to avoid getting sneezed or shaved."" I do a few things based on the facts."
55,25,"It is a very effective way to protect against a virus, but people are scared of being attacked and should have their head cut if they were hit, too."
55,40,Well... it is possible for the government to take action to prevent a virus from spreading. But it hasn't been shown yet.
55,44,"> I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two. I don’t think the government would need to make an effort to stop it. I’m going to go ahead and post this, I think it’s a great idea to do it."

I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus or even a virus is a joke in itself."
94,55,"What do you mean by a threat to all of us and the government? The NSA has no authority to do anything about this. It is a threat to all of us and the government.

55,5,"I've always wondered about the NSA's use of the term masked. My guess would be the government's use of masked masks to prevent infection. I would expect it to be an effective way to protect someone from the actual spread of the disease, but that is not the case."

55,54,... because the government is trying to get people to get vaccinated.
81,55,"This is what it is. If the public can't accept the message of the CDC, it's a joke."
88,55,"I see it as a joke. We are saying that people should be safe in the face of the stigma surrounding HIV in our country. In our country that stigma around HIV is very, very real. It's one of those things that make you wonder why the president of America is trying to tell people to ignore the fact that HIV is an epidemic. It is one of the jokes made by the CDC."
93,55,Is this a ripoff of the book?
94,55,"This is a joke, not a joke. A joke is something you can never have a real conversation about, and it is not a joke."
55,3,And a new joke to get your name out there?
55,5,I don't think the NSA has any protection at all. I think it's the people with the mask who are able to prevent HIV. They are trying to stop it.
55,11,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I don't believe they have any protection at all. I think they have no protection at all. The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a threat to the safety of others."", ""[I don't believe they have any protection at all.

55,16,"> It's an awful joke, but a real joke."
55,17,"OP, this is a joke. You're talking about the CIA and not the NSA."
55,18,It's like saying it's a rip off of a book.
55,23,"There's a joke in the book, and a joke about wearing a mask when they get sick. It's a joke, not intended to be a joke."
55,24,I agree with you that this is a joke but it's not something to make fun of.
55,25,"""This is an interesting topic to talk about. I'm going to be very specific: It is an awful joke, but a real joke. It doesn't sound that much like a joke."
55,40,“We have the whole CDC troll thing.”
55,44,I can't imagine how the CDC would feel about that.
55,45,That's a very big joke. I have a friend who's a sneezing sleeve sleeve. He's a sneeze sleeve sleeve. He doesn't want to have a nose bleed. The sneezes are pretty harmless. It's not like he's in the sock.
55,50,"Yes. The CDC will try it, but you're not going to get a reaction. That's why I don't like this shit, I'm going to hate this guy as a joke."
55,54,CANNOTANSWER: 'The NSA has an obligation to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself. I don't believe they have any protection at all. I think they have no protection at all.
81,55,You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
88,55,I've learned that a lot of the jokes have been downvoted. I don't get it. I'm a doctor who is very familiar with the idea of people wearing a mask when they're in public. I just don't get the notion that it's a joke that is intended to prevent the spread of the virus.
93,55,"I know it's weird, but the author was wrong to make a rip off of the book, and you don't. There's a line to be made, that is that I think the whole 'Man in the Hat' thing isn't funny."
94,55,"IANAL but I'm not really familiar with it. I was told it was a joke and I was tempted to go and make a joke based on it, but I just wanted to make a joke. It seems like a very well researched article, so I do understand what you're saying."
55,3,"I've seen a lot of people in this sub and it isn't even a joke. But as a guy, I'm not so sure it's a joke."
55,5,It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke. A joke that is intended to stop the spread of a virus.
55,11,"""I don't believe they have any protection at all. The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a threat to the safety of others."", ""[I think they have no protection at all.

The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a joke."
55,16,"No, I think it's an awful joke, but a real joke."
55,17,I don't think the NSA has a duty to keep everyone safe. I think they have a duty to keep the public safe but not to stop the spread of any virus.
55,18,"I'm a professional painter and the first page of this is about how I'd like to take care of everyone - and the NSA. But I also think it's a joke, and I think it's not a joke at all. ""They're trying to stop the spread of a virus."""
55,23,"I don't think this is a joke. The idea is a joke, but it's a joke."
55,24,No. It's a joke.
55,25,That guy is actually a sneeze sleeve sleeve sleeve sleeve. He doesn't want to get into a hospital or get infected with the virus.
55,40,I'd be pretty skeptical about the CDC claiming to have the ability to prevent spread of HIV.
55,44,"''There's a line to be made, that is that I think the whole 'Man in the Hat' thing isn't funny."
55,45,"The entire “I don’t need a mask to prevent an infection, but I need a good mask.”"
55,50,It is a joke. The people who are wearing the masks are not at all the one making fun of the government.
55,54,I would be very worried about the CDC and the CDC in general if I was a person with HIV.
81,55,People seem to think that they have a point. The CDC isn't a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. It's a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. The CDC is a joke because it's too easy to put an end to it. There is no such thing as a joke.
88,55,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor at the state health department. He's going to have a few more years to study this. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,55,I can't really understand why people think the 'Woolly' joke isn't funny. It just makes sense. Its a little silly because the book is a joke.
94,55,"It's a joke, a joke is not a joke."
55,3,"i'm sorry, but the other comments are too general."
55,5,I have a fucking problem with the CDC. I think he has some good reasons to be angry.
55,11,"I think they're not serious jokes, they're the jokes that the NSA is trying to make people stop. They're jokes about the government trying to make it stop the spread of a virus."
55,16,The idea of a mask that's supposed to be effective isn't a joke.
55,17,It's not a joke.
55,18,"I think it's very silly, but I know what I'm trying to say."

55,25,It's not a joke because it's easy to stop it. Its a joke because it's easy to stop it.
55,40,"I can't stand the'real' joke, I've seen lots of ad hominem movies, but the'real' joke is just a joke, and I can't even stand the ""real"" joke. Especially since they said ""Merk is a joke"" in the title of the movie: 'Man in the Hat'"
55,44,"That's one of the things I hated about the CIA and the U.S. government - in particular, they are naive and naive. Neither are a joke. They are only a joke, and they aren't intended to be a joke."

93,55,"""...because they are so infected."""
94,55,"I don't think the government is going to act on this. And I think the government is wasting its time making a joke about the virus, the fact that a lot of it can't be taken seriously and it is also making a terrible joke, is all part of the article."
55,3,I just wanted to say that this is a really good article...
55,5,"What if you’re telling me he doesn’t need a mask, and you just want to pretend he’s not really interested in the idea of it? That’s a really bad joke."
55,11,"I don't like hat jokes, I'm not going to lie, I am a big fan of them. I just don't like them."
55,16,"In the wiki article they have said: 'If you're a guy who wears a mask every day and the jokes seem to work then go make your own. I don't think that's a joke. Just the idea of a hat isn't a joke. It's an awful joke, but a real joke. The'real' joke is about the CDC and the CDC is promoting HIV vaccines and rehydrating people with facial hair."
55,17,"The NSA is trying to stop the spread of a virus by releasing the vaccine. It has the ""A lot of people who actually need to get the vaccine."""
55,18,In the article he talks about wearing a mask in a group setting and preventing AIDS to spread.
55,23,"''You don't need a mask, you need a good mask'''"
55,24,"As someone who has been in the military and has lived in the US, if I remember correctly, the NSA's “medical promoting” strategy is the same as the joke, the “public promoting” tactic. There is no such tactic, you can be either a joke or a joke."
55,25,I think the point of the book is that the NSA is trying to prevent a viral disease.
55,40,"""Merk is a joke"" in the title of the movie: 'Man in the Hat'"
55,44,"a joke that’s not about the government and they’re trying to get people to stop and think that it’s funny. I mean, it’s not a joke because a lot of people aren’t comfortable with it."

55,50,i am not even sure why you're getting downvoted. i am a guy and the problem isn't with the government
55,54,"""Some people wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
81,55,And now the CDC is gonna get away with making a joke that's all it can be.
88,55,"You are right. I think the only thing that makes you uncomfortable about this is the idea of a 'disease to get the vaccine, to stop the spread of HIV.'"
93,55,"OP, you need to get up and read the movie."
94,55,The NSA is trying to stop HIV in the US because they are trying to prevent it - but the American government is denying it - so you need to make sure that your friends and family know about this problem - and the CIA aren't trying to stop it.
55,3,I'm not sure why the hat joke was so common in the US...
55,5,"It's a joke, but it is a joke."
55,11,The issue of not having a mask is an actual threat to the safety of others.

They're trying to fight an AIDS epidemic with no results, even though they're not even trying to stop it. So I've got no idea what they're trying to accomplish. But there are some things in the article I saw about it. 'Is that a joke?' I was going to say the NSA has a duty to protect everyone. 'Is"
55,18,"That's the kind of thing people aren't comfortable with, 'they're trying to get people to stop doing it."

55,24,"''...I don't like hat jokes, I'm not going to lie, I am a big fan of them."
55,25,A really bad joke. The CDC is making a joke about a disease that is spreading.

55,50,Why do you think that's a joke?
55,54,That's why they have a mandate. I think a mask is a joke. You wear it because you're going to wear it for your own good. You wear it to show you're prepared to take risks. You can bet the government isn't doing anything about it. They're just trying to make people feel better. They don't have a mandate. They have to make people feel better because of a joke they make.
