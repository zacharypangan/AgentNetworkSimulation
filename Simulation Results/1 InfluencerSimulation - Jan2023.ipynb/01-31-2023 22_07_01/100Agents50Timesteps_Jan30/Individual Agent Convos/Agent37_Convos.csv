58,37,"I'm not sure if it is a valid point of view but in the eyes of the American people and our government, I'm inclined to think wearing a mask helps to reduce the spread of a virus. I'm interested in seeing what we can do to reduce the spread of a virus."

I don't see the point here that anyone is getting a free pass for people who aren't aware of their own medical conditions, and isn't doing anything at all.

65,37,I'm going to say to you that I think people wear masks to stop the spread of a virus.
73,37,"The guy was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown. But I understand that the statewide mask mandate doesn't apply here in Texas. They're making it so that the government cannot infringe on their pedophilia."
79,37,I'm a very cautious person and I really don't understand why we're so scared. I've always been scared of the idea of people trying to get in in front of me.
80,37,"My father was going to a doctor recently with a virus that he got from the virus. He asked me to help him and the doctor told him to do the same thing. He said a mask was just not enough to stop a virus, just tries to spread it. The doctors didn't do it, but it was a very effective way to stop a virus from spreading."
85,37,"That is not a good point. If it's an actual point, 'I have to wear a mask on my birthday' is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,2,I don't think the article is really on the point.
37,4,Unless there's a way to circumvent the government's control of the world.
37,10,"What's funny about the phrase, ""I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."" I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."

51,37,A man with a mask is a medical doctor who is going to eat shit because he has HIV and isn't even sure he can wear a mask.
58,37,I'd think wearing a mask against the spread of a virus would be a good idea.
65,37,"It’s only been three months, but there’s a big difference between the time it takes to wear a mask, and when you’re in a situation where your skin isn’t healing properly. You’re wearing a mask to make the doctor’s job easier, but if you’re worried that your skin isn’t responding to the proper care, you should really go to a doctor."
73,37,"He is saying that ""It's not about the pedophilia, it's about the fact that there is a problem in Texas with a mask. But I think it should be better."""
79,37,I was in this state a few years ago and got a little concerned when someone jumped in to talk about the CDC's recent effort to help the government. I don't think we could afford to do anything.
80,37,People get fucked when their government gets their face out and they're doing something that can't be done.
85,37,Is there a way to stop the spread of HIV by having people go to the doctor in Florida?
37,2,The article said that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,4,I think he's thinking of doing a mask when the health care system isn't working. That's the point. It would be better for the government to have you go to the doctor and see if there's anything you can do to stop the spread of the disease.
37,10,He can't afford a mask that makes him a tyrant for being a tyrant.
37,12,">I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."" I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."
37,13,"The article is not true. That doesn't mean he isn't an asshole. I mean, if this guy isn't really in it for the sake of health, he would just be an asshole."
37,20,So what do you expect to get from the article? A man who wears a mask is a doctor who is going to eat shit because he has HIV and isn't even sure he can wear a mask. Is there a way to stop the spread of HIV by having people go to the doctor in Florida?
37,24,I'm sure it could be one of the best he's been for quite some time. This is a blatant scam that only a handful of states can be responsible for.
51,37,I have never heard of the CDC saying the first time I have a virus a doctor must be wearing a mask for the first time. The CDC can't just tell me why he's wearing a mask and then they go away because it's not funny.
58,37,"We have to go to the doctor and have him give him a full dose of THC, and we also have to be able to wear a mask."
65,37,I think wearing a mask in public is a lot of shit.

79,37,[FACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FACT): People who don't realize they're wearing a mask at work or at home or work.
80,37,You're referring to the way doctors and medical professionals have to treat people. They get a warning from the government that they have no idea what a virus is and that they have no compulsion to get it. In fact they're doing so to protect those people who have symptoms.
85,37,I've walked out of my apartment with a black and white hud. I've had a phlegm infection and was in a wheelchair. I was scared for a minute.
37,2,"The fact that he wears a mask for the first time at work is a major warning sign, especially given how many people are living with this disease. It is extremely immoral and is not appropriate to do so at all. It is a real problem, but that is what he is doing, not his job. Especially if the job is to protect people like yourself."
37,4,"IANAL, but it seems like this guy is a phony, a slob of the gov't. He's trying to tamper with the reality, and there's no real evidence that he's making an attempt to stop it."
37,10,"[Staff here: A man who wears a mask in his job, and it's a great way to stay calm. I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."
37,12,The story is one of the worst I've read about people who haven't seen the CDC on screen.
37,13,"Honestly I'd be VERY surprised if this article were true, and that's a fairly small sample size. Those are not the type of cases where you're going to get a warning."
37,20,The government is not helping people like me.

You’re wearing a mask to make the doctor’s job easier, but if the patient isn’t healing properly, that’s the point"
51,37,I was thinking of some things and saw it was an unsatisfactory joke. This is pretty common.
58,37,"...But I'm trying to figure out how to keep people from getting infected. I need to start using the word ""hobby."" Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
65,37,"It doesn't make sense to say ""I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."""
73,37,I'm a member of the national guard.
79,37,"Unless you're a fan of all the anti-HIV groups who want to change the world, the idea that it's the CDC doesn't fit the purpose of the government is a huge red flag.... the government doesn't care about AIDS, nor does it care about HIV or any of the other health care providers."
80,37,"My doctor and I always wear the mask when we go out. I never see the virus, but he's not saying that a mask is the best way to stop a virus, just that it's a very effective way to keep people safe."
85,37,"It's called a ""police-shaming"" sub. It's very useful to note that people who wear a mask all the time don’t realise they are wearing it when running through public places."
37,2,I would think that the article was snarky and that he is trying to tamper with the reality.
37,4,"The guy has an agenda and needs to take action. A person's innate desire to change their own world will help him to change it. The CDC will then give him a chance to go after you. If he's making a decision about something, he'll probably stop a change of course."
37,10,"IANAL, but it seems like this guy is a phony, a slob of the government."
37,12,"He doesn't have to wear the mask. They don't have to have it on. This is the worst news I've read so far. He seems like a phony, a slob."
37,13,"The CDC is putting too much emphasis on preventing infections, and the anti-viral groups are putting too much emphasis on preventing them. So, what's the problem? They don't care if people in hospitals are infected. They're just saying that they can do better, and that people aren't actually being infected."
37,20,"I've never seen the CDC, and haven't been able to find any data that supports this. I'm pretty sure there are some in the U.S. - you'll find a lot of these stories :"
37,24,"Yes, that's really weird. There isn't any actual evidence, he was trying to make a joke based on the article and the article itself. He's not trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's more the fact that he is trying to make a joke based on the article that he is trying to make, rather than the fact that he is trying to tamper with the reality, and that he's trying to make a joke."
51,37,"In all likelihood, they're not just saying they're illegal, they're saying they're trying to make it illegal, so they have a right to make a joke that's unsatisfactory."

65,37,No! It's not a joke! It's a joke!
73,37,So the guy is wearing a mask?
