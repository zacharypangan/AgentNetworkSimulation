I'm sure there are a lot of people that have been vaccinated and who actually want them.

Regardless, it's a joke. A friend of mine who wears a mask at a party does it because it's comfortable. It's not a joke, it's a joke.",
    "I think a lot of things have changed in the last 3 years, such as how people grew up in places like America where people wore masks to fight against HIV.

    "I don't really think it is a joke if we're talking about the actual health risks posed by HIV that we know are sexist in our society. There is no way to prove that someone is sexist in some way. People who wear masks and talk about their phobias are the same people who don't wear masks because they're not afraid of being infected. There are many more jokes about how they want to spread HIV in a manner that's very much not a joke.",
