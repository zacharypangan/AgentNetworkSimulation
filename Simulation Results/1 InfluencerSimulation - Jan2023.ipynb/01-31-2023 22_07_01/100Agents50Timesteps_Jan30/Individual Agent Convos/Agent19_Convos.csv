76,19,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

19,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
19,12,So this is what a politician who is just an old man in an old house wearing a face mask will say:
19,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
19,16,> Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
21,19,>I am going to go run on a run on a run on the road. I am going to walk on the road.

39,19,"That's awesome! I'm actually trying to get this post up. I'm in Florida, and i'm a little embarrassed to be doing this!"
52,19,I have a friend who has a virus that is not gone and she would like to wear a mask. Despite the fact that she doesn't wear a mask.
58,19,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
61,19,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,19,...that would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
66,19,So he needs to go to a museum to look for a mask?
68,19,i think the reason why people don't wear a mask is because it makes people uncomfortable
76,19,"I don't know how to do this, but I'm not in the US, and I have a huge health insurance claim for the CDC."
83,19,"You should wear a mask for a mile or more to stay safe from infectious diseases, like a flu, a heart attack or anything else that you may need to get checked out of surgery."
84,19,"You r a man in a mask, you r a man in a mask, you r a man in a mask, you r a man in a mask. That’s right, you r a man in a mask."
86,19,It's a mask. It's a mask. It protects from viruses.

19,11,"You don't need a mask to protect from a virus. A lot of people would not be comfortable putting on a mask and have a fever if they didn't have a mask. A more logical explanation is that the government is taking the vaccines and vaccines, and they're not putting on any kind of kind of protection against the spread of the virus. That's why a lot of people wear a mask."
19,12,i don't understand why people don't wear masks
19,14,"As an avid outdoorsman, I've noticed that a lot of people don't wear a mask anymore, especially if they're getting a flu."

32,19,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
39,19,I am going to say a second sentence:
52,19,"I have an extremely nasty cold. And my friend is infected with it too, so I'm wearing a mask every day to keep her warm."
58,19,"OP, are you sure you don't agree with the helmet policy? Or are you just surprised it doesn't mention a mask?"
61,19,I wear a mask for the holidays and it makes me feel better - and I'm pretty embarrassed.
63,19,I'd rather have a white Christmas sweater than a mask on. I feel I have the right to wear it.
66,19,This is actually good advice for the guy who vaccinates his children and also encourages him to have his kids vaccinate. Vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus.
68,19,"That's not a proper mask. A mask doesn't help prevent a virus from spreading, it doesn't stop it from spreading. It's a mask that protects you from it. And it's also part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of the virus."
76,19,"I'm not sure how to do that, but I'm on a big health insurance claim for the CDC. Wearing a mask can not prevent a virus from spreading, but it can help reduce the spread of that virus. If you don't get it, you will get an infection that could spread."
83,19,"I don't know what a mask would be, but it's not like there was a mask on anywhere near the coast of Florida. It's supposed to be a protection device for runners who get sick, but don't wear it in a public location if you run in a crowded environment. If it weren't for that, it would have been a much more serious, more invasive, way safer than a mask in tight settings."
84,19,"I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask, I am a man in a mask. I am a man in a mask."
86,19,"There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines. I know that it's quite often not true, but it can be done with a few simple ideas. For instance, one person with a vaccine can wear a mask to prevent infected adults from being rabid or infected."
89,19,"I hate to say it but I like to wear a mask if it does not stop the spread of a virus. I hate to say that sucks, but there's some truth to it."

19,12,Having to be covered in a mask will protect me from getting a virus.
19,14,"I have to go to school now because I was too old to wear a mask. I wore a hat and a hat every day. Having no hat and no hat is going to make me a worse person. I've had a severe cold and still have a lot of fun going to school, and it hurts to get the hood up. I feel like I should have a shirt if I could get a new one for Halloween. I don't care how well I feel about it, I'm a man in a mask."
19,16,They have said a lot of good things about wearing a mask:
21,19,I see why people are assuming a lot of it is a response to the question.
32,19,"I am a huge covid, but my mother is not."
39,19,"What is the name of this subreddit you're referring to? OP, 'Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic', ""That's awesome! I'm actually trying to get this post up. I'm in Florida, and i'm a little embarrassed to be doing this!"","

58,19,I snorted the bomb for like a week. I was worried.
61,19,I'd love to wear a mask in public and in the hospital to protect others.
63,19,The CDC is using information to stop the spread of a virus.
66,19,I would be terrified of having a virus on my hand if I ran a half marathon there and there was no one there... I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban.
68,19,"The government... ""in the world, we vaccinate every person who wants us to, because we can prevent a bunch of diseases which could get in the way of our health and safety."
76,19,I don't think anyone is recommending the use of the CDC or their vaccines as a means to prevent people from spreading a virus.
83,19,"...but I do trust the government. I believe in the masked system and the government will do a great job of making the public aware of it. They need to have their own way of trying to protect themselves, but there is only so much that's available."
84,19,"""The public should be concerned. As long as they are not a threat to people of color and don't eat people who are in danger of getting HIV, the government won't do anything about it."""
86,19,"a mask is a mask, and it's not only designed to protect you but it protects you against all the invading viruses that are spread in the country. scleroscopes are supposed to protect you but they are designed to not protect against infection. the one that is going to be tested for the disease is a mask."
89,19,I like to wear a mask when I can go out to public and do it during my day off.
90,19,I would love to do this with a friend and tell them to'stay away from the mask' and let them feel bad about it

19,12,It's not a joke.
19,14,I didn't realize this sub was talking about a virus. It's a little out of date. I'm also not sure why people are assuming it's just a joke.
19,16,They are trying to get a lot of people to stop the spread of a virus. This is not a joke. They want to stop the spread of a virus. They want to stop the spread of a virus.
21,19,"I thought that if the government did something to stop the spread of AIDS, and did it as they did, then people could actually make a profit from it."
32,19,My mom always wears a mask when she's out in public and that would never stop her from getting sick.
39,19,"I read that the first thing he said was about the lack of a definition of vaccination. The AMA was a big piece of shit. Is that just a joke? :P Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
52,19,"A couple weeks ago, my husband did a video with a man who was at the hospital. He told the hospital that it was really cool and wanted to take the man home but couldn't because he wore his mask in the middle of the run. He said it was just too cold for him to be wearing his mask at the time."
58,19,"I was about to say something like, ""Oh you have the right to wear a mask but we don't have the right to wear a mask."""
61,19,"If you don't want to be a child, don't do it. This is the kind of humor that makes a joke that isn't funny at all. It isn't funny at all."
63,19,"I've seen it. It's the best one I've seen in a while. The reason I don't like it is because it's the kind of movie that keeps it so long. That's a huge reason why I like it. I like the movie, but I don't get what a whole lot of people would like it."
66,19,In that case I'd be really scared. You're a fucking prick.
68,19,"It's almost like someone said: ""We have to wear a mask""...which is a common joke. You don't have to wear a mask, you just have to wear an Oval and a helmet."
76,19,"The post is very misleading. The purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the spread of a virus. It is not inherently a bad thing, just is. You are causing problems with your body, not his. So why did you come in with the virus? Isn't there a place in your city where you could put it in? I have no idea. You can get it for free on medcd. I don't think anyone is recommending the use of the CDC or their vaccines as a means to prevent people from spreading a virus."

52,19,A med student at a pharmacy... they did a quick research and got some good information that you could use to get people to wear masks in the middle of their runs.
58,19,"This is a good question for a public health professional. I'm a vaccinationist, but I can't really say I'd agree with it, since I've heard people think that wearing a mask does help stopping the spread of a virus, but it's what prevents a person from being infected - a mask isn't really a mask."

66,19,">Hey, I'm gonna wear a turban and get a virus. I haven't seen the CDC tests in weeks, 'cause I think they've done so well, and I'm hoping that will keep them in a bit longer."
68,19,"That's a joke. You don't have to wear a mask, you just have to wear a mask."
76,19,It's really very disturbing that it is so blatantly implied that there is a certain level of risk of spreading an HIV virus.
83,19,"I've heard the saying. “People who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings” and “you have to wear a mask on a run. That's nice of you!” There is an article on this subreddit, ""Hey, I just saw you are running miles across Florida right now. hey i just saw you are running miles across Florida right now.” and it is just a joke."

32,19,This doesn't seem to be a big deal. I'd suggest you check your local state government's website for this information. The government's website says the CDC will investigate this and then if there's a problem with a mask it's likely they'll find a solution.
39,19,I can't even begin to comprehend how it makes any sense to say that they are just trying to do a joke about a bad joke that the CDC wasn't going to do.
52,19,"In Texas, everyone needs to know about the problem. The doctors who know how to prevent pandemics cannot simply use that information. It's the only 'fucking' reason people do that and they're afraid."
58,19,[It is a shame that a public health provider and their own physicians don't have a job that focuses on preventing the spread of a virus.

84,19,As a mother of 3 I think that it is possible to stop HIV from spreading but it is also possible for the government to help you. I don't see how this is a good way to communicate with her...
86,19,This is why the CDC doesn't provide vaccines. Vaccines are pretty common and are supposed to help prevent TB.
89,19,"YAY, TIL."
90,19,"I don't know why people are so vocal about it. I think they should use the word ""shockwaves""."

19,12,"I'm not a big fan of the AMA, but this article is very much on the topic of avoiding HIV. It's also on the front page of The Hollywood Reporter / /r/tea-shy-joke. It's a 'fucking AMA' and that's it."

83,19,Vaccines are legal. They aren't required. They are not. But it is illegal. Vaccines are not. And they aren't required.
84,19,"So, you don't know what a ""mask mandate"" is? What a funny line."
86,19,"> I've been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind."
89,19,I have a LOT of the same thoughts you have about the world.
90,19,"I wear a mask to stop people from fapping me while in my mask. This is the sort of thing the NSA says in an interview about the CDC. ""This is not something we should be ashamed of."""

19,11,"""I wear a mask to stop people from fapping me while in my mask."""
19,12,The film was written about the issue of avoiding HIV and the danger of having a childhood infection. It was written by a man who was trying to prevent it from spreading. He said that wearing a mask is the most important and important part of the prevention of HIV.
19,14,"Is the AMA a joke? AMA isn't a joke, it is a fact."
19,16,"I know that I don’t want to get a mask, but it would make sense for me to be mad at the AMA. The AMA is pretty good, especially as a comic."
21,19,"In the US, a person's right to wear a mask during a pandemic is a right to wear it as a matter of privacy."
32,19,Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. The NSA is doing nothing about it. Because he's being a complete nutjob.
39,19,That's the simplest answer you can get: Vaccines are for life. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
52,19,I'm not a doctor. I'm a GP. And I've never gotten sick.
58,19,"The term ""comprehensive health professional"" is actually ""whore-spinning"" if you mean the type of person you're asking people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe. Basically, it's just not a question."

63,19,"I'm not a doctor, but I still like the movie, and the CDC isn't doing anything about it."
66,19,"The fact that it's being trolled is not a racist or a joke, it is just the government's incompetence in dealing with it."

76,19,> The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus.
83,19,Vaccines aren't legal and they aren't. But it isn't required. Vaccines aren't. And they aren't required.
84,19,Having an HIV infection is one thing and a mask is another. I'm a man in a mask. But I also do not think it's a bad idea to tell your mother or a friend. I can't believe the government is trying to make it illegal.
86,19,I'd say this is a joke because if it were a joke it would probably be an issue. I don't think it would be funny but it would be a good idea.
89,19,"I don't care if they're trying to make money from me or not, it's not a joke. If they are trying to keep their own money I wouldn't be using it if I were working with a company."
90,19,"It is a joke. I think they should use the word ""shockwaves"" and ""what it says is not something we should be ashamed of."""
95,19,"No, I don't think it's a joke. It's just an asshole joke. A joke about how most people get vaccinated when they are young is a resounding no, because the government isn't actually helping their children get the vaccines and aren't actually doing anything about that."
19,11,"In order to make that AMA funny, I'm going to be honest with you. There are a ton of people in my group that are just as afraid of the possibility of HIV spread as the AMA, even though they all think that the government is trying to help with HIV."

66,19,"As a CDC neurologist and doctor I’ve always thought the government is a good place to help prevent the spread of HIV, they have to be pretty vigilant, and have a lot of research done before we even make assumptions. The joke is really funny and not racist, it really is just part of the campaign against the government."
68,19,What's funny is that we have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of the virus.
76,19,You know I think your comment is misleading and that this is what the CDC wants you to think.
83,19,"If you don't wear a mask, you won't be able to afford the medical expenses. That's a problem for the CDC."
84,19,"I have a feeling that this is just one of those things that is a bit of an itch. There are only a couple of things I can stand to do today, and I think it is all about a great attitude."
86,19,"> ""I'm just going to get a little messy with my hand. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
89,19,"In the words of the person who wrote it, it sounds like the word ""Jack"" comes from the word slang."
90,19,"A prank is a joke, a joke that isn't actually true or funny, a joke that's not funny or funny at all."
95,19,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
19,11,"People in general don't realize the dangers of HIV, they just know it's a threat. People who don't know the dangers of the vaccines don't know what it is. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick."
19,12,I don't understand how people are so uncomfortable putting on a mask? I think you need to wear your mask to prevent the spread of HSVM? The fact that it's a joke and not a joke is a bit ridiculous.
19,14,You think a hsvm movie or any other medical show has a good joke to it? Or you think it's a funny movie?
19,16,"I have some sexist issues. I am on a drug, which is a very serious disease and will be affected by a lot of things."
21,19,"People just get so embarrassed at the sarcastic jokes that they start telling them in AMAs like ""Is there a problem with being a doctor if it is not legal?"""
32,19,"I'd recommend checking your local state government's website for this information. The CDC's website says the AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke, and it is a joke. I think it's a big deal."
39,19,I don't know if you read the link but I can understand how people who do not know that the joke is a joke. They're being sarcastic and joking /
52,19,"I don't want to tell you what's going on, but I think it's a rip off. I know the CDC is trying to help people but don't want to go out of their way to do a bad job, and it's a joke."
58,19,"I don't think it's going to be a joke, because this is a joke. It's supposed to prevent the spread of a virus, so you are just putting on a mask."
61,19,"It's kind of like an AMA to the NSA about it, a real gimmick."
63,19,No one here thinks that the CDC is a joke because of a virus that is on the ground.
66,19,"People think that the joke is racist because they say it’s racist, because it’s not racist."
68,19,I would get over it. I haven't heard of the AMA. It's like a joke with some jokes.
76,19,This is one of the reasons why you are being cliched.
83,19,It's a joke. A joke is a joke.
84,19,Is it a joke? I know it's a joke. Is it a joke.
86,19,This isn't about vaccination. This is about vaccination and not about the world.
89,19,I'm sorry I can't read.
90,19,I feel bad for those who don't want to be the first one to ask this.
95,19,"And the kids who get vaccinated at 15 are often referred to as ""jimmies."""
19,11,There is also a lot of humor in it. A fucking AMA in a sports arena.
19,12,"I'm going to say, AMA's aren't the joke they're looking for."
19,14,This is not about being a joke.
19,16,> I’m going to be honest with you. Why the hell do I wear a mask? I’m sorry.’
21,19,"AMA participant, I don't think it is a joke to ask what other people are saying about the fact that this is a ripoff of the book."
32,19,"That's the kind of joke that makes people want to go to a doctor and say the doctors are narcissistic, but they're not right. It's a joke."
39,19,No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No
52,19,You've never seen a funny AMA? This is why the US government is acting like a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,19,"I like to think that the joke is about government policies, which it is."
61,19,"So I'm not saying that this is a joke, but the point that you make is that the CDC isn't doing anything about it. This isn't a joke, a joke, but this is a joke. I think that there's a lot of sexist jokes on the internet that the CDC is trying to do to stop HIV. This is what the CDC wants. And I hope you have a great day!"
63,19,"It's a funny movie, I don't get it."
66,19,"It’s a joke, but the problem is that people have no real idea what it’s about."
68,19,I don't like this AMA. It's a joke. It's just a joke. It's a joke.
76,19,"It's not ""just a great idea for people to wear unless you want to get vaccinated."""
83,19,A joke is a joke. A good joke isn't a joke. It's a joke.
84,19,"I think the real question here is if it is a joke because it seems a rip off or is a ripoff of the book. That is a big, cliched joke that you probably don't even know what it is."
86,19,It's about the CDC and the world's population. I’m just hoping the AMA makes a difference. It may not be funny but it's not a joke.
89,19,The fact that it is used as a means of protecting is a bit of an understatement.
90,19,"if you wear a mask you don't get the idea that a prank is a joke, it doesn't mean they're a joke. It means they are not a joke, and they don't think it's funny, so they think it's a joke."
95,19,"That’s a joke, but it's not just a joke, it’s a joke."
19,11,People who don't know what is dangerous to get a TB vaccine.
19,12,It is funny and sexist and it is a good idea. Is it a joke? Then they won't change it.
19,14,"Its an absurd joke. You don't want to know what the movie is about, you just don't want to know what the story is about."
19,16,““It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.”
21,19,It sounds like a real joke.
32,19,"This is a little opportunistic. It's all kind of ridiculous. I am going to start thinking about how to use the phrase ""I would rather buy a mask for myself, especially if the part of the movie said something like that, but I'm going to assume this is what people will be able to handle."" because I'm going to start thinking about it. I also want to think about if I can help the people who need to be able to prevent it, because I know they're being a prank. This isn't "
39,19,"What's funny is the AMA. It seems to be about vaccination. It doesn't really say ""but we do need to get vaccinated""."
52,19,It's a joke.
58,19,I don't understand that this is a joke. It's just a joke. The AMA is based on a wiki article. It's a joke.
61,19,I think I've made the wrong assumptions here.
63,19,"[NAME] is a fictional fictional story about an American apologist who made a hunch about the government using a mask to minimize the spread of the virus and that there are plenty of problems with that, including the CDC."
66,19,"So, the answer is that people who are not racist are a very racist bunch."
68,19,You read the whole thread and found out that the AMA is a joke. It's not that the AMA is a joke but that the AMA is a joke.
76,19,"This is a very long list of the things people need to do to keep the situation under control. You can say it in the title to keep that line short and direct, but that doesn't mean anything."
83,19,"That's actually not a joke, it's an absolute joke. You lied to me, and if you're not going to go to the doctor and get tested for a virus you're going to make a joke about yourself and your family. That's not a joke at all."
84,19,"It seems that the idea of a mask mandate is not just ""I hate to say it, but I've not been sick or had a serious illness so thats what I'm trying to say."""
86,19,"""You have a right to be vaccinated."""
89,19,"You are not the one who made the joke - if you say it's really that simple, it's actually quite simple."
90,19,What kind of jokes would a prank be?
95,19,The joke is just a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's only action.
19,11,It sounds to me like there is an extreme lack of humor in the AMA about preventing or preventing the spread of HIV. The only reason I can see that is because I've been to one and have not heard the AMA before.
19,12,"No matter how funny or sexist or sexist or racist a joke is, the most important thing is to keep the virus at bay. I'd eat a steak for the sake of that AMA."
19,14,"A lot of people don't know what a virus is and don't wear a mask anymore. I mean, some people just don't care and that's about it. I'd buy a hat for myself. I don't want people to wear it. I'd be a big help to people who don't know what a virus is and how to do that. I'd spend my time helping people who need to be vaccinated, and I'd spend time helping them. This is about a joke and it's about the government,"
19,16,“Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People who don’t know what is dangerous to get a TB vaccine.
21,19,It's a joke. It's a joke that's being made and is being a joke to those who don't really know how to use it. I don't think the joke is real but it just has to be done.
32,19,"It's a joke, but a joke. I think they're not doing it because they don't like it, they are just using it to keep people safe."
39,19,... because there's actually a link somewhere that states the government has not started any vaccinations as part of the AMA to prevent TB.
52,19,A joke? Totally. I just don't see it happening.
58,19,There is a lot of sexist stuff on this sub. It's a joke.
61,19,"I think I'm too smart to take the time to do this. I'm not a fan of the movie, but I see how people think this is a joke. They are rehashing all of the assumptions they make. They are trying to discourage vaccination."
63,19,"It's a funny movie, but I don't know how I am feeling. ""But I still like the movie, and the CDC isn't doing anything about it."","
66,19,"There are so many ways to communicate with a person, but in this case it's simply not appropriate for them to have the same conversation. And they are correct that the joke is not racist."
68,19,I have no idea why but I do have the right to ask for it.
76,19,It's kind of funny. I had a symptom of HIV and had to leave my job to find a new vaccination program. After that I went and found a different clinic and a new doctor. We got the same results and it worked!
83,19,"I am sorry, a lot of people have been hurt by such a bad joke, but a good part of it was not the actual joke."
84,19,It seems like the joke is being manipulated and it sucks because it is not.
86,19,What about a mask or a mask that prevents you from being bitten by an infected person from being bitten by an infected person?
89,19,The fact that it is used as a means of protecting is a bit of an understatement.
90,19,"The best thing people can do is wear a mask because it can stop the spread of a virus, or because it can help prevent a virus from getting spread through it."
95,19,The joke is a joke because it's a joke.
19,11,A sexist joke? Unless you're from an outside country.
19,12,I've been in several AMAs about this topic.
19,14,There's a lot going on there. It's just this one thing and it's pretty ridiculous.
19,16,"The only one I saw when I was in high school was a professor who told us all about wearing a mask and how they make people bleed like crazy. He was told they are making a joke and he told his friend that the ""fucking thing that stops a virus is going to make you bleed like a fucking monkey!"" joke. I guess he actually thought the AMA was a joke."
21,19,It isn't a joke. AIDS is more of a health issue than a serious issue.
32,19,You are making the right call.
39,19,"People are raping the government, and the government is making fun of them."
52,19,"I'm not sure where the phrase's ""This is not a joke"" comes from."
58,19,"It is a joke because the AMA is an attempt to stop the spread of a virus. I don't see any reason to call it a joke. AMAs are a good tool, but a joke."
61,19,I think they're not being funny. That's a great point.
63,19,"The AMA. There is absolutely no reason to disagree with it, because it is a bit of an insult."
66,19,Vaccines are not for life.
68,19,The AMA is a joke.
76,19,"Vaccines are for life, not just for people who don't have AIDS."
83,19,This is the logical conclusion of many books written by politicians:
84,19,"A mask mandate, in the sense that people are wearing masks, are not being used for the benefit of the government. They are simply informing people of how they're not allowed to use the mask in a way that is cliched. They are not informing anyone that it is being used in a manner that is dangerous to people of color or that they can get HIV. They are also warning everyone that their HIV status is a threat to the public. This is not going to help. It is going to help to spread viremia."
86,19,It's also an anti-vaccine joke. But what's the point of it?
89,19,I'm not sure why they're so critical of Obama but I'm not a huge fan of the CDC. There are plenty of people with a viral virus whose masks are wearing out.
90,19,"I read the title in a sarcastic tone. It seems to me that it was intended to be a joke, and it didn't say anything about a prank that would not be a joke."
95,19,I'm not saying that is not a joke. I'm saying it is a joke because it's funny because I don't care how the government acts. It's a joke because it's the government's only action. If you aren't a 'joke' then you aren't joking.
19,11,What do you think is the point of the AMA?
19,12,> I read the title in a sarcastic tone.
19,14,"I don't think it is a joke, I think it's a joke, not a fact."
19,16,AMAs aren't a joke. It's a fact.
21,19,"I think it's a joke, which is why this sub seems to be all about AMAs."
32,19,"I can say that a lot of people think ""I'm a joke because I'm a doctor."""
39,19,That is a joke that is a joke because the AMA is about a big piece of shit.
52,19,The article cites a CDC article that is about this being a rip off and a joke.
58,19,I don't even know what that means.
61,19,"I've never heard a sexist joke in person about people being vaccinated by a mask, but I heard that when people are saying people vaccinating themselves and they do it in public it can be considered a joke."
63,19,"... and you say something stupid to me about the AMA, a funny movie about a prankster who makes a hunch about a santa's AMA and a cyborg costume. ""I've seen it. It's the best one I've seen in a while. The reason I like it is because it's the kind of movie that keeps it so long."
66,19,"It is a joke, but it is not a joke. Vaccines are not for life."
68,19,The AMA apologises for making a sarcastic joke.
76,19,"Vaccines, though a serious issue, don't prevent a virus from spreading from the mouth. It's only a very limited way of doing it. You can't make it easier to get a virus. But it's a good idea. Vaccines are for everybody. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. People need to be vaccinated, but not for any other sex."
83,19,They have done a lot to control what people do in the USA. We just need to let them go.
84,19,"I think you're being a bit selfish, because I don't see how this would help. You know what I mean."
86,19,"""Is it possible that people are allergic to weed? It's a joke."", """"I'm just going to get a little messy with my hand. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."","", ""Is it possible that people are allergic to weed?"", ""I mean, if you know that is a joke, that's something AMA doesn't do."", ""What about a mask or a mask that prevents the virus, a joke,"" ""Is it"
89,19,"If you shave your face, it's fine. You have to wear the mask in order to prevent the spread of the virus. If you don't have time to do so, you have to wear a mask. You are not putting yourself in the position where you are sick because you've got the virus."
90,19,That's a joke.
95,19,You should be laughing at the joke here.
19,11,I'm gonna say that you're an asshole.
19,12,Vaccines are for people whose lives are in danger of getting sick from the sun. They are not just for people with HIV.
19,14,AMA isn't a joke.
19,16,"AMA is about people getting vaccinated, but not for other sex. It's about people getting vaccinated. AMA is about people getting vaccinated, but not for other sex. They have done a lot to control what people do in the USA. We just need to let them go."
21,19,AMA's. AMA's.
32,19,"I think the AMA is just a ripoff, and that this is about helping people."
39,19,AMAs are a joke. It is based on facts. I don't even know what they're about.
52,19,"I don't know where the phrase ""Jokes"" comes from, but that's it."
58,19,It's just a joke because it's a joke about the whole thing.
61,19,"You don't understand that it's a joke and that people are trying to discourage it because they are afraid to come across as a joke. They are just trying to do it in an attempt to help out the people with an illness, and in a sense they are being rehashing assumptions that they make."
63,19,"""The movie isn't overdue. It's overdue. The CDC isn't doing anything about it."","
66,19,I just can't see how the CDC is trying to bring down the real issue and make it sound like it's just a joke.
68,19,They are a joke and a joke is an AMA. They don't know how to handle this or if they do and would be very rude and not take the opportunity to apologize.
76,19,"The article says they were ""totally a joke""."
83,19,The US has more than enough government to pass a law requiring everyone to wear a mask than to wear a mask.
84,19,That's an insult. It's an insult.
86,19,It is a joke. But what is the point of this joke?
89,19,/u/RippleGayTimKen /r/WomenHappiness?
90,19,They're not funny when they aren't necessary to prevent a virus from spreading.
95,19,"""They're not going to stop the spread of a virus. I think it’s funny because it’s a joke because it’s the government’s only action."""
19,11,"AMA. No, they're not being funny based on anything else. The joke is that it is a joke that is more a joke because the people who watch it don't realize it's a joke. It's a joke that people are making to get vaccinated based on the fact that the vaccines have been withdrawn from people for a long time because of a virus. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's just a joke."
19,12,I like to get my hands on my mask every time I am in the meds
19,14,I was a member of the NVP.
19,16,"Why is the AMA about helping people? It's about helping people, not about making the world a joke."
21,19,"This is not a AMA, it is an attempt at a real joke. AMAs do not come from a specific source."
32,19,“There is a certain stigma that goes along with this.”
39,19,...the way they used the words you mentioned for a joke.
52,19,You a fucking stupid asshole.
58,19,AMA is a joke. People are talking about the government because it's a joke. People are talking about the government because it's a joke.
61,19,The CDC is in Texas because of a virus.
63,19,It's a cyborg movie that has all the elements of a joke and a comedy. It's an actual AMA and that's it.
66,19,Because the CDC is essentially trying to engulf the health and safety of the American public. And not just preventing it from spread. They're trying to make the people around them look like pigeons.
68,19,A joke. A joke. And a joke about something the government is doing to keep people from spreading the disease is a joke. It's not a joke.
76,19,What was the main difference between the masks and the sex hazard?
83,19,There are a couple of good ones if you're in the mood for something different.
84,19,"Those are the things I've always heard on this sub. Specifically, I think that the president of the CDC is joking in a way that doesn't involve inciting public outcry, or implying that he's a racist. I've also heard many joking in his book."
86,19,The AMA's point isn't to stop a virus but to get people to go to the hospital with the TB virus.
89,19,> Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,19,It’s a joke.
95,19,"Because people who think a joke is a joke are being silly, and some people think they're being funny."
19,11,It sounds like a joke. I can't really explain it.
19,12,"It's a joke because it's a joke, but a joke for them to make a joke about people that are afraid of being in public."
19,14,>What was the main difference between the masks and the sex hazard?
19,16,AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke.
21,19,i have seen so many sarcasm things from people that are trying to be funny
32,19,/r/raisedbyactors
39,19,"People have the right to say what they want, but if they can't tell, then it's not a joke."
52,19,This seems like an easy joke to me. It's not something the government is trying to make a joke about.
58,19,"''I snooped a week to see what a mask was like, but he wore a mask on a hospital visit.''"
61,19,"As a doctor, I can say that this joke was never made. The joke was only thrown around because the government was trying to make the situation better."
63,19,"I'm not a doctor, but I like AMA. And you like it?"
66,19,"The CDC is a joke, not a joke. I think it was an attempt to cover up the joke by making it appear that the government hasn't done anything. It was a joke and it's not about the CDC being incompetent. They're not doing anything."
68,19,"...and the AMA is just a joke. It's a joke, and it's not a joke."
76,19,"I think they're referring to the government in this case as the ""advisory body building "". They say it's a joke."
83,19,Vaccines are illegal in most countries.
84,19,...And I'm just saying that there's a lot to be done. And I'm just saying that there's a lot to be done. And I've always heard on this sub.
86,19,I believe the AMA is the latest addition to the AMA and is also a joke. It's a joke about the government ignoring it because it's supposed to help stop the spread of a virus.
89,19,"Is it just because the joke is about a person not being able to be in a good mood, or a funny one?"
90,19,"People can wear a mask, I see it as a good idea. Especially for someone like me who has a fever, not having a head or neck and shaved their hands. If it can't be a joke, I'd wear a mask, because I don't feel like a shit assistant."
95,19,"I don't know about the jokes, but the jokes are a joke. They aren't jokes, they are jokes."
19,11,"It sounds like the most popular and well received AMA is ""You wear a mask to protect from a virus"" (http://www.nih.gov/ama/context/discussions/whatsupposed-to-be-Viscos/Villa-Virus-Nature) which is written as a ""Mixture-In-a-Foot"" (Its been about the same for 5 years now)."
19,12,Vaccines are a joke.
19,14,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke, a joke, a joke. There are a lot of shite jokes here."
19,16,I think I read a witty statement about a joke.
21,19,I think this is a joke that is funny enough for people to genuinely care about it. It's not a joke because people don't want to believe it's a joke. It's a joke because it is a fucking joke.
32,19,Is this about the government using a clone that is not even a clone?
39,19,"I woke up last night feeling awful for a second. I told my husband, ""My friend said I'm a little embarrassed,"" and then told him ""I don't want a joke about vaccines."" And I've heard the first few things he said:"
52,19,">The problem with the article is that, for most people, it is just a joke. They aren’t being honest about the point."
58,19,"I'm not a doctor, but I've learned from doing so many times and even have the same symptoms. I don't even like the jokes. I just find them annoying and silly."
61,19,The story is actually about a guy who was in the CDC because he was getting a virus. He was wearing a mask in public and in a medical setting. The government is trying to stop it.
63,19,"Is it a joke or a prank? It is a prank. It is a prank, its a joke, and it is a joke."
66,19,The whole issue of the joke isn't about the government. The point of the joke is that people are not looking for a reason to feel uncomfortable or at the same place they have a problem. It's about the government being responsible for the spread of HIV.
68,19,> And I think you're trying to explain why it's a joke?
76,19,"I'm being cliche. This is not a joke, it's just the government being a joke."
83,19,"What are you getting at with these jokes? The answer is usually, ""yes, it is. I'm sick of that, but I'm not going to go get a vaccination."""
84,19,It's not the same as the other lines. It's a joke and is probably an actual joke.
86,19,"The AMA is supposed to protect the person who is sick, and to give the people who are sick enough to get vaccination."
89,19,"It's a joke, you know? I don't like it because it is a joke."
90,19,'Which is the worst way to prevent a virus?'

68,19,AMAs are just jokes. I think the best joke of all time was the one that he was the first to say the joke. Then I remembered a couple of the jokes he gave me.
76,19,"This is the third time I've ever had an episode of Dr. Fucks for the first time since the first episode of The Wire starring Michael Bay. I'm blown away. The first episode, at least, is like a week before it comes out. It's the only episode. Mostly because it is about a guy and a guy doing this shit to his girlfriend. But it is still a comedy. Then I saw this episode of The Wire where the CDC is discussing that is actually a joke. This seems like the first episode of The"
83,19,Vaccines are illegal in most countries because they aren't mandated by the government. Vaccines are legal. They aren't. But they aren't. And they aren't. And they aren't required.
84,19,"He's probably joking because he doesn't understand the importance of a mask. He's joking about the harms of a mask, but he's also joking about the effect of having a mask on the health of others in the health field.

19,16,I'm also pretty sure this joke is one of the reasons the CDC is in office.

39,19,I was referring to the fact that there was a link somewhere that said that vaccines are not effective because of what it was supposed to be about.
52,19,I don't think the CDC is a joke.

61,19,This is a joke. It's not a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because it's funny.

84,19,Isn't it just an advertisement. 'Making a mask' is not the same thing as using a mask. There are different versions of the mask mandate which are not legal.

19,14,"I've been trying to keep a tv show for a while and I find it rather embarrassing. But I'm glad people are talking about it. It's so sad to say what you're saying is nonsense, but I also can't believe they didn't actually mention it before."

52,19,"I am not saying they should stop it, but we do not know what the ""Joke"" is. I am saying they should stop doing it,'so that they aren't getting better.'"
58,19,The AMA is about the government trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,19,That's a lot of sexist jokes that are trying to stop HIV.
63,19,"I think the AMA, or maybe this one, is pretty good. I think this one is also funny in that the AMA is not about the vaccine. Its about the CDC's effort to get people to get it."
66,19,The joke isn't racist. The joke is about the CDC trying to get people vaccinated. But it's not racist because they think it's racist.
68,19,"I feel like this isn't a joke. A joke is simply a joke aimed at helping people with their own phobias and mental problems. It's not intended to be an attempt to make people feel comfortable, and it's not intended to be a dick joke, rather than a way to help people to feel safe and at least educate them."
76,19,I'm not really sure whether the CDC or the CDC is going to take anything further.

86,19,"Because the AMA is about people getting vaccinated, not the government."
89,19,The way this works is that there are people that are unable to have a mask in their life and thus aren't ready to have a facial expression.
90,19,"I think it's funny that people think they can wear a mask and get a virus, but that I don't think they can do it because it doesn't work."
95,19,It’s a joke because I think it’s a joke because I don’t care how the government acts. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s only action. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s only action.

19,12,Vaccines are a joke if it's not just for people with HIV and they don't want to put people in one. That's what makes the joke funny if the joke is about vaccinations

76,19,"As a health care professional, I think it's funny and it's not a joke that's being made up."
83,19,The government has already passed laws that allow them to do so. The government is trying to make it harder for people to do their jobs and the government has a good incentive to do so. They are not allowed to do so for the government.
84,19,"Is there a reason that people wear masks? If so, it's not a joke, but a bit of a ripoff of the book."
86,19,There is no harm in making the AMA something they are trying to change. AMAs are to protect people from the spread of a virus.
89,19,"They don't seem to think they should put a mask on people when they get sick. That is, if a joke is not going to get you sick, the problem isn't with what is being said, it's with what is being said and not in the same way that jokes are being made."
90,19,I don't know. I'm going to assume that all these sexist jokes are so far from true but I wouldn't call them funny.
95,19,This is a joke because of this.

32,19,"As a doctor, I'm very impressed. I think the AMA is very accurate and you're really right. It's a funny joke, but the point is that it's a joke that's funny. That's the kind of joke that makes people think they are funny because they have a lot of shit and silly jokes. It's a joke about what they're trying to do, so I think it's a joke. The AMA is about how people think of themselves and their hivemind."
39,19,"A ripoff of a book that says people who vaccinate to prevent a pandemic need to get vaccinated because it is the purpose of a joke. The AMA is a joke and a joke about the government, because it is about preventing TB. There is not a joke, just a sarcastic joke about the government.

83,19,"I don't think they can legally require everyone to wear a mask in certain places. They are illegal in places. If they aren't mandated by the government, then no."
84,19,"It's all about a big, cliched joke. I just awoke from reading what a guy told me about the CDC's mask mandate."
86,19,I’m gonna go with a vaccinated mind 'but I don’t think it’s funny'.
89,19,"You were just making a joke. If it's a joke, it is a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
90,19,People who think a prank is a joke can only think it's funny when it's actually funny. They're joking about a joke that they think's not funny.
95,19,"As a lawyer, it's ridiculous to me that we get vaccinated only to prevent that disease and its spread - they're not talking about the actual treatment of HIV."
19,11,I think the entire point of an AMA is to keep people in a safe place and be in a safe environment. They are trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
19,12,"The movie is a joke, but it's about preventing the spread of AIDS."
19,14,A lot of people are not familiar with 'a lot of things' about the AMA. They're talking about a virus and not about it.
19,16,Is a joke supposed to be about a joke?
21,19,"> I think it's funny that you wear a mask while I'm in a pandemic a lot of the time, but I haven't actually had any symptoms with AIDS"
32,19,I don't understand why it's a joke at all.

52,19,"AMA? What? The guy isn't a doctor who is a doctor? The article is ""I don't think it's a joke,"" but I'm not sure what the point of the article is. It's a joke."
58,19,The AMA is based on a wiki article and is a joke.
61,19,I don't get why you think this is a joke. Vaccines are legal because they protect against all types of viruses. They are not able to prevent the spread of HIV. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
63,19,It's a joke and it's not about the CDC. It's about a prank that's supposed to be a joke. It's a joke because it's a prank. It's about the CDC's effort to stop the spread of the virus. It's about the CDC's effort to stop the spread of the virus.
66,19,It's a joke because the government has no legal obligation to protect people from disease.
68,19,AMA is what I call the AMA.
76,19,I can relate to that. A simple question about the CDC is the idea of a vaccine. It is for a serious problem and therefore is a joke that will be taken seriously. It is also a joke because people have to learn about it and learn from it. So it isn't that joke that has to be said. The reason that it isn't a joke is that it is a joke.
83,19,"You know what? The CDC is a government agency. They will send them to every nation that has an outbreak of HIV/AIDS. The government doesn't control everything, they have a duty to protect the country. They aren't the ones who have to keep their job, but there are a lot of people who aren't in the military."
84,19,"In other words, a lot of people are trying to get to the point of ""The government is a big force in making a joke."""
86,19,"So you want a new, better definition of the word?"
89,19,"No, that's not a joke. You said you're not a joke."
90,19,"Is it possible the CDC is trying to get more people to wear a mask? It seems like a great example of the type of joke that can work, but the thing that actually works is that they actually know what is actually going on and what is not."
95,19,"""We're trying to get rid of the idea of my husband stating that he would get vaccinated and I’m hoping he would be in the hospital."","
19,11,"In a sense, ""I don't know how to put on a mask, and I'm concerned that if I do get sick I'm going to get a TB shot, and that's the whole point of a AMA"". I don't know if that's a joke, but I can't help but think the AMA is a joke. A lot of people are not familiar with the movie, but I don't think it's a joke."
19,12,"It's not that you should wear a mask, it's that you should wear a mask."
19,14,"It is not a joke, it is a fact."
19,16,AMAs aren’t jokes. It’s about what people want to do and why they want to do it. It’s a joke because it’s about preventing the spread of a virus.
21,19,"AMA is basically about the government trying to convince people that people need the vaccine, that the drug is safe and that it is not illegal."
32,19,I can't think of any joke that would make me uncomfortable and the AMA would actually make me uncomfortable. It's not a joke because it's about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think of themselves and their hivemind. It's about how people think about the government.
39,19,AMA is a joke.
52,19,A lot of people are calling this a joke. There is not a whole lot of debate about it. It just sounds like a joke.
58,19,I'm pretty sure you're not going to be able to read the AMA. A lot of people don't understand the meaning of joke.
61,19,"You're probably just reading the same sentence multiple times, and then getting stuck in the same place as your friend."
63,19,"I don't want to be in a position to be a doctor if the movie is actually funny and the CDC isn't doing anything about it. I am a little dissatisfied that it's the same type of joke, as the AMA is a joke, but it's a joke because it's about how the CDC is trying to make people feel bad because it's a joke."
66,19,It's racist if I am not a doctor. They aren't getting a shot to prevent the spread of HIV.
68,19,"[Click here for the sub The most popular media. It’s pretty much just a way to spread information, make them interesting.’’ [[NAME]: ''We have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of a virus.""'' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad_Sam.jpg),"
76,19,"As a health care professional, I think it's funny and it's not a joke that's being made up. I think it's the right joke because it's a joke because the CDC has a legitimate obligation to prevent the spread of the virus."
83,19,"[The film is directed by Mark Rupert.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas/Vaxx-Habrg/), is a fictionalized documentary, and was made up by David Hicks and Steven Adler. The movie is also directed by Tom Hanks (whose voice is in the book)."
84,19,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
86,19,I like the title a lot but I can't think of a better example.
89,19,... I'd like to know that something I say I don't like to say
90,19,What's that? What's the best thing people can do? Wear a mask?
95,19,"""This is a joke because people don't care how the government acts. They just keep saying what they want."""
19,11,"It's very good. I don't like to talk about the movie, but I think it's a good joke because it's about the people who don't understand how people think about the government."
19,12,[Like [[NAME]: ''We have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of a virus.''
19,14,"AMA is basically about the government trying to convince people that people need a vaccine, that the drug is safe and that the government isn't illegal."
19,16,"It’s a joke because it’s a joke, and it’s just a joke about it."
21,19,The AMA is about the government trying to get people to wear a mask to help combat AIDS. It's actually a joke.
32,19,The best way to help prevent TB is to put the mask on to be a doctor for a week.
39,19,"They're promoting the AMA, I believe, and the AMA itself is based off of the book."
52,19,This is a funny question.
58,19,"I think the joke is being silly because it makes people think that AMAs aren't about government policies, and that the government isn't trying to stop it."
61,19,The joke was about the CDC preventing people from getting vaccinated. The joke was about the CDC preventing the spread of HIV and the CDC is trying to stop it.
63,19,"I was at the theater last week and was at one of these shows and the first line was ""This is a joke, but the AMA is overdue. The CDC isn't doing anything about it."" I don't think the AMA is a joke because it is about the CDC's effort to combat the spread of a virus."
66,19,Vaccines are for life. You are just not responsible for your own health.
68,19,"That joke was a joke. This was a joke. The AMA is an attempt to make people uncomfortable, because it prevents the spread of the virus."
76,19,I'm just trying to express a few more nuances to you.
83,19,"People have a right to want a doctor to see them, but no one can afford to know what a doctor's opinion is or how it's perceived to have a right to the government."
84,19,The fact that it is the perfect example of the ripoff is quite interesting.
86,19,"I'm a big fan of the AMAs, but I have never heard one called an AMA about the government being a joke, especially not in terms of how it was a joke."
89,19,"So... I'd say, ""We're supposed to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
