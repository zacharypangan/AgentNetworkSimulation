101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,13,"I'm from FL, you don't look very well and don't care."
29,13,We should have a mask.
37,13,i am still in the UK - there is only 1 person with a mask in my country - this man is just a fucking asshole
53,13,Vaccinations are a dangerous disease

14,13,As the guy on this sub says it is:
27,13,"It's a terrible thing to say. What makes you think you're a liberal? It's like that in the South, the only reason why you can't make a joke is because you're racist. And what makes you think you're crazy is that you don't like it when people have the right to do it."
29,13,I want to talk about my mother being vaccinated because she is very scared of getting a nasty virus. I want to have her go into a doctor and ask her if she is vaccinated? I want her to be on the phone with me when I go to the dentist.
37,13,"I don't see how you have an excuse for the lack of a'statewide mask mandate'. I just think that it's a bad idea for the government to force the federal government to change it. A person is not only dangerous to us, but also violent. That's a good way to look at it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
53,13,Vaccinations are a dangerous disease
54,13,I read that last paragraph because of what happened to my mom in FL.
61,13,i don't know about the scar but i wear a mask to protect other people i dont trust this vaccine
69,13,The CDC is using the info to stop the spread of the virus.
72,13,What a great day! It isn't about being a man in a pandemic. It is about not wanting to be a pandemic victim.
73,13,It's not as if he's trying to be a pedophile or a con artist or a pedophile. He's just trying to try and elicit someone who thinks he can do better than him.
84,13,"It seems that when you get a virus, you're going to get one of many things. The test is supposed to be a test of a 'dumb' viremia. So, in my state, you can get your shit done, but you must wear a mask at least once every day."
87,13,I don't understand why this is so common. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help.
98,13,"I'm the only person with a fat lip, so I don't know what you're talking about."
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,If you want to get away from this problem I recommend it - and not just because you are in FL - but because you're from the west coast and you're afraid of getting caught in a pandemic.
27,13,"It's not just the government that supports it, but the government itself."
29,13,id rather have her go to a doctor and ask her if she is vaccinated? I want her to be on the phone with me when i go to the dentist.
37,13,There aren't any actual measures that were drafted. Just the federal government.
53,13,The article says that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It seems the idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight.
54,13,"No, it's not the same as wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a mask. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination."
61,13,"""I love the idea that people who wear masks are really scared of the virus, and I think I'm going to go to work now because of the fucking new virus that hits our country."
69,13,So the point of the video is to make sure we have the right to go maskless in our office.
72,13,"""...because my friend has to get the mask because I can see him at the door with a face full of fear. This is what the people here are doing. Whenever I walk by my house or my home or whatever, there is a huge pile of dust everywhere, they look up at me."
73,13,"This is probably why it's so easy to say ""it doesn't matter what I do for the public health. I can do it for people in the world and I will not take anyone else in the world to do it."""
84,13,> I know that s a good idea to use the mask to avoid the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,13,Why would anyone want to go to a doctor when they can't get vaccinated?
98,13,Is a lip or a cheek not a sign of a disease? You can wear it with a nose or a cheek. It's a great way to tell if you're not a viral infection.

14,13,"'As the guy on this sub says it is:', ""If you want to get away from this problem I recommend it - and not just because you are in FL - but because you're from the west coast and you're afraid of getting caught in a pandemic. We need to be able to stop this virus from spreading."

37,13,"I do not follow the government's actions, but I just feel that a guy who isn't involved in the government's actions and isn't a major contributor to the overall health of the country should be more involved. I don't see the point here that anyone is getting a free pass for people who aren't aware of their own medical conditions, and isn't doing anything at all. It's not an unreasonable expectation that anyone who believes HIV/AIDS/syphilis/histamines/syphilis or other mental illness/sy"
53,13,I've had to wear a mask as part of my daily shave.
54,13,"I think your mom is a pedophile and isn't even sure if she is a pedophile, or if she's a pedophile. I'm pretty sure her mom is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her."
61,13,This is a good joke.
69,13,>(I am trying to make a joke... Why wouldn't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus? I think you can do it if you're a person.
72,13,i just want to thank you for having an upvote
73,13,"In California, the government is responsible for the spread of HIV. He had a statewide mask mandate. The state is bringing a new policy. It's a really stupid issue."
84,13,"You have your right to say that the government isn't going to do anything about HIV....and the government is being oblivious to a fact. I know what the government thinks about the virus, but you have to give the doctor that kind of impression. The test results are a pretty positive sign. I know that it's a good idea to use the shield to avoid the spread of a virus. However, in most places there are a variety of vaccines, the mask mandate isn't an ideal way to disinfect hands after you leave work, so"
87,13,It seems to me that if you can get the vaccine before you get the symptoms you are gonna get a reaction that is very different from what you are getting with the vaccine.
98,13,"It’s funny, but really doesn’t make sense."
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,"AIDS is a scary disease, and it's not a joke. You don't have to have a mask or have it on. There's no real way to stop it, and if you don't want to get it you can't, which is why you can't. The idea is to scar people and make them feel better, but that doesn't mean you can't make them feel better."
27,13,"I think a lot of people don't wear a mask, but the government has the right to do what it wants, and they don't have the right to do it."
29,13,I know there's a lot of people that think it's a joke.
37,13,"I don't know, this is really the most accurate quote I've ever heard."
53,13,"I'm not a liberal, but if I were in the US, I would think it was a joke."
54,13,It isn't an appropriate use of the word as a joke. It's a way of saying something that's actually an important point of opinion.
61,13,... This is a good joke.
69,13,"This is what I read when I first read about the CDC, so I guess it's a good idea to read the ""why don't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus?"""
72,13,"I've had a couple cases, but they don't seem to be affecting anyone. Especially not people."
73,13,There's a lot going on.
84,13,"I don't know if the person - a professional or not - is really a good person to be talking to, because I've heard from many different experts and it's not about the mask mandate."
87,13,I'm a physician and I have never seen a reaction on a vaccinated person. It's like someone talking about a complication because their blood sugar is too high to be able to regulate properly.
98,13,"What is a fat lip, or something that doesn't belong in the human body?"
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,It's not a joke. The article was meant as a joke but not to deflect an actual message. It's a joke. It is a joke. I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
27,13,"I don't think the government is saying anything about the situation, but there is a point in their post stating that they are preventing the spread of viruses by the government."
29,13,[His story isn't a joke. It's a premise and a point. I don't think you're a joke. I'm saying that you're just not on the right side of the line.

54,13,"Vaccination is an important part of the vaccination program that is being implemented in the US. It is not an appropriate use of the word as a joke. It is a joke, that's just what the government is doing."
61,13,I think it's time to start asking more people to understand the vaccine debate.
69,13,"The post is also just a joke, like the CDC ''I can't see you in the CDC,'' or the CDC's 'My Family'' in here."
72,13,Is it a joke that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal?
73,13,It doesn't seem like he's trying to go through this to get his slap on the wrist. He's trying to get a federal mask that's not going to do much.
84,13,"I've been going to a doctor for a long time, and I think my doctor is a pretty good person. The best thing I can do now is get a doctor who knows how to make sure I don't get a sick day and I can't go back to work without a mask on. It's pretty sad though, to see."
87,13,">A...because the vaccine is on the people who have it. I'm not a doctor, and I know people who haven't had the experience of getting vaccinated and still think they have a problem with that."

27,13,"I'm sorry to hear that, but this makes me sick to my stomach."
29,13,"It's the perfect solution. If you know what you're doing, it can actually change the nature of your experience."
37,13,"Honestly I'd be VERY surprised if this article were true, and that's a fairly small sample size. Those are not the type of cases where you're going to get a warning."
53,13,"I am so sorry this has happened to you. I have no idea what you mean by ""fake"" as in ""skinny jokes"" in other posts."
54,13,">Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what you mean."

72,13,You fucking fool.

37,13,"The CDC is putting too much emphasis on preventing infections, and the anti-viral groups are putting too much emphasis on preventing them. So, what's the problem? They don't care if people in hospitals are infected. They're just saying that they can do better, and that people aren't actually being infected."
53,13,"As far as I know, there is no reason for the NSA to make fun of the jokes that are made. I would like to point out that the jokes I made are the ones that were used because there are so many different people who will be able to keep themselves vaccinated, as long as they get vaccinated properly. It’s a pretty good one."
54,13,"I'd say this isn't as bad as it sounds, but if it's just me and my friend going to the same place I know, there's a difference between the two. If we're going to go all out to eat and watch a movie together we will be more likely to meet someone from a different place and share a meal together."
61,13,"As someone who doesn't even know anything about politics, he would not be in the audience if this was the case."

72,13,You are overreacting. This is not a joke.
73,13,This is one of the only ad where the government is a problem with this and not the government incompetent.
84,13,It's a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What the Obama administration thinks of this?
87,13,It is only the first part that has really come up in the article. I read the title but I thought it was just a joke.
98,13,I thought it was funny but he kept it secret when I made fun of it. It makes it seem like the other people thought it was a joke. I did the same thing with my ex boyfriend's husband. I thought it was funny but I didn't like it because he used it as a joke.
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,What's funny is the AMA was intended as a joke to help us deal with the issue but not to deflect a real message. A joke is a joke. It doesn't make sense to say it's a joke. It is a joke.

72,13,"He said that, for the first time, ""the government can't stop it by making fun of it, and therefore doesn't want to do it""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccines). So, he wasn't even trying to make fun of it, he just wanted to make fun of it."
73,13,"I am a huge anti-virus fan in the US and it is absolutely a nightmare to deal with.

87,13,I just read the title. It's more about why people are so concerned about this.
98,13,A mask is a form of self-protection for the body. The body acts as a shield against the infection.
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,OP  He did not have a mask and no vaccination. He's talking about the government and not his own. The government has failed to respond. The AMA was a joke and the comments I'm seeing came from people that disagree with him.

29,13,"If you want to talk about your mother being vaccinated, that's good enough."

73,13,"I live in New York City, so I can't tell you for sure how bad it is because they are bringing out a mask in the states. It is pretty obvious that they've got a mask policy.

84,13,"I want you to know what the government believes. You have a right to tell me that the mask mandate is bad, but the government is trying to make it illegal. The whole concept of the mandate is a joke."

Generally speaking it's not illegal to wear a mask to stop a disease in the US, unless you have medical insurance that covers them. The federal government is not allowed to make it illegal to wear a mask, which would be inappropriate."
84,13,"It seems like the mask mandate is a joke. It's a joke. I'm a guy in my mask. But I’m not going to let my bf tell me that it’s illegal because I don’t want to say something. I just want to make sure my bf doesn’t get shit. Considering the number of people who get sick with HIV/AIDS/middle-eighth time that has passed, i’m not sure how much of a joke this is."

98,13,The people who like a mask can be friends with anyone. Its like saying the people who like a person's face can't speak a language without having a face. And this guy wants to get the public's support. The guy is trying to make the point that I'm a bit of a dick for not fucking a guy who wears a mask.
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,This would be like saying I'd be a huge pedophile and I'd do the same.
27,13,"Vaccines are used to prevent infections from spreading, and therefore have a lower chance of transmission than someone else who doesn't."

27,13,The fact that the government and its partners cannot prevent the spread of a disease is something that will cause the CDC to rip off a book about vaccines versus the CDC's.

14,13,They're not kidding. You can't win a race and win a t shirt while you're there. This is a joke.
27,13,It's been a long time. I feel like the whole joke in the AMA is about how the CDC has an opinion on. It's a huge amount of naivete that a bunch of people with dandruff don't wear a mask and think that they'll have more fun if they don't wear a mask.
29,13,"The government has a legal obligation to make you look sick, but not the problem. Besides, it will not solve your medical problems."
37,13,There is a problem here. A man who wears a mask is a doctor who is going to eat shit because he has HIV and isn't even sure he can wear a mask.
53,13,"I'm very surprised that people in your section would be uncomfortable wearing a mask, because they're not in the medical field. I can only imagine that a mask makes me uncomfortable and uncomfortable, but it does help with the issue of infection, not the symptoms of HIV."
54,13,It's one of those things that makes you feel like the person who makes it is doing the right thing. Putting a mask on a man or woman without knowing how to wear it is an inappropriate way to start a conversation and not even be able to get a public eye and it sounds like a joke and it sounds like it's being racist.
61,13,So I've had this question for months. I've been a little indifferent to the joke but I like to think I'm a little embarrassed that you're going to get sick without wearing a mask.
69,13,Is this an outright ripoff of the book?
72,13,"Vaccines aren't illegal, and that's why they are being used to stop it."
73,13,"Yes, it is an anti-fiscal war. They're not trying to get money from the government. They're promoting a disease they're not comfortable with, and it's a huge problem, which isn't an issue in any way."
84,13,That's pretty much the name of the book. The guy who said it was like the 'Mask Me Anything' kind of joke?
87,13,"You can get vaccinated, but only for a short amount of time. If the vaccine doesn't work, it doesn't work because the AMA doesn't help in that regard. It's not the AMA's job to stop the spread of a virus. It's the AMA's job to prevent the spread of a virus."
98,13,"The truth is that it is a joke, but it is a joke based on the fact that you are a huge fan of people wearing masks because it's funny but doesn't make any sense in today's society."
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,"CANNOTANSWER - People who do not understand the concept of a ""job"" are blaming their own health care and health system, while avoiding the dangers of wearing a mask."
27,13,I feel like this joke is funny because of the government being against it.
29,13,"I don't know. It's not a joke, or even a joke. But it would be good enough. It's a very nice and non-sensical way to do the same thing."
37,13,The question is why was he allowed to wear a mask?
53,13,I don't know about the world but I'd think I know better now.
54,13,What's funny is when the people who made it are trying to justify what they're doing. This is what I'm talking about. I don't even want to tell anyone I do this.
61,13,Vaccines are not legal or fair. There are many more jokes about how people want to spread HIV.
69,13,"CDC ripoff: I’m a bit over the head. I don’t know what you are talking about, but there’s a whole bunch of references to other CDC movie shit that don’t make much sense besides a joke"
72,13,"Vaccines are not a joke. They are not a joke. The CDC has made a huge mistake by allowing them to be sold as an alternative to their AIDS vaccines, and thus preventing their people from getting the vaccines in the first place. This is a joke, a joke, and no joke. It doesn't change the fact that people are ignoring it and trying to make people laugh at it, and in so doing it will get you sick and you have to go see a doctor."
73,13,"As I have said before a good deal of government policies and programs exist, I'd like to suggest that you read this as ""the issue with the government in the US""."
84,13,What the fuck are you reading? The guy who says this is a joke. 
87,13,"In the UK, vaccines are a voluntary process that prevents people from inhaling and transmitting a virus. Generally, a vaccine is not needed."
98,13,"Well, there are lots of things that make the world a better place."
101,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,13,Why is it that they're not going to have a doctor that identifies as a joke in a movie?
27,13,"That's why the government is trying to take care of the HIV epidemic, not a good idea."
29,13,Vaccines are not legal unless you have a CDC medical card or a prescription medication. They are not legal unless you have a prescription medication. Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
