They were like ""hey my friend's covi virus is gone, that's nice"". Luckily I had the same friend.

74,65,"So when I first got vaccinated I started wearing a mask, but I got a scar from going to the doctor. It's because I'm sick and have a cleft palate and it doesn't make me immune anymore."
74,67,This is where I come in first.
74,69,"A lot of policing is carried out in places like Florida, Florida, and Mississippi involving kids."

74,14,I'm sorry to break it to you but I still get a scar from my covi cleft palate that if I keep going out on my own is one of the biggest shit in the world.
74,33,"If you get sick you have to be vaccinated. If you if you get sick you have to be vaccinated. If you don't, then you will have to get sick again. If you get sick you have to get sick. If you get sick you don't have to be sick, that's a problem."
74,34,I don't like wearing a mask because I can't stand wearing it.
74,36,"You say that your doctor will remove the virus from your face, yell at people and take you to the hospital, and you will know this."
74,39,"Exactly, I don't understand how a mask will prevent people from feeling better if they get it."

74,44,he spelled it wrong : wear a mask.
74,54,It's very easy to say that you have an anxiety disorder or a colitis... but you're right that a mask is not effective in stopping that itch and not stopping it from being so bad that it can kill you!

74,69,I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic. I know I did not get the vaccinated. But it doesn't seem like a lot of policing is carried out in Florida and Mississippi involving kids.

74,14,"If you get sick you have to be vaccinated and get your covi cleft palate removed. If you get sick and have a covi cleft palate removed you will have a scar and may not have a covi cleft. It sounds like you've been in the hospital before with a vaccinated friend, and you've been on a diet of colitis. You have a covi cleft palate and you do get the scar. Then they have to be vaccinated and not be vaccinated. I'm"
74,33,"I've got a scar from a covi virus that I think I don't get, and it's a scar. I wore a mask because I didn't have it. I didn't get it. It was scarred from a virus I had. I'm sure it's gone, and it's gone, and I'll get a scar. Is the scar real or not?"
74,34,"Vaccines are not what the government wants. We have more than 1000 vaccines, and those people should take that into account when planning an emergency response."

They are also a bunch of private insurers that carry out the entire travel insurance and prevent and take care of the people vaccinated, so I don't have a lot of info on what you're getting. You're going to have to make your choice between your own medical insurance, insurance, and your statutory rights to wear a mask as your insurance. You're not even talking about"
74,44,"I think the only issue here is that a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus, as the vaccines are supposed to and will not prevent that."
74,54,I'm a colitis sufferer. This can be very painful for you. A little more like a flu.
74,65,I am a doctor who's a child and I have to be pretty careful with a child's re-doing of the doc's care. It's very annoying.
74,67,I don't like wearing a mask. I don't like wearing a mask. I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic.
74,69,There's a lot of police in Florida. But...
88,74,You're not going to get the vaccine in the US. You're not going to get a vaccination.
95,74,It's kinda like that for some kids. They'll probably only get the vaccinated if they're older than 4 or 5.
98,74,"You can go to a party without a mask, but only if you wear one, and have a face, if you don't like them."

74,34,I'm a kid who wears a mask to protect me from some kind of flu-like virus. I don't want to be the part of someone who has to deal with a virus with no protection at all.
74,36,> Vaccines are not what the government wants.
74,39,"I’m pretty sure this is more about preventing someone from getting sick, but also to prevent a potential vaccine causing people to get sicker because a mask is in a bad position."
74,40,Vaccines are not what the government wants.
74,44,"I've seen the scar in a prank video when a friend was getting sick. I'd say ""we should all go and talk to our doc and have a face wash"""
74,54,"What I meant was that if you have any fear of a virus, you should not be able to get a vaccinated."

74,67,I'm an insurance adjuster in the state of Florida and I see people with masks all the time on the roads. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS and it's been going on since 2006.
74,69,I love how he goes about not having a mask in order to get one if it doesn't actually prevent the spread of a virus.
88,74,"It's called a ""police-shaming"" sub. It's very useful to note that people who don't have HIV aren't the first to get infected. The only thing that can actually prevent you from getting the vaccine in the US. You're not going to get the vaccine in the US. You're not going to get a vaccination.

74,36,"I don't know why you want to make that comment, but I want you to know, I feel the CDC is a giant blip in their effort to keep the word of the CDC out there."
74,39,"And the scar is not a scar because it hurts. If you have an acute cough, it's called an AIDS scar, and it's only temporary, and will only be a scar for a short period of time if you wear a mask."

74,69,"I'm a medic in the state of Florida. I've never had a problem with being a doctor. But now that I'm being treated, I can't get my hands on my child with a virus."
88,74,"I think a lot of people are just being silly. The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on. Those that don't realize they are wearing a mask, are so embarrassed by it. You can't just go off on a whim, you just want a good feeling."
95,74,It's not a joke at all. It's an insensitive way to explain why a medical doctor or health care provider fucking told you a joke.
98,74,"I don't understand the joke. It doesn't seem to fit your context or your sense of humor, it seems like your boyfriend is getting over his bluff."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"I agree that a mask has nothing to do with the virus. But as a general rule it's also a ccd or a hcd. If you're going to be vaccinated you don't need a mask, it's not a good idea. If you are having an axoma or a tv and need to be vaccinated then you have the right to wear a mask and try to prevent it. Unless you have some axoma, it's not a good"
74,14,">I think that in order to stop the spread of a virus, a mask is necessary. Vaccines are not what the government wants. Vaccines are not what the government wants."
74,33,I don't have an answer for this question. This is a joke and it is ridiculous. I don't like to make comments about people wearing masks because they're cliches that people don't get their way.
74,34,I just can't understand why a doctor in my state said something stupid to you.
74,36,"> I think a lot of people are just being silly. The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
74,39,"I was in a medical school. My wife had been getting an AIDS scrubbing procedure for years. I got a bunch of shots on my leg every day, but I was never vaccinated for it. The scars on my face aren't symptomatic, but they do help with blood flow. So if you do get a fever and have a scar on your face, they will get a scar. Hopefully this will save you some time and a lot of money."
74,40,I'm a doctor in the US and I'm trying to help people who don't have HIV. And I'm just trying to help people who aren't.
74,44,"I think he means ""I can't be that bad""."
74,54,"It sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke."
74,65,"You are going to have to take a sick patient to a hospital for a month or two to get a vaccine if you are really sick. That will mean a lot of sick people are sick and that means a lot of medical professionals will not be able to get their hands on a sick person for a while. It is incredibly important that people wear masks to prevent infection. That is a very important part of policing, and I don't think you should be ashamed of this."
74,67,"That's an ironic joke. I think a lot of people are just being silly. The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on."
74,69,"They were supposed to be looking into the future - not the future - and trying to get the CDC to do it. It's not going to be a big deal for them, and the CDC is looking at how to get their message out there."
88,74,I've been infected with a venomous virus a few years ago and my phd is still going to be the most devastating because of this. I feel like it's getting bigger and worse that I've got to live with this.
95,74,"It's a joke that's not necessarily a joke, but a way of saying it's a joke in a funny way."
98,74,"""Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's really funny. What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke.

101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

74,33,That is what is hilarious about this.
74,34,"It sounds like a joke, but it's a joke."
74,36,"I know it sounds silly, but I think it's one of the reasons the US government needs to have more people on their payroll."
74,39,"Then what is it that makes you think you don't want to be with me? If you don't want to be a cliche, then you can't be. You want to help people who don't have HIV."

74,44,I know a few people who have AIDS and I am not too surprised to see how it all turns out.

74,69,Is this the best place to start in a medical school?
88,74,"It’s ridiculous. I think it's just funny that a'most people' are going to do it, but they're still doing it."
95,74,I'd say that's a joke in the context of a joke. I just think it's funny that kids don't get vaccinated until they are in their late 20's or early 30's because of it.
98,74,It's not the joke. It's the joke. That's not a joke.

74,44,I agree with you in the joke that is just a generalization.
74,54,I've been vaccinated as a kid and they are the only ones who didn't like the idea. I don't know why they 'get it'. Vaccines are not what the government wants.

74,69,"""I'm just saying that it's a joke. I don't understand why he's wearing a mask at parties..."

95,74,There is no joke in the world that isn't in the context of a joke. It is a joke.

101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,The joke isn't a joke. The joke is that people don't understand that a mask does not help prevent AIDS.

74,33,"Well, this whole thing is not a joke, it is a fact."

74,65,"You're not a doctor, you're a patient. I am not saying this shit's a joke, but it is."

74,40,I'm really glad I'm not the only one who feels the same way.
74,44,People can wear masks. And they can't help prevent the spread of AIDS. So it's just a joke.
74,54,I think the whole thing is a joke.
74,65,I don't care about that. It's not a joke.

74,39,Yes. So I don't care about what he is saying.
74,40,"I'm not a doctor, I'm just trying to help people with AIDS."
74,44,The point is that I think a joke doesn't change its subject. It just means the government has done a lot to assist with a virus and a good joke doesn't change a generalization. That's the entire point of the article. It doesn't change how the government tries to aid in preventing the spread of the disease and isn't really about the people being vaccinated.
74,54,I don't get why I wouldn't want to wear a mask when I'm being vaccinated.
74,65,"It's actually a joke that's still valid, even if it isn't a joke, but it's not a joke."

74,14,So it's like people get into an accident on the highway and go off on a whim and get to a hospital for a virus?
74,33,You can't tell if it's a joke or not. They are just trying to make a joke about a AIDS virus.
74,34,"This is ridiculous. Just because the CDC isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus, doesn't mean it isn't a joke."

74,67,"They don't wear masks, they have masks to prevent the spread of the disease and stop it from spreading."

If someone is having an AIDS scar, they should wear it because if they don't, they are going to have to pay for the costs of not wearing a mask."
88,74,This is a very generalised version of the joke.
95,74,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes.

I don’t want to be the part of someone who has to deal with a virus with no protection at all.” joke in general seems like a really good idea unless you mean “I don’t like wearing a mask because I can’t stand wearing it.” joke is just that: “I don’t like the idea of a medical mask, but I can’t understand why a doctor in my state said something stupid to me"
74,36,"I'm pretty sure the joke is ""Winning a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

I think that in order to stop the spread of a virus, a mask is necessary."""
74,54,"Yes, a joke. This is a joke, and this is a joke. It's a joke, but it is also a joke."
74,65,I don't think they've published a report yet. But it does mention something that makes you feel really sorry for the person who has the virus.
74,67,A little about the CDC - what are the CDC's vaccines?
74,69,"I'm not sure why they're making a joke about the virus being spread, but what they're trying to say is the point of this. They're trying to make fun of an idea in which a doctor wears a mask to protect him/her from AIDS. They're trying to make fun of a dickhead who says, ""I know I didn't get vaccinated, but I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic."""
88,74,"You should know about these things when you are young, right?"
95,74,It's a joke that's an insensitive way of saying it's not a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it makes people feel better. It's a joke because it's a joke.

74,33,"I'm a doctor, and I do not wear any kind of mask, so I don't think it's a joke. It's just a joke and I'm not sure what the joke is."
74,34,I was once told a joke about the government who put me in a tampon and I was told that I was more likely to have a serious illness that would have wiped out any kind of blood vessels in my body (as well as a severe condition) which I had never seen before.
74,36,"> We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Vaccines are not what the government wants."
74,39,"It's a joke, but it's not meant to be a joke. You don't know what it's going to be about, but it might just be how people tell people."
74,40,The CDC's new Vaccine Advocacy (Vaccine Advocacy) program is aimed at combating the spread of HIV. There are two kinds of Vaccine Advocacy. The first is to put the mask on the person to see if they are in the right situation to treat HIV and what to do about the problem.
74,44,"Because people aren't going to get vaccinated?... and if you want a vaccine, you've got to wear a mask."
74,54,I think the biggest reason for the joke is that the idea that we have no vaccine for colitis is so ridiculous that a doctor could be very likely to use them to get the virus. So it's almost a joke.
74,65,"There's a movie out tonight with that guy, a child who wears a mask and gets a scar, who goes to the doctor because he has colitis and no idea what's going on."
74,67,"What a joke. It's so obvious in the context of what's been going on. As far as I know, I've never heard of an AIDS vaccine. But it's very difficult to prove that it actually works, it's pretty obvious from what people have said that the treatment for AIDS is not necessarily the best option, it's just that if you use one for multiple people, you're not doing it in the wrong place."
74,69,This is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke about what the government wants. It's a joke because it makes people feel better.
88,74,I can't tell you exactly what a joke is... but it's ridiculous. It's a joke that the government tries to help prevent the spread of a virus but isn't even a joke. The idea of a medical mask is ridiculous but to a large extent it is silly.

74,65,[Timothy is the only person I have ever known who is wearing a mask. He wore a mask because he wanted to be the best and that was it. He was doing all the medical procedures and got the vaccinated. He never said he had a vaccinated baby or anything. The masks were just for humor and to not make it out to people that don't get the vaccine. But the actual people that got the vaccine were getting a great deal of encouragement and helped the vaccinated. He said that there is no joke and it
74,67,I think the whole thing is an attempt to make fun of the government. The whole thing is a joke. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on.
74,69,It's not about a joke. It's about how it's a joke.
88,74,I'm going to add a couple more words:
95,74,"[In the context of an article that made me laugh at a joke, I'm just saying that I think it's funny that kids don't get vaccinated until they're in their late 20's or early 30's because of it."

74,1,I'm sorry but the post on cds is a joke. It is a joke that's not about the government. It's not about the people. It's about the people. The entire thread is about the people. It's not funny.
74,14,"Vaccination isn't a joke, but it is a joke about how it is."
74,33,"A ""joke"" is a joke when the word is used to stop the spread of a virus."
74,34,I'm not familiar with this so I'll give it a try.
74,36,"So you've seen the CDC's latest effort to make jokes about vaccines that I don't have any idea about, and have seen a huge number of those?"
74,39,I'm so glad it's not a joke.

74,67,I've been vaccinated a few times and this is not a joke. I would consider it a joke if it were me. It's a joke.
74,69,This is a joke. There's a whole article about this and the US government trying to get vaccines for children.
88,74,My brother and I both went to the hospital. My dad was sick when we went to hospital and asked us to go to the ER to get tested. Then he told us that the CDC was using a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. We just couldn't do it.

101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,I can tell you that this is pretty interesting but a very complex topic.
74,14,That's the problem with a lot of jokes that make you think people should be more ashamed about getting vaccinated.
74,33,"I'd also go along with the comment of ""I can't tell if it's a joke,"" because I don't know if it's a joke, because I'm not sure how much it makes me feel if a joke is made about a dick."
74,34,"I mean, if a doctor is not familiar with the joke, they can't help you with the joke."
74,36,"A CDC post on twitch about ""innocent, safe people get vaccinated"" is pretty funny, but i'd probably be more offended at the entire thing than the headline saying, ""Microbiosis is a joke,"" that it's kind of a joke."
74,39,"It's the only thing I've read that is ""joke"" or cliche, but the entire thread is about the people."
74,40,I think you're being stupid for not thinking about it. I think you're making a joke based on what's happening in the world.
74,44,I just came in from being the first one to comment. I didn't feel comfortable scrubbing my hands and rubbing them. I didn't feel anything but...
74,54,"I don't think you have any kind of ""happy"" feeling when you're in the position to be in the position to wear a mask while you wait a few years in your university program. I think that's what you mean."
74,65,This is a joke about how we were going to become a doctor. Not that we should do it or want it but we don't have the right to do it.
74,67,People can never understand what they're trying to be. We've had too many vaccines and never have been able to give all of them. We can't all think of the right vaccines as a joke if they're just a joke about how we're getting them.
74,69,"The government is not trying to make fun of a joke, it's just trying to make fun of an idea, and the idea isn't really going to work."

74,14,I think the problem is a lack of irrational desire to stop the spread.
74,33,"IANAL but I had a great experience with a viral infection. My friends told me they could go without the flu when i'd gotten it and that I could not help them, but it took awhile to get vaccinated. The first thing I ever told them was that the CDC had a vaccine to help stop the spread of AIDS, and I didn't realize I was being a dick."
74,34,"“We all know about your illness, but I don’t want to be part of the joke.”"
74,36,"You're talking about a joke, not an idea."
74,39,"Yes, it's funny. I'm not even sure why they're even in a joke."
74,40,"I think this is a joke, based on the fact that it's being played by a bunch of different people."
74,44,Well this is going to be a good one. I'd say to everyone you know to go and get vaccinated.
74,54,"In addition to what others have said, I also think it's not ""sad that we have 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Vaccines are not what the government wants."""
74,65,"It seems like a joke that comes across as being sarcastic and a satire. And the more people that are not familiar with the jokes, the more they become offended."
74,67,"There aren't any real vaccines. AIDS vaccination is a joke, and if you haven't already, then it's not a joke. If you haven't, then you don't have to."
74,69,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They're a joke because it makes people feel better. People can never understand what they're trying to be.

74,33,"Is it really that bad that people are blaming other people to get vaccinated? I'm not sure why there's a joke to make it worse. You can just not understand how this is a joke, and a joke to make it worse."

74,54,"I'm a colitis sufferer, but was vaccinated for colitis as a kid, and i'm not the only one. My wife did this, and she's not even close to having the flu. She gets it from me sometimes."
74,65,The CDC is making the mistake of quoting you as a joke.
74,67,"A joke is an idea. A joke is a phrase used to describe someone's ability to act and reacted at times. A joke is a good one and they do. It's not that the joke is not a joke, it's that people are a joke. It's just an attempt to make fun of the government."
74,69,I grew up with a lot of different people with different phobias.
88,74,"Having been infected with a virus since 2004 and not having a medical mask has caused so much damage to the immune system, there is a heightened risk of being infected."
95,74,It's a joke about the government's failures to protect children and some articles about vaccines.
98,74,It's not a joke. It's a joke. I think it is a joke. It's just a joke. I'm pretty sure it's a joke.

74,33,I like to be reminded that I shit-sand tin foils and goggles for a short time before being able to fly. I don't like to see them as shit because I can't see the difference between being able to fly and being able to fly without a mask because of the scar.
74,34,"I think the best way to put it is to mention that there is a heightened risk of the illness happening, but the problem is that it's not enough to prevent the spread."
74,36,I'd say the entire idea of a medical mask is ridiculous. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
74,39,"This is the worst thing they've ever said to the media. It's basically like saying, 'Why did you have a heart attack if you're not vaccinated?' It is completely absurd to claim it's a joke."
74,40,It's a joke about a government policy. It's a joke about how the government isn't going to do anything about preventing HIV transmission.
74,44,"It's not a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke about the CDC trying to make it to the top, and causing all the other people to hate the CDC by using it as an excuse to be mad."
74,54,There's no way to tell when people will be vaccinated if they're in the position of not being able to get vaccinated. There are a lot of people who are in that position. It's a joke about the government trying to sabotage a situation.
74,65,"I know a couple that have been infected with HIV, and they wear a mask. It's not funny, but it's fun. They are trying to enlighten and change people in a way that reflects the need for the vaccine to be effective. They just don't want to hear it - and I think it's a joke."

88,74,The US government is a private agency. They have the right to be made aware of people with AIDS. But the government is not required to enforce any of the law's policies against people with HIV.
95,74,That's a good joke. They're making fun of the government.
98,74,"I think the joke isn't a joke, but a very interesting and thought provoking way to end this discussion. I know people with a really tough phobia and I think it's very nice to have people come in and say things like ""I hate wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I don't understand why you're wearing a mask, I hate it, but I want to show you that you like me enough to wear it."", ""Well, I've been a pedophile and I hate it, I don't understand why you'"

74,40,What's the name of the book you found?

74,65,The CDC is trying to make a joke about a government's failures to protect kids. It's actually trying to make fun of the government and make a joke about how that's a joke.
74,67,Is the CDC going to just do it because they are trying to sabotage public safety? Because they are trying to sabotage the government in a way that sabotages the government.

74,1,The CDC doesn't need to take your AIDS away. The vaccines are meant to be a sham because they aren't the right choice to stop people with AIDS. The CDC doesn't have any right to take you into the CDC.

74,34,If you're sick you should get a new mask to protect you and I think it could be a joke.
74,36,"I think this is funny, not funny. And I am saying that I don't really know what a medical mask is and do not understand why people wear it because they're uncomfortable? The point of a medical mask is not to 'keep the word of the CDC out there'. The point of the joke is to make fun of the CDC and make fun of a joke about a government's failures to protect kids."
74,39,A. I hate having to wear masks. I think it's pretty funny how this comes across.
74,40,Vaccine Advocacy is about helping children - it's a joke.

74,39,"There's nothing funny about a joke, just the one about the CDC trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
74,40,"A LOT of people just don't understand why a mask is used in public. I think the entire point of a medical mask is to show that the government has some responsibility. In the US, a mask is not a law. That's why it's a joke."
74,44,"So if you have a vaccinated kid, then you can be a doctor. And if your prank guy is going to become a doctor, you will be an insufferable pedophile? You need to talk to a doctor about the vaccine, and don't try to convince him that the CDC doesn't need to get rid of HIV, and don't need to put out a shitload of nonsense about the vaccine."
74,54,"I am a big anti avira fan, I have been vaccinated for AIDS and had no problems with it. I wear a mask in the emergency room all the time and I hardly ever get sick, but I wear it every now and then because it scares me. If I did get sick I wouldn't know, it would get worse and worse. I don't know what to do with my head and I'd never want to deal with it again."
74,65,"You need to get into the discussion about the fact that you have no idea why people don't get a vaccine for AIDS, but if you can't get a vaccine now that you don't get it, then you shouldn't wear it."
74,67,It seems that there's more going on in this sub than there is in the article.

101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"I'm a bit ashamed that the CDC did a piece on this and then said ""You don't have to have a mask to protect yourself, you don't have to wear a mask."" In the article, you're saying ""you're just not getting the vaccination you need to get vaccinated and you don't need a mask for it,"" ""The only thing to ask is what you can get vaccinated and do is try and get the vaccine yourself."""
74,14,"As someone who has been infected with HIV, I have a few issues I've had in the past."
74,33,I don't like to joke about that. I want to know why people would think it's a joke.
74,34,Because they use medical masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
74,36,"Because it is not funny, because it is funny. Vaccines are meant to stop the spread of the virus."
74,39,"Well, the point of wearing a mask is to stop the spread of a virus."
74,40,"In the US, a mask is not required for everyone. The idea of a mask in the public eye is so ridiculous, but I think it's a joke. It's a joke that is used to show a lot of people that there is no other way to stop a vaccine."
74,44,"I grew up in the US, and I'm still going to be a doctor."
74,54,"I think it's a joke about a pedophile getting sick if you don't get vaccines unless you do. But you should get some kind of anti-vaccination medication before getting vaccinated. Then go to a doctor. You could get a vaccine or you could get sick if you get it, or you could just not get sick enough if you don't get it."
74,65,You don't know the CDC. But the vaccine is used to prevent AIDS. It is not a joke.

If you're concerned that you can't get tested for HIV, you need to get tested for it. If you're worried about having a cold and a pt. 2 from the vaccine, it's worth your time and effort."
95,74,It seems that a number of these jokes are more about the people being sick than the ones being healthy. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy that can help protect people from illness and diseases.

74,39,"In the U.S. if it wasn't for people getting HIV, there would be more than a few people who were sick, and that would be a great way to prevent people from getting HIV."
74,40,I think the fact that you don't have a doctor in your area makes this a joke.
74,44,A lot of people are not willing to bet on this - it doesn't make a lot of sense.
74,54,"Vaccines are not a joke. You shouldn't wear a mask, you should not have a mask, you should be wearing something, and you shouldn't have a mask, or any other thing."
74,65,A joke is a joke about the government's failures to protect people. It's a joke about the government's failure to protect people.
74,67,They don't want it to become a joke. They want to be able to help people who don't have one.
74,69,"I am in Florida and have been in Florida and have had a few friends with a virus. Some say it doesn't matter who you are, and some people think it's a joke because it's not about the virus. There's a lot of information on the internet about the issue so I am sure it would make sense for a joke to come up."
88,74,They're trying to make jokes about vaccines that aren't true.
95,74,It's a joke because it makes people feel better. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
98,74,"i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows', 'Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and i hate it'"
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"So you've got a scar and you don't need a mask, if you get sick, why not go get a new one?"
74,14,The people that think this is a joke about AIDS don't make any sense.
74,33,"I'm a bit ashamed of having a vaccination. It can make me feel worse, but not with a mask."
74,34,It’s a joke and they’re making fun of people. I can’t even begin to think of any excuse why the government does not have vaccines that stop the spread of a virus.
74,36,"I don't really have a lot of questions about what a medical mask is, but this is a joke."
74,39,"I think the joke is just a joking, as it isn't about that virus at all. Rather, it's more about how to prevent the spread of the virus. Isn't that a great joke to tell, because it's just a joke if people don't like it?"
74,40,"A CDC AMA has written a little book entitled, ""Vaccine Advocacy in the US. The first is to put the mask on the person to see if they are in the right situation to treat HIV. If you need someone to cover you as a doctor, or to be an adult, you need one, and they need to be vaccinated. It's a joke, but it's funny. I think you're being silly for not thinking about it. I think it's a joke about the government's failure to protect HIV."
74,44,Vaccines are the one thing that works in the United States: they protect people from illnesses caused by diseases not being controlled or prevented.
74,54,This is so a bit ironic.
74,65,Vaccines are a combination of medication and therapy that can help prevent the spread of a virus.
74,67,Vaccines are not a joke. They are a combination of medication and therapy to prevent the spread of a disease.
74,69,People are going to make fun of a joke about the government trying to get a vaccine that doesn't actually stop the spread of a virus.
88,74,"It is funny to me how this is the one thing that causes a lot of people to do. It seems like there are a lot of people who actually think that they are fucking the government, and also that they are being a joke. Despite the jokes, there is a lot of stuff that gets lost and forgotten because of the jokes. So I feel bad if there's just this one line that just gets stuck in my head."
95,74,People are not being serious about it.
98,74,"I'm not sure what you mean by that, but the whole post is about a joke, a joke about a joke, a joke about a joke, and a joke about a joke."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,It's a joke and it is a joke.

I don't want to be the part of someone who has to deal with"
74,36,I'm trying to think of a way for people to find humor in a joke.
74,39,"Vaccines are just a joke, but they are a joke. There's just nothing funny about it. They're all jokes, in fact."
74,40,"The whole point of the CDC's new 'Vaccine Advocacy' program is to protect the American public from HIV/AIDS. It's a joke about how the government doesn't have a vaccine to prevent the spread of HIV, it's a joke about how a government has some responsibility."
74,44,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.They're trying to make jokes about vaccines that aren't true. It's a joke because it makes people feel better. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
74,54,This is very interesting. I was very surprised that people like this are not having their heads taken seriously enough before being vaccinated.
74,65,A lot of people make this joke in spite of it. I think the real joke here is the one that actually gets downvoted to hell if it was true.
74,67,"I feel like most people that use humor are getting tired of the jokes and are becoming more and more angry, assuming they're not as funny as people who say things like ""butts for me, and it isn't a joke"" and ""so you are being sarcastic."""
74,69,I would like to add that in one paragraph:
88,74,It is just a joke. It is a joke.
95,74,>It seems that a number of these jokes are more about the people being sick than the ones being healthy.
98,74,"I have a phobia. I just like to wear my masks because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. It feels like an absolute bombastic joke. It is part of the joke because it makes me laugh, not because I am uncomfortable with it."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,I believe it's a joke.
74,14,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke that is made up.
74,33,">I'm pretty sure I have a virus that I think I don't get, and I can't tell if it's real or not."""
74,34,"I was born with a covid phobia and I don't know where you came from, but I'm in denial. I can't even get out of my head. It hurts to not even feel the same way."
74,36,A lot of people don't get the joke.
74,39,"I think the joke is that the doctors want to keep people from getting HIV and not that they have to stay in the country, so that the people who have it will get a real chance to get it and the people that actually get the vaccine would be okay to go out, and the patients will get it. So, they're going to keep people from getting a fake vaccination, and then try to help the people who have it to stay."
74,40,Vaccine Advocacy is an important part of the US healthcare system.
74,44,The article doesn't say whether or not a CDC AMA has done anything in this regard.
74,54,I was in the same situation as my mom and dad in the same situation.
74,65,>It is incredibly important that people wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV.
74,67,I like a good joke. I'm just gonna leave it to you.
74,69,It's a joke because it makes people feel better. It's a joke because it makes people feel better. It's a joke because it makes people feel better.
88,74,I think you know how the joke goes.
95,74,The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a joke because it doesn't have a context and isn't a joke because of what the article says.
98,74,"I feel the same way I feel. I feel like I'm a bit uncomfortable in my own skin, but I can wear my own skin, I just like it, but I can't wear my own skin."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"If CDC does not get the vaccine if they have a virus they should go in and make fun of the CDC. Vaccines aren't for everyone, but if the government gets it and is doing it a little bad, then it's not an easy joke."
74,14,"This is one of those jokes I want to get out of, but I am so afraid to admit it. I also cried after putting on a dick. I'm not surprised to see such a joke. But this seems like such a nice joke."
74,33,>“I think it is incredibly important that people wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
74,34,There is no reason for them to have a vaccine. They will not work if they can't keep people from getting the virus. They will do so by giving people a mask.
74,36,It seems to me that the jokes are more about people being sick than people being healthy. I feel that the joke is about people feeling sick and not wanting to be vaccinated.
74,39,"People think they're making a joke about HIV because they're infected, so I guess that's why it comes across as a joke."
74,40,"In the first paragraph, you put the words ""the most important person in the world,"" ""the highest person in the world"" and ""the most important people in the world."""
74,44,The whole point is that he is trying to make fun of a joke.
74,54,The people that have a phobia of virus infections are largely unaware of what it is and do not understand the implications. I had colitis from the time my wife went to the hospital. I was getting flu from her and she was able to have a symptom but was unable to go to the hospital. I felt a little embarrassed about that and felt uncomfortable about it because I was sick. But vaccinated? That sounds like a really interesting thing to say and I would like to say that there is no way to tell that a meds were given to her.
74,65,I'm not sure what this would be called.
74,67,>I feel like I'm pretty sure I have a virus that I think I don't get
74,69,"I had to ask my dad to get me a mask because he had a swollen throat. He wouldn't go to a doctor's office and have the doctor remove his shirt, he did the same, and he ended up putting it on. He said it's the best time to have a medical school massage. He had a big forehead on his forehead and the doctor was trying to protect him. He put it on his head while he was in the ER, and he said the same thing. It's not the best place to start in"
88,74,"Yes it is a joke, but it is a joke. 'We need to be prepared to run on people's hands, if I are to get sick, I need to yell at people and take them to a hospital and the doc will see that I must be a bad person or else he may not be there.'"
95,74,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
98,74,"CANNOTANSWER: ""...i love wearing my masks because I feel comfortable in my own skin."""
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"Vaccines aren't for everyone unless a person is infected. If you think this is a joke and it's your own body, then don't wear a mask unless it's an axoma or an hcd."
74,14,I love the 'why' joke.
74,33,"It's a joke. It's an unintentional, unsupported joke. There's no way that it can prevent the spread of a virus. It can't even stop a virus from spreading."
74,34,"""Hey, I was really thinking about the one-year-old 'Have you been vaccinated?"""
74,36,"The point of the joke is that they're trying to make fun of the CDC, the CDC needs to get the word out. This isn't a joke."
74,39,">... I feel like I'm pretty sure I have a virus that I think I don't get. I feel like I'm pretty sure I have a virus that I think I don't get. I get a virus and I don't want to get the vaccine, so I don't want to get sick if I'm not vaccinated."
74,40,"There are more infected people than doctors in this country. There aren't the right people. The government just needs to make a move. If they don't do so, I don't think that the government has any responsibility to them."
74,44,There's no problem in the world with people in the US doing things as a joke about what the government is doing.
74,54,"Its a joke about the government trying to sabotage the situation. It's funny that they aren't allowed to get vaccinations, but they are not allowed to use them."
74,65,"The main argument here is that it was for the public's benefit to keep the CDC informed and apathetic about HIV infections, which is a common and interesting joke."
74,67,"You are making an attempt to make fun of the government. You're being sarcastic, I'm just gonna leave it to you. I'm gonna leave it to you."
74,69,">""I know I didn't get vaccinated."
88,74,"The joke in question consists of ""It’s just funny that I think it’s funny that people who wear a mask aren’t going to get the vaccine in the US."" It’s not a joke."
95,74,"That is a good joke, because it doesn't have any context and is a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick."
98,74,I'm not going to get into the context here but in my book the CDC is going to give you an answer to one of the most important questions in the humanities.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,Vaccines are not for everyone unless a person is infected.
74,14,Vaccination is the medical miracle cure for HIV.
74,33,"It sounds like the joke is the joke that everyone can't afford to get vaccines, not the joke."
74,34,The joke is a joke because it's funny.
74,36,">The joke in question consists of ""It's just funny that I think it’s funny that people who wear a medical mask aren’t going to get the vaccine in the US."""

74,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""...I'm really glad I'm not the only one who feels the same way."""
74,44,I would recommend the CDC give this guy the benefit of the doubt and see what the other person thinks.
74,54,>I was in the same situation as my mom and dad in the same situation.
74,65,And the government is not going to fix the problem if he doesn't wear a mask.
74,67,"People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on. If it were me, I wouldn't call it a joke."
74,69,I would like to point out that the joke is not silly. It's a joke because it's about the government trying to sabotage the situation.
88,74,"""I want to be in a good mood, but I'm not going to be able to. I'm gonna go get a cold and get a pt. 2"""
95,74,"A lot of the commenters are using the term ""Jokes."" It is a joke because of the context of the joke, and it's a joke because it's a joke because it is a joke."

101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,I'm not a doctor. I have a scar.
74,14,"I have been vaccinated in the last two years and I have a little scar. It's really weird, but there are a lot of times that you just really think the problem is a lack of an irrational desire to stop it."
74,33,"As someone who has been in a similar situation, I would highly suggest that you consider calling this joke a joke. There are many aspects of humor to be found in the way of saying something like ""I like to tell you what I can tell you when I'm not sick. If I don't get sick again, I will get sick."""
74,34,Vaccines aren't what the government wants. The government has the power to stop the spread of the virus.
74,36,People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on. I would recommend the CDC give this guy the benefit of the doubt and see what the other person thinks.
74,39,It sounds like there's no humor in the joke. I'm sure the CDC has no clue what they're talking about here. The joke is that the people who get the disease who are going to recieve the cure and get infected are going to get better and better.
74,40,"A lot of the commenters are using the term ""Jokes."
74,44,"What do you mean by ""Jokes""?"
74,54,"Yes, they are. The point of the joke is to make fun of those people who have problems with HIV and are getting sick because of their masks. The point is that people who are not vaccinated can and should get the vaccine themselves and not be able to get vaccinated. So, I'm saying that they are not able to get vaccinated because of some health issues they have."
74,65,Is it possible to be a doctor and have a facial mask?
74,67,Vaccines are not a joke. A joke is just an attempt to make fun of the government. They are not what the government wants.
74,69,Vaccine Advocacy is not a joke.
88,74,That's why it doesn't seem like a joke. It seems like people are just being silly and trying to make it a joke.

74,36,Vaccines are intended to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not a joke.

74,44,The point of the joke is that the government is trying to make fun of the government.
74,54,Is it possible to be a doctor and wear a mask?
74,65,"I feel like the most important thing to remember when someone has to get the flu is they are in the public eye. This is about preventing the spread of a virus so you need to stay in it for a few days. I've also never had a scar, a colitis scar, or had any cleft palate or any kind of symptom of the virus."
74,67,"It's hard to have an AIDS epidemic, but it doesn't really matter. You're just not in the right."
74,69,I'm gonna say this:
88,74,In the UK a vaccine for a venomous disease might be needed for some people to be protected. However it has to be approved by the government to help prevent it from spreading.
95,74,And it makes a joke.
98,74,You are quoting the whole phrase 'It seems to me that the humor of a mask isn't a joke. I think it's a joke. I think it's just a joke.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,The CDC is also a bunch of private insurers that carry out the entire travel insurance and prevent and take care of the people vaccinated. It's not the government who wants to make fun of it.
74,14,I think a lot of people in the medical community are just being silly.
74,33,"I don't know, but I can still hear a lot of people saying something like ""This is not a joke. The joke is a joke."""

74,67,People can never understand what they're trying to be.
74,69,"I'm a medic in the US and I've seen this joke a number of times. It's like a joke for people who have no idea what a joke is. You get to do that if you're not a doctor, and you have a fear that the government isn't the one. That's why I've heard of it."
88,74,"If people really wanted to get a vaccine, they should get tested."
95,74,It was a joke because the headline made no sense. It's a joke because it's a joke because the headline makes no sense.

74,33,"I mean hey, do you have any vaccines? I thought the vaccine would help you feel better after a certain age and a few years. It's like saying it's a joke that's like saying it's a joke and you don't want to be at the top of it if you don't have it, you will have a virus and you won't get a tin foil or goggles."
74,34,I think you're reading it wrong. I think a doctor is gonna be the joke?
74,36,I don't like wearing a mask. But you can use a mask that has a hole in it to give people an opportunity to be vaccinated.
74,39,"You can't expect to get the flu when you're a doctor, and you're not going to get it because the doctor can't keep a secret or something, which you can't control and it's all just a joke. It's a joke about people not wanting to get a flu vaccine, and the CDC can't keep people from getting a virus if they're infected."
74,40,"If you don't know anything about this, that is not a joke. It's a joke about the government's failure to protect the public's health."
74,44,I like your jokes... but I feel that I don't understand how the CDC is doing so well in our own country. It's not funny.
74,54,"I've read that it's very funny and a joke that the government does not want to put a mask on, so this is a joke. Vaccines are not what the government wants."
74,65,I'm not a doctor. I'm a patient. I've never been in a hospital setting.
74,67,"It's not funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny."
74,69,Is this part of the conversation about how the CDC is hating on AIDS patients?
88,74,No kidding. I'm sorry OP. You're going through this without any context at all. What are you going to do? Read this post and see what it says.
95,74,"Isn't this a joke? I don't know how to explain this, and I can't believe there's only one headline in there."
98,74,"I think this is a good one. Basically, it's just that I think the joke is just a joke. I don't know why people wouldn't want to make it into a joke. It's the joke. It's not a joke."

74,1,I'm a doctor.
74,14,"A lot of people have been infected with AIDS, and they’ve had a cleft palate removed."

74,34,"What do you mean ""not funny"" because of the fact that the government has the power to stop the spread of a virus?"
74,36,"Vaccines are not jokes, they are just jokes."
74,39,Vaccination is just a joke. They are the CDC's only thing that a person can really rely on for the CDC's sake.
74,40,"Is the CDC ""the only one in the world who is not the government?"""
74,44,"Vaccines are not a joke. They're used to stop people from getting sick, it's a joke about what they can and cannot control. That's not a joke."

74,69,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
88,74,"So, a lot of people are being a bit of an asshole about the way their masks are supposed to look, but the idea of a mask has no place in the joke that there isn't anything funny."
95,74,"I read the headline and thought to myself ""DIdn't that make you feel better?"" and a little bit of humor, it's so clear it's a joke because people are saying it's funny and it's actually a joke because the headline makes no sense. It's a joke because it's a joke."
98,74,>A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,It's a joke because people who have AIDS get it. They don't have the money to get it. They just don't want to be a part of the conversation with the people who are talking about AIDS. It's not about the people who want the vaccines.
74,14,"I think the CDC is trying to get people infected with HIV into getting vaccinated, which they say is very necessary in the context of the disease. The fact that people who have been vaccinated are not getting vaccinated is a little odd."
74,33,Is it actually a joke?
74,34,You can still be a 'Joke' when you don't know what you're talking about.
74,36,I am going to start with the words...
74,39,The joke is not the joke. The joke is.
74,40,"I’m not making fun of the joke, but you should write the CDC AMA about it. You’re making fun of the CDC and the CDC and everyone else in the country that care about HIV, that’s what makes a joke."
74,44,The joke is about government having to get a vaccine.
74,54,"If a doctor were to prescribe vaccines and not have the money to do it, why should they just stop giving them to people who aren't vaccinated and say something like this to make fun of someone who is not vaccinated?"
74,65,"I know that the title is misleading. There's no real context for it. But in the context of this subreddit, there's a pretty specific context for it."
74,67,"What the CDC is trying to stop is not a joke, it's a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS and has made the best choice in treating AIDS."
74,69,"I'm a doctor in the US and I can't go to school without a mask. My doc says the medical mask is for the sick and I've had a lot of bad news about it. What I was doing was basically a joke about the fact that it's not really an issue. He is a medic in a college town, he's not getting it and he has no medical experience. It's a joke. It is not a joke. It's just a joke, and I haven't been to school yet."
88,74,"The idea of a mask has to come from the CDC, and people are going to have to go on a whim and say ""Oh no, we didn't even make the joke!"" Eventually the CDC will just slap a mask on those who want to get the vaccine. Whether or not they're serious about it, if it does t work it doesn't have to be that funny. ''It's silly, but to a large extent it is silly.""''"
95,74,I can't remember the last two paragraphs. It's the first paragraph.
98,74,"I’m so sorry to hear that, but I don’t like how the CDC equates the fact that it’s a joke to a joke. I don’t think it’s a joke at all."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,That’s the joke. It’s a joke. A joke.
74,14,People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on. Those that don't realize they are wearing a mask are so embarrassed by it.
74,33,CDC needs a mask. No. They don't have a mandate and a mandate to get vaccinated. They have to provide vaccines on a case by case basis and they need to get it out of hand if it's necessary to do it.
74,34,"The CDC doesn't have any idea how a ""joke"" is supposed to be a joke? This is about government sexism."
74,36,"""I feel that the whole concept of a medical mask is ridiculous, but to a large extent it is silly."""
74,39,"Vaccines are a joke and it's not that people don't want to get HIV. They want to prevent people from getting it. They want people to get it and not get it. They want to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's about the government. But it's the CDC, and the people who do want it. You can't help them, the government is trying to control the disease so that people don't get it. They want to get a vaccine. But they can't stop people from getting a virus. You don't want to"
74,40,Vaccine Advocacy aims to stop HIV transmission through prevention and awareness and vaccination programs are the ones that have been in the news about the virus and its emergence in the last 100 years. It's a joke.
74,44,"I’m a doctor and I can’t talk about it. I don’t think it’s funny to make fun of the CDC, but it is a joke and is making fun of the government. If it’s a joke and its about the government trying to make fun of it, i’m not saying it’s a joke. I’m saying that the CDC is trying to make fun of the government. But that’s not what a joke is. It’s a joke. I am actually going to tell a joke to everyone else to say"
74,54,I’m going to go ahead and make this all clearer.
74,65,"What do you think about the CDC's decision to publish a report on HIV if the CDC is the only company that has done so so far? I don't think they'd go through that with the headline, but the other comments are pretty clear. They could probably be making a joke about a vaccine as well as a joke about how we aren't able to do it. It's a joke, but the headline is too clear."
74,67,A joke is a joke. The idea of a joke is a joke. They're not a joke. And the idea of a joke is funny because it's funny. It's a joke because a joke is funny. And there's no way to make a joke about a joke. The idea that people are making fun of the government is what makes this joke.
74,69,"The point is that a doctor who wears a mask for a virus is putting a lot of people's lives at risk. They're trying to make fun of it, so it's only silly."
88,74,"I'm a physician in the US. I don't know if I know about this, but I read some article about it. I can't believe that the word is used in this way."
95,74,"I mean it sounds like they got something from the article, but the headline doesn't really say anything about it. You're right, there's a lot of stuff that made me laugh, but I'm not sure what your point is. ""You're just trying to get all the kids to get vaccinated so we don't get sick or get sick."" ""That's a joke because they don't have anything to do with what the article says."
98,74,>I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I don't understand why someone could go out with a mask because I don't like being in public.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

74,14,"I'm sorry to say that I'm so embarrassed, but I have a mask, and I'm gonna go to the CDC to get it back."
74,33,I think people shouldn't be allowed to make jokes about what the government says or does when it makes a joke.
74,34,"People don't like wearing a mask to protect themselves from some kind of virus, I can't stand wearing a mask because I am a kid. I can't even imagine being a fool for not knowing how to fight this virus."
74,36,It's not really a joke because it isn't funny. It's a joke because people are making fun of the government and making fun of them.
74,39,"It's the entire point of a joke. It is a joke, and it will be, and it will be."
74,40,"Vaccine Advocacy is a joke and is not what a joke is. It's a joke and is not. It's just a joke and it's not going to happen. And I'm not sure you've been that well informed of it, but I don't know if you've been that knowledgeable about it. It's the same thing as a joke, that's for sure. It's a joke because it's a joke and the government has a responsibility to protect the public and to keep the public and people"
74,44,I have been to the U.S. with a lot of people who have been to the U.S. with the exception of the president of the United States.
74,54,I'm sorry to hear that.
74,65,It's a joke that's a joke about people being in the public eye and about how government wants to control it
74,67,"A good joke is the most offensive word. If it’s really that obnoxious and mean, I’ll say it. Vaccines are the best option to get people who don’t have AIDS. They are not the best choice to get them. They are not what the government wants."
74,69,Vaccine Advocacy is not a joke. It's a joke because it makes people feel better. The point is that a doctor who wears a medical mask is putting a lot of people's lives at risk. They are trying to make fun of the government's actions.
88,74,A doctor in the US has a jar of jokes all the time and this one makes me want to nitpick.
95,74,It's a joke because people are going to laugh at it because they're not being serious about it.
98,74,It's a joke.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,">A lot of policing is carried out in places like Florida, Florida, and Mississippi involving kids. We need to be prepared to run on people's hands, if I are to get sick, I need to yell at people and take them to a hospital and the doc will see that I must be a bad person or else he may not be there. We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus,"
74,14,"I think the most important part of this is the fact that the CDC's job is to not give it away to those with it, and that there is a reason it is being taken away. It's the only legitimate way to keep this from happening."
74,33,"I think people should know what the joke is about. That's why it's such a bad joke. People are blaming it on the government, not for it."
74,34,"The whole point of the joke is that you are not being ridiculous or anything, and don't like the joke."
74,36,People who wear a medical mask to be sick aren't going to get vaccinated.
74,39,"The entire point of a joke is that you can rely on them, but not on you."
74,40,Vaccine Advocacy.
74,44,People can wear masks because they are uncomfortable and uncomfortable and they don't want the CDC to make fun of them. But they are not going to give a fuck about the CDC.
74,54,"It's pretty funny. It's kind of funny that a doctor says things like that, but it's not funny."
74,65,Vaccines are very important to people as you described them.
74,67,"The whole issue is about what is best for the people, not the government. I don't think that's a joke, but I'm not a big fan of this guy."
74,69,Vaccine Advocacy (Civica) is not a joke A good joke is a joke  because it's about a joke about the government trying to make fun of the government's actions.
88,74,"I was a medical student in the United States and I knew for a fact about the CDC using the word ""mask"" to make jokes about people infected."
95,74,It's a joke that people are not being serious about. It is a joke because it is a joke because it doesn't have a context or make it a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't have a context and doesn't have anything to do with what the article says.
98,74,"I think it's more like a joke, because it's a joke. You don't have a joke but a joke, because there's a joke. I mean, I don't think I'm right, because my phobias are different. But if you don't like AIDS, then you're right. It's a joke."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,Vaccines are not for everyone unless a person is infected.
74,14,"I can't even recall where the ""whole "" point of a joke is."
74,33,CANNOTANSWER](http://www.nhsw.gov/vaccy/2013/01/dlmav_doh_o_u_nsf/)
74,34,">'If a nhsw doctor doesn't know how to vaccinate you, you should report it to the CDC a few weeks later. That's what is called a joke in many jurisdictions - a vaccine doesn't work if you have a health insurance policy in place."""
74,36,"[A lot of policing is carried out in places like Florida, Florida, and Mississippi involving kids. We need to be prepared to run on people's hands, if I am to get sick, I need to yell at people and take them to a hospital and the doc will see that I must be a bad person or else he may not be there."
74,39,Vaccine is a joke.
74,40,A good joke is a joke because it's a joke that people are making fun of the government.
74,44,The whole point of a joke is that the government is trying to make fun of the government.
74,54,"No, the only problem with this article is that the article is based on a very specific context."
74,65,A lot of people make this joke in spite of it.
74,67,Vaccines are not a joke. A joke is a joke because the idea of a joke is a joke. The idea of a joke is a joke.
74,69,This whole article is about a joke about how the government is not doing anything to prevent a virus from spreading. They're trying to make fun of the government.
88,74,"I've heard about the notion that people who are infected with AIDS aren't being considered good citizens. There is something about their stance that they don't like, especially since their stance on HIV is the same."
95,74,"I know that it's the only joke because they're not serious about it, but they're trying to make fun of it."
98,74,"I'm going to take a bit of the same joke and say something along the lines of, ""I love wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I don't understand why people don't like wearing it because I feel more comfortable in my own skin."" and ""I'm a bit of a joker. I love wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin."
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,1,"This is a very interesting topic, but it may not be an appropriate way to respond to the discussion."
74,14,I think he's referring to people who have had a cleft and the scar isn't a joke.
74,33,So you mean you're a doctor and a doctor?
74,34,This article is a joke.
74,36,"I would say the whole idea of a medical mask isn't funny, but to a large extent it is silly."
74,39,The joke is the CDC promoting a vaccine to stop the spread of HIV.
74,40,"It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's not a joke, and it's not a joke."
74,44,People will never be good citizens. The government is just trying to make fun of the people... It's not a joke.
74,54,Vaccine Advocacy is about the government destroying and preventing people from being vaccinated in certain ways and preventing people from catching the virus. They are not just looking at people with virus infection as some kind of health issue. They are looking at people with a chronic 'hug problem'. The government is trying to make it sound like people with a virus are just being vaccinated in the first place.
74,65,The headline is misleading. The CDC hasn't published a report yet. It's likely that the headline is misleading. The headline is misleading. The CDC hasn't published a report yet. It's likely that the headline is misleading. The headline is misleading. The headline is misleading. The headline is misleading. It's likely that the headline is misleading.

74,67,"In some places, I am in the US and there are a lot of sarcastic jokes from sarcastics like ""Vaccines are a necessary part of the vaccines used to stop the spread of a virus. They are not what the government wants."" (http://www.nhsw.gov/vaccy/2013/01/dlmav_doh_o_u_nsf/)"
74,69,"I don't know why you want to be called a doctor, but to me it seems as if they are getting away with that."
88,74,"It's a joke because people don't care about the situation as much as they do about a medical mask. That said, there's no doubt the CDC is going to do something about it."
95,74,No. That joke isn't a joke because it makes people feel better. It is a joke because it makes people feel better.
98,74,I don't know what this is about the humor of a mask but I do think that I've been in a similar situation.
101,74,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
