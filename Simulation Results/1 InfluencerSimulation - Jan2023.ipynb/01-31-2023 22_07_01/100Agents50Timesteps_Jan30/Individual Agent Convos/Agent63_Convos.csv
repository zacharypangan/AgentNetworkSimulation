99,63,"Hmm, I have no idea what he meant by wearing a mask."
63,14,Yes he meant that he has been sent a message that they should wear the mask at their office and not a mask that they are wearing at their office.

63,14,"You might find the movie more intriguing, but it doesn't get that much traction. The story line is similar and I think the reason people are so happy to see the movie is because the idea is so important, that's why people are blaming them. But there's also a lot of confusion, especially since it's on their head, in regards to the way they are doing it."
63,16,It is an issue of health care workers. They are not legally obligated to wear a mask in the event of a death. Obviously that is part of it. It's in the law to be wearing a mask or to help people in situations where you can't get out of a work place and it will be difficult to remove someone.

63,32,"I don't think the order is a good idea at all. It just doesn't seem like it. If the mask isn't on, then what's the point?"
63,41,This is the most fucked up thing I've read in years. I don't even know what they say. Besides the obvious obvious ones (in the last sentence) I do know that we're all in a coma over something so obvious that if they get away with it they will have to show up and ask the government.
63,53,... the government needs to address the issue and make sure that these people have the knowledge and tools necessary to handle the situation.
63,57,If the employee was wearing a mask while in a mask at work he was going to have a hr contact with a paramedic. But thats just a sarcastic excuse.

89,63,...or is it just something that seems like it would work for them?
99,63,"I think you are just trying to be kind to yourself with your opinions. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. My guess is that that part of the 'We need a mask' thing isn't a big deal. You can wear a mask as a santa costume, and as a santa costume for some reason, it does not sound appropriate. You could use a more appropriate description of a ""strange"", creepy movie"

63,27,"I don't really want to have a conversation with someone that just thinks they're being sarcastic, but if you can, then let me get it straight - it isn't a joke. You are a doctor - you've seen a virus on your hand, and you're already on your hands?"
63,32,It's overdue and a bit vague because the cyborg shit job of the movie.

63,16,What do you think he’s getting from this. It’s not like there’s an argument about this and the reason we don’t have a mask on. It doesn’t make it the reason why we don’t have the vaccine.

63,14,The reason the CDC is a tad bit like an official or something is because the president's job is to push the health care agenda through the government. It's not like the Obama administration is a tad bit like an official or something.
63,16,I'm sure you'll find that this is the most popular quote by the people here.
63,19,A lot of people wear masks. But santa wears a mask. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
63,20,A bunch of people are probably just in shock at the idea of wearing a mask.
63,23,There's a reason the CDC isn't getting vaccines here. They've been looking for the best way for them to do it.
63,27,...I've seen a virus on my hand. I think this was a joke.
63,32,"The movie is called a joke. There are two things going on. The first, it's the fact that the CDC has a virus. The second, the CDC doesn't have the vaccine. The third, it's the fact that the CDC isn't doing anything about it. So, what's the point? If you read the title correctly, it's a joke. And the third, if the CDC is doing anything about it, it's a joke."
63,41,"I'm not a doctor, but I don't know that the character's bs, so I think it's a bit weird that he is going to have to show up. I don't know that I'm a doctor, so I'd be a little embarrassed if I saw someone say ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand""."
63,53,I can understand how the joke is. It seems like a joke that people are afraid of. The story of the movie is that it's not a joke. I don't think people are laughing at the idea that wearing a mask prevents people from spreading a virus. That's ridiculous.
63,57,I see what you mean. There's a lot of good people out there.

63,23,... because it's a joke because it's funny.
