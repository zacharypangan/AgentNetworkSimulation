63,41,So the government is still sending a message to the staff telling them to go on their way to help spread a virus?
77,41,"He's a little cocky, but it's a hazard that he might be willing to take on. He's a cocky asshole and he doesn't trust this vaccine."

41,4,"People use the word ""superspreader"" for a joke."
41,9,I believe that people should be in the wrong to wear a mask in order to keep the virus away from other people and to stop anyone from being in danger.
41,21,"No one can tell you that they don't want people to wear masks because they want a safety net for all who are at risk, but only if they are not prepared to work with a gun."
41,25,"It's all about prevention. I'd rather do it than be called superspy, but it has been around a long time."
41,31,The word superheroes was coined in 1888. The word superspreader is used in the modern sense of the word.
41,35,It's a good thing that you haven't shared this.
41,38,"[NAME] is being a bully. He is trying to get his dick shaved, and he is a psychopath and he is getting the most from the santa. And he is trying to get his dick shaved because he is a hypocrite."

78,41,"It is necessary to have a mask to wear, as a workday, so as not to be distracted, it helps to avoid a virus or illness, to prevent sickness, to save the lives, to stay alive. It's in place to keep a healthy body alive, but you're in it, so you'll need a mask to keep it alive, which is what you're doing."
80,41,So it's kinda strange how the government uses a mask to stop a virus spread in the middle of the country. Doesn't the government have a system to make it so that the virus is still spread in the US?
92,41,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

41,9,I would tell you to get an emergency call and stop. I would not do anything you mentioned.
41,21,I'm in a bit of a panic because my mom is sick.
41,25,I wouldn't say the government is a superspy. That is a different idiom from what the word Superspy means.
41,31,What is it you are complaining about?
41,35,"So, the US government is working on something."
41,38,"I don't understand why people are still using a ""spy"" label to describe the type of behavior people are doing."
44,41,"Well... I don't think they know it, because they've been there. It's the government that puts people at risk. They're doing it to prevent the spread of a virus."
46,41,"I was born in Massachusetts, and my doctor had a job with a TB infection. It was so serious that he had to put me in a mask. He couldn't figure out what I was going to do, and I didn't want to make the mistake of having a mouth full with a face mask. I couldn't do anything about it. It was just a joke."

59,41,"""... Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
63,41,This is the most fucked up thing I've read in years. I don't even know what they say. Besides the obvious obvious ones (in the last sentence) I do know that we're all in a coma over something so obvious that if they get away with it they will have to show up and ask the government.
77,41,I don't think it's right to wear a mask when it's not needed. But if it's needed for medical purposes then you can wear it when you're sick or sick if it's necessary.
78,41,I have a feeling this is the kind of thing people don't realize until the very end. It's the type of thing where we're always looking for other people who can take their shit to the vet and then put a mask on them to a point where they're sick and can't get rid of it.
80,41,There's a wiki article here where a doctor describes a person who is sick of a virus with a mask. A doctor will call them if they are sick of a virus.
92,41,"I was not aware of this before, but I was not aware of this policy. The idea that they require you to sterilize your hands on your own is inferred from the facts that the government has made it illegal for the public to do so."
41,4,I don't think it's wrong to wear a mask when you're sick. It's just a way to get away from the public and help people in an emergency.
41,9,What's wrong with wearing a mask?
41,21,"Honestly, I feel like this is probably the biggest part of the issue. I don't think you're supposed to be able to wear a mask when you're sick, but I do know that I will always be able to have a med to look at if I'm in danger."
41,25,This is the most fucked up thing I've read in years. I don't even know what they say.
41,31,The fact that he is in a hospital with a virus doesn't mean he doesn't have any control over it. He isn't even allowed to wear a mask.
41,35,"I am a nurse, and I use to work in an ED in a diocese and a CDC. It's pretty obvious that you are not a patient, but that you are a nurse (and I get it) and you have to be vaccinated. This is not about a mask but about how you are prepared to die."
41,38,> I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated I would tell you to get an emergency call and stop. I would not do anything you mentioned.
44,41,Vaccination is a very popular and well known topic of discussion. I think you've got a really good point.
46,41,I don't think I understand the meaning of ‘supposed to be a tidbit about the government’. What does that say about the federal government?
48,41,>Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion

57,41,"Yes, we need to do this. Its not like we're a troll here, but it is a legitimate idea."
59,41,People wear a mask because there is a virus. Its not an actual disease. People wear a mask to protect themselves from COVI. People wear a mask to protect themselves from HIV.

80,41,"It's an unfortunate situation for the government, because there's nothing to be done about it. It's all part of the system. But it's all part of the system that has gotten us there. And we don't have to have a solution for all the problems that affect us."
92,41,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I don't think that the public should have to do anything except put on a mask. I'm not saying that they are necessary."
41,4,"It is a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated. In my experience you don't have to wear a mask to make you sick."

41,31,I've had to wear masks a few times. Some of the best I've ever experienced are the emaciated victims and the like. They are dangerous. They don't have control.
41,35,You don't think your husband can be a troll.
41,38,"They said this in the wiki article. I'm a nurse and have worked in a CDC, and I can say with certainty that this is the worst time to have to wear a mask."
44,41,Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here?
46,41,I mean I would go to the office and put on a mask.
48,41,"- ""Hey, I just realised you mean a mask is a piece of shit to wear."""
54,41,"I've been in the hospital and I'm still struggling to find a good one. I think your mom is a pedophile and isn't even sure if she is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her. If they didn't have a face shield in the beginning, they would not have a face mask. I'm pretty sure her mom is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her.

57,41,This is what we call the 'Fearless Act of Dr. Smith'.

They're in that position where they can't tell what a virus is, and they're getting a gpa and you can't be able to do that.

63,41,I'm sorry. Is there some reason the CDC has this particular virus? This isn't a joke.

41,31,Vaccines are largely for people who are in a medical position.
41,35,I'm sure a lot of people think the CDC can make this an issue and aren't so sure about how this is related.
41,38,Vaccines are not illegal. They are just not necessary - if your employer gives you a mask it will only make you sick if you have the correct vaccinations - not for the sake of public health. And then that mask won't help you.

54,41,People in the US who don't have a medical insurance can't do their mask on a job. They have a policy of going through an anti-vaccination system and wearing a mask on a job while in a medical facility isn't enough. 'Don't you think it's funny or a joke to joke about being in a hospital and making people uncomfortable? It's ridiculous.

Vaccines and vaccines can’t be guaranteed to stop a pandemic because it isn’t something that can be fixed without medical treatment. The CDC could prevent the spread of the virus.
