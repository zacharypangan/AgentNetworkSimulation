43,17,We need to get it off the ground.
50,43,The CDC wants the federal government to create a law that covers every person in the country from being at a hospital or having to wear a mask in order to protect themselves from virus.
60,43,"If you have a mask, wear one."

82,43,I'd like to agree with the others who aren't getting the meds to wear a mask.
87,43,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,43,"So if I wear a mask and make a joke about my mother that's not good for me to say that i'm not a racist or a racist but I would be too. So I'll say that if you wear a mask and keep distance and think hey i think about it all the time, but I don't think about it too much that I'd do something I couldn't do if I did, but not this time. I want to say that my mom is so out of town that I can make it easier to go with my dad"

66,43,It's a good thing to not see a dr mp.
70,43,"So... I want to give a second thought, what's really the only thing about that? If you're wearing a mask, do it."
78,43,I think wearing a mask is just a way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,43,"I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but the other part is a little confusing."
87,43,"I can't believe how many people here seem to be intolerant of being forced to get vaccinated because their parents are so stupid, and they've become a complete fucking parasite that they don't know how to care about themselves."

92,43,"I have a medical history that I can relate to: ""I have to clean my hands every day from a day to day basis. I do not care for my body. I don't care for my husband who is healthy. He does not care about my family and I have to help my wife. I do not care about his mother's health. I care about my husband. I care about the best interests of my children."""
93,43,"A lot of people wear masks on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run. if someone put their hand on their face and I tried to cut their nose in half, they'd just go out and bite it on the head and fuck it."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,Is it possible that this person is on the subject of vaccines? I think it sounds like a very good idea and they'll probably be happy to get it under control.
43,17,"I'm a conservative but I'm not really a fan of the laws they implemented, so it's not really much of an issue here. But I'd like to think that you've come off as being ""really intolerant"" if you wear a mask."
50,43,"I'm not an idiot, but I really don't like the idea of a federal mask mandate."
60,43,"I'm a doctor, and I'm going to wear a mask on me in the future. It's the best way to prevent my ebola."
66,43,>You've got an upvote. I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
70,43,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. The CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat the spread of the deadly virus at their airports.
78,43,I wore a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
82,43,I think it's the right thing to do.
87,43,Are you sure that these people aren't the same people who were recently vaccinated?
90,43,We need to get this straight! We need this straight.
92,43,There is a law that prevents people from wearing a mask on their return from work.
93,43,"The way it's used, it doesn't necessarily mean it's true."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"I had a friend who lived in Texas who took the vaccine on his return because it would stop the spread of ebola. This was in the summer of 2015 and I saw a man wearing a mask. He didn't have a chance to come in, so he tried to be a good cop, and they were able to do the right thing. He ended up in the hospital for a few days in Dallas and a friend of mine went in the same room every day. He was there when he went to the doctor in Texas. After a few weeks he"
43,17,As someone who's been to Texas this weekend and has been vaccinated with the H1N1 virus it is not a safe place. It has become quite the dealbreaker for me and my family as well.
50,43,"I don't think there's much you can do. If you're a doctor and need a mask, I would recommend it."
60,43,You guys are a joke. You need a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
66,43,"A turban, a head mask, and a mask a mask."
70,43,"I'm not saying I'm not a big fan of the CDC, but there's a huge difference between a medical and a physical one. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. It's basically just a rule governing the travel of people with health insurance cards."
78,43,"It's not a ""good idea"" or ""great idea."" It's just the idea of saying you're sick. You don't do anything wrong."
82,43,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,43,I'm not sure I understand how the AMA is so successful. There is a reason the AMA is so successful.
90,43,"I'm a big fan of wearing a mask, I like wearing a mask."
92,43,Vaccination is not a good policy. It’s a fucking joke.
93,43,Well if you think about it the reason people wear masks is because of a lack of wear and tear. So it's not a joke.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"i would recommend a mask for people with low insurance who do not have insurance, or people who have a health insurance. but it would be a big dealbreaker for those who don't need to travel."
43,17,The only reason you need a mask is because of lack of wear and tear. The reason you need a mask is because you want to wear it.
50,43,"Vaccination is the only cure. The CDC wants to do more to curb people from not being vaccinated. If people have to wear the mask, they are doing it."
60,43,They fucking made me have a bad dream.
66,43,"You sound pretty unprofessional, right? What can I do to fuck myself right now?"
70,43,They just vaccinate you when you wear a mask and they just don't have to.
78,43,"It is not a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke."
82,43,"It is a symptom of a virus. In a world where only ""meds"" are used to prevent the spread of that virus, the CDC should be doing their best to keep the disease at bay. It's not an invasive treatment, but a way to help prevent the spread of this disease. It is not just a medical issue."
87,43,It seems to me that if you can get the vaccinated before you get the symptoms you are gonna get a reaction that is very different from what you are getting with the vaccine. It seems to me that if you can get the vaccinated before you get the symptoms you are gonna get a reaction that is very different from what you are getting with the vaccine.
90,43,>I wear a mask every day. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.
92,43,"I don't understand why people are so concerned about this. I'm a doctor, and I've been told that vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren't required."
93,43,"I was just going to say, ""I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,It's a joke and I hate it when people do it.
43,17,"I'm a doctor. I've been to Texas, one time, and you know what I mean, and I'm pretty intolerant of that."
50,43,Vaccination is necessary to protect children and the environment.
60,43,I don't know how this is even a joke. I'm just looking at the top comments. You're a very smart guy.
66,43,You've got an upvote. I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
70,43,So this guy isn't going to be able to make a joke on us? What would he say if he was in a funk? Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. Is this a joke? Because if I was a funk?
78,43,"Is it the Government? I don't think so. We're just a bunch of jerks, that's for sure."
82,43,"Vaccinating the sick, not the sick."
87,43,I wore a mask outside of a school while vaccinated. I had a sinus infection that went away in no time. I didn't have to have a face mask on. There is nothing unusual about being in the same school.
90,43,"There's an entire section on r/AdultRelationships devoted to the fapping of sex workers to smack the head. There is also an entire subreddit dedicated to the issue of sex workers (representing a particular class of people, stating their identity, their role, etc.) and also articles on what's seen to be a'smoking mask' to be used in the face of the fact that the people who are wearing the mask don't realize it's part of the measures deployed by"
92,43,It's the worst joke i've ever heard. I hate the CDC and their policies.
93,43,"In a lot of ways, I think the question is, are there any things you would call a funk if your mom was wearing a mask? I think there are some things that would make people believe in a funk."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"> ""Is this a joke? Because if I was a funk? Is it the Government? I don't think so."
43,17,There's a lot of things that make people believe in a funk. I don't understand why this is a joke.
50,43,"There is a lot of confusion in my head about what a mask is. I would be more concerned if it was that part of the joke, or if it was some thing more, which is that the issue was not a joke."
60,43,Nope. The government needs a face mask.
66,43,My dad has no problem with wearing a mask and I know what he's doing. He has no problem with going out with a mask because I think he's a troll. I know it's not that funny but it doesn't come close to what he wants us to think about.
70,43,"> We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated.',"
78,43,"It doesn't say ""good idea"" or ""great idea"" because it makes you uncomfortable."
82,43,Is there any way a doctor could be the symptom of a virus that is not a mask?
87,43,I can't think of an article that I like that mentions that people who can't take care of kids are not immune to vaccines.
90,43,> I wear a mask every day. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus. Apparently it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It sounds to me like you wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
92,43,"'Vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren't required. They are not legal. They aren't required. They are legal."
93,43,So I thought the post had been filled with sarcasm.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,This sub needs to end. Don't post it.
43,17,"It's a joke that's used as a way to counter the situation. People will have a hard time understanding what a funk is, but a mask does make them uncomfortable. I'm a fucking child. The H1N1 virus is no joke. The H1N1 virus is a horrible disease and the government is in a really bad position."
50,43,I would say: it's a joke.
60,43,"I can't imagine that a person on the internet could do this to you, or have a face mask for a living. I don't see how you'd even need to be a doc for the entire video."

82,43,The NSA is doing a lot more to stop the spread of the TB and I can't think of a symptom that doesn't have a mask in it.
87,43,I thought they said that a few years back when I was 9 or 10 that I was not vaccinated (here's the list of things that we should do while vaccinated). I just haven't gotten any better than that.
90,43,You guys are a lot different in their thinking besides some of the jokes.
92,43,"Vaccines aren't illegal in most places, and that they aren't required. They are not legal. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they aren't required. They are legal."
93,43,"My family was never in a funk when I was growing up, so that I have to explain that it isn't funny because I'm not in a funk."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"It's not that they're doing it, it's that it's a joke that's used as a way to counter the situation. People will have a hard time understanding what a funk is, but a mask does make them uncomfortable. I'm a funk and I'm not a funk."
43,17,"They have made the H1N1 virus a joke. But not a joke. The H1N1 is an unwelcome viral infection and you need to be infected by a bacterial infection to catch it. The AIDS is a horrible disease, and the government is in a bad position."
50,43,A couple of years ago I read on the radio that the people in question are the most responsible for vaccines. A couple of years ago I read on the radio that the people in question are the most responsible for vaccines. The public is not the only one and they don't need to be vaccinated.
60,43,I want to have a fap myself in a mask as I believe it's a good idea to go in a hat on your face. Not be a joke.
66,43,>I'm going to come up with a good idea. I am going to say I'd never do anything to prevent the spread of HIV. Using a mask is not just a joke.

78,43,"I’m going to have to go on that AMA with the doctor, who will be presenting the results to a panel of doctors in an effort to help the people that were tested to get HIV (I was on a bus with a hammer!), but the problem isn’t with the government, it’s with the government and if he doesn’t tell anyone he’s sick they don’t want to. But he doesn’t know enough about the virus to go out of his way with a mask. I think he’s a joke"
82,43,"The NSA's job is to protect people from the spread of the TB, especially those with TB. They are not doing anything about it. They're not doing anything about the TB."

90,43,"I'm pretty sure that when it comes to viruses, people are being very eloquent about it. A good joke is the one you say is."
92,43,"As someone who has not been to the CDC, I can confirm that a lot of people have heard a good joke about the safety of the CDC, but that it is not legal.

70,43,I am glad you are not the only one who is a little too open and open to any form of public health care. You don't have to come out of your bed with some sort of mask when you come out.

50,43,Vaccination is a medical issue. Not a joke. Just because it works doesn't mean it's actually a joke.
60,43,It sounds like the government is a joke.
66,43,I don't get what'sa joke' is. It's a joke because there's not one reason to go out with a mask. Using a mask is a joke to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke to stop people from spreading it.
70,43,"I just need to understand that I don't actually need a medical condition. I do not need medical services at all to vaccinate myself. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. Vaccination is a warning sign and is effective for preventing infections in the eyes, but it's still a warning sign."
78,43,I don't know about that. I just think it's funny. I don't think people are actually that good at explaining things they don't know.
82,43,"It's a joke. AMA is a shitcast, and it's not a joke."
87,43,I know people who are very good at this and don't if they have any. But the AMA isn't about vaccines. It's about preventing the spread of a virus. That's the whole point of this thread. The AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus. That is the whole point of this thread. The AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus.
90,43,"Is this your first time running, a joke? Because the CDC has zero evidence that it is a joke."
92,43,"No way he's being a joke. The government is causing you to get sick, you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't eat. The CDC is not going to ban them from having vaccines if they aren't properly licensed. The government is fucking up the law, and the government is pushing an illegal policy for the government to make vaccines illegal."
93,43,"i think the movie that makes a good movie is funny because i can't imagine going through a funk with it. It's also funny because i hate the book and just go on and watch the movie because i feel like I can't understand why people would want to take a trip to it. it's hilarious, the movie was good but the movie didn't sound like a good book"
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,People who have been to the CDC for this kind of medical stuff do it. Its a joke to try and prevent a situation. They're also giving everyone to get the flu vaccine.

70,43,I would be more scared if I were not in a funk.
78,43,You don't need a mask to protect your health.
82,43,I think the AMA is really about the government's role in stopping HIV from spreading.
87,43,"My parents are not getting the vaccine in the first place. The people who are, however, are being targeted by their parents because of a virus."
90,43,"I think it's a good way to keep the virus from spreading. It sounds like a joke, but it's not."
92,43,"""Vaccines aren't legally required in most places, and that they aren't required. They aren't legally required. They are not legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."""

43,3,"I'm sorry but I'm in Florida. I'm not very familiar with Texas's vaccine law, so I don't think the people who have had to wear the mask can be legally allowed to do this."
43,17,That's not a joke. It's a joke.
50,43,Vaccination is necessary to protect children and the environment.
60,43,So you think everyone else who has a job as a doctor is a joke? I'm not sure what I would do without one.
66,43,This is an article about a joke that's not a joke.
70,43,"I see this one too. What makes people believe the vaccination is a necessary evil? A ""fucking "" ""machete."" The doctor wants to be convinced that this is a health problem. And so, they've actually been doing it for many decades."
78,43,There's no actual evidence to suggest that the CDC does not have the ability to save or maintain the spread of a virus.
82,43,AMA is about the government. AMA is not a joke. AMA is not a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a gimmick.
87,43,"You seem to think that ""[as a child] [this isn't a joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashing_the_mask) is a joke. I'm embarrassed by my mask. I am going to get a little messy with my hand. No, I have never actually seen a doctor wear masks."
90,43,"I'm a huge fan of putting on a mask, but I don't see what the problem is with this. I like to put on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. I want to go with my dad. It's a bit jarring, but the problem is that when people go down there's no way to tell a joke, they can't even make it to the door - unless they know better than to leave."
92,43,"People don't want to be in the CDC's care because of a lack of health insurance. They want to have a job so they can eat at work, or get vaccinated. It's a joke."

43,17,They're just being dicks for having a life with AIDS. And that means they're trying to get to get to the top of their game.
50,43,I can't stand any of the things in this thread. I don't care what the CDC says.
60,43,"A joke about the government, and a joke about a politician who is referring to himself as a doctor. Clearly, it is a joke."
66,43,This ad isn't a joke. It's a joke about the government putting people in danger and it's really just an excuse to do that.
70,43,>A great many people still wear masks when they work with people who don't have a health insurance card.
78,43,"It's pretty clear that it's not exactly a joke, that's for sure. The CDC is trying to try and prevent the spread of a virus. It's being talked about at length."
82,43,You think that is a joke? Then we should be talking about the government's role in stopping the spread of the disease.
87,43,"We gotta do this because it's a joke, you want to be a joke? AMA is a joke about the government, that's the purpose."
90,43,I wear a mask and bend over. It helps stop the spread of HIV
92,43,I don't know what that means. They're fucking crappy.
93,43,I think this movie is based on the book. But I don't think that's the point.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

43,17,"""Well, in the end, the CDC is the one that makes us all feel like they are a joke."""
50,43,I'm glad I don't have to read the entire thing because I haven't been up for a minute.
60,43,"You’re being a little harsh, but I guess the AMAs don’t give a fuck about being an AMA. AMAs have a reason to be funny."
66,43,I'm sorry but I don't think it is appropriate to say anything racist.
70,43,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. Is this a ripoff of the book?
78,43,"The problem with the AMA is that they are trying to minimize the spread of the virus. It’s not funny or good idea, it is just a joke."
82,43,AMA's are a joke.
87,43,"So if your parents don't get vaccinated, is the vaccine good?"
90,43,"People who wear a mask to keep the virus from spreading, because they feel sex workers are fapping their faces, will make it hard for a non-infectious prankster to try to get it to stop."
92,43,">I think the point isn't to make it illegal, but to rip people off with a lie. My friends who work in public health were not so good at it. My colleagues didn't even know what a mask mandate was, but they did know what a mask mandate was."

101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"No, I don't think that's a joke. The AMA is being done to make it illegal and not to actually work for the CDC in the United States. The AMA is also for the government to get rid of the spread of the virus."
43,17,">I think the point isn’t to make it illegal, but to rip people off with a lie."
50,43,>Vaccination is necessary to protect children and the environment.
60,43,"And yet, in a nutshell, I think they are funny. It’s like saying ""Oh, that’s a joke. It’s just a joke."""
66,43,It’s the same kind of joke that people make when shit doesn’t work - they’re the ones who want to kill them.
70,43,I think it's a great read that you're a little skeptical of the book.
78,43,>I am not a doctor but I work at a hospital and I do not wear a mask.
82,43,"You're right, that's pretty much all the jokes I've ever seen on the Internet."
87,43,I don't want a lot of people to have their parents vaccinated or not vaccinated.
90,43,You're a joke.
92,43,The problem isn't that it's not legal. It's that its a joke and its a way of bringing it up.
93,43,I don't see a reason why people would make the movie because the movie is based off of a book.

82,43,A good way to start is to not use any masks. It's not funny at all. It's funny at all. It's silly at the end of the day.
87,43,"The article is misleading. You're telling a joke and making jokes, unless you are making a joke."
90,43,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,43,I'd just like to say the truth of the story:
93,43,"So, it's not about the movie but it's about how many people wear masks every day."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

43,3,"As someone with a doctor in Texas, who I know is a medical doctor, this makes me think of this kind of thing as a joke."

82,43,"So, a AMA is the one that's all about the CDC if people wear a mask, so that we can stop the spread of a virus?"
87,43,"As someone who recently got vaccinated, I think this is a joke, especially if you are asking for a vaccine, and not saying you get an AMA. I think it’s an interesting thing that people are talking about."
90,43,"No, they aren't. It's the part of the joke where a person, as far as I can tell, takes a break from wearing a mask. You don't need a mask to stop you from getting HIV."
92,43,So why can't you go to work without a mask and ask for one? Because you can do it all day without it and not to look in the mirror? Probably not.

78,43,"I am not a doctor. I work as a pharmacist and have had a few issues. This is a serious issue. I'm sick and I need a doctor, but I don't think it's that bad. It's not funny, it's a joke.

93,43,I think a good piece of commentary on the subject is [I think](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles.png) is something I'm willing to spend a long time pondering about.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,I think we need to make a new tabular comment to let the public know this is about to happen. The person that is being made to be a joke will take it as the real story that's going to happen and I'm guessing that someone who isn't being paid to do it will try to make a new one about this as much as possible.
43,17,I think this is a good question to ask about what the CDC is doing.
50,43,There is a lot of confusion and confusion here. Almost all of the other comments were referring to the vaccine.
60,43,People are taking these jokes as a joke and not an insult. They're not funny at all. They're sexist and stupid.
66,43,I'd say you should be okay with it. But what about the people who make up this joke?
70,43,A good joke. But I don't like the jokes.
78,43,> The whole idea is a joke.
82,43,I think you're just saying that in his first sentence he made a blatant statement about how he was making a joke and isn't telling a joke. He is actually trying to make a joke about what he was saying.
87,43,"AMA is a joke aimed at protecting kids and prevents the spread of a virus. It's about prevention, and it's about preventing the spread of a virus. AMAs aren't about protecting the public. AMAs are about preventing the spread of a virus."
90,43,We need to do a good job promoting the role of the CDC.
92,43,"I'm a physician who works at a CDC for 5 years and is a doctor. But, when a doctor is a doctor, he doesn't need to be a doctor. He doesn't need to be a doctor."
93,43,>Is the OP asking for a comment to change his mind?
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,AMA: People are taking this as a joke. I think the whole idea is a joke. People are taking these jokes as a joke.
43,17,The person is a joke and is trying to make a joke.
50,43,"As a woman, I don't know why people want to hear this joke and not listen to it."
60,43,"The only reason that people would be embarrassed about that is because they believe the government is an enemy, not because of this AMA."
66,43,"Vaccines are being rolled back and rolled back to the health care system and a tool to help combat it. That’s the reason people are afraid of the vaccine, despite it being a health issue. It’s a joke because people believe it’s wrong. Vaccines are the best way to prevent it. But it’s not funny. It’s a joke because it’s a joke."
70,43,A bit of the jokes aren’t a joke. The article is an attempt to elicit a response that would be a bit of a hysteria.
78,43,It's not a joke at all.
82,43,The idea that this is a joke is incredibly interesting to me. The AMA seems like it's a way to make people feel bad unless you're a doctor.
87,43,This whole article seems really cliche.
90,43,"I want to give a snide, funny, silly way to express my opinion. I don't have anything to say."
92,43,"I feel like it's a joke because it is, but it doesn't sound like it's a joke. I just don't know what the joke is about, so I don't have a clue."
93,43,"In my opinion, it's a joke and it's a joke. A ripoff of a book or a book, it's not a joke."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,- I don't have a clue what the joke is. I know it's a joke that you've seen and it's infuriating to hear.
43,17,'Cannot support it unless it's about a joke'
50,43,I read the headline as 'In my head it would be pretty blatantly obvious if the CDC did something like that.'
60,43,"> 'I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I’m not going to get the vaccine in the US. I’ve seen a virus on my hand."""
66,43,He’s a troll and I think you’re overly critical of the CDC’s actions.
70,43,"This guy is making a really silly joke, and even though he's not on the list, he's an absolute nutjob. I would tell him to wear a mask if he wants to get sick or have an allergy and he doesn't really understand how to tell that."
78,43,"> ""The only thing the guy could possibly learn from the CDC in the first place is that it’s not a ""good idea"" or ""great idea."""

92,43,"It is a joke, but not legal. Its not a joke, and is not legal."
93,43,The book seems to be very witty.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"There's a video to this. [As someone with a doctor in Texas who went to the CDC for this kind of medical stuff, I saw a man wearing a mask. He didn't have a chance to come in, so he tried to be a good cop, and they were able to do the right thing. He ended up in the hospital for a few days in Dallas. He was there when he went to the doctor in Texas. After a few weeks he went in, and they are actually a joke. I don't understand why"
43,17,I think the question is: is a person who's just been in contact with people for months without a CDC mask or just a private carrier?
50,43,"A lot of people say this because ""Vaccination is a joke."""

66,43,"The post is full of unintentional jokes about what a turban sucks to wear at work. The title is a little misleading, as it seems like that is in the title."
70,43,I'd say that a lot of people have a hard time getting vaccinated because they don't know how to vaccinate themselves but that this is a joke.
78,43,"“If it was an AMA, that would be a joke.”"
82,43,The idea of an AMA is funny because it's about the government and the government's work.
87,43,"You're being cliche. You think it's a joke. You're just telling a joke, if you aren't a doctor, then you're making a joke."
90,43,''If I wear a mask every day. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.'''
92,43,People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give vaccines in the US. That is illegal and also illegal in many other countries. 'They aren't required to give vaccines' is a joke and not legal.
93,43,It's a great book. I'm gonna go ahead and quote this as something based on the book.

50,43,"""As a man who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask during a pandemic, I'm very upset that you say you would not wear a mask to a party."
60,43,AMAs aren't about the government. They're about their role in stopping the spread of the virus.
66,43,"You sound a bit overly serious, right?"
70,43,"I think that's a great read for a little while now. It's very well written, and if you think the article is a joke, I don't think the title is accurate, but I think the article is a good idea. I'm not sure whether the article has been really written in this way, but I feel like that's a good one."
78,43,It’s actually a prank.
82,43,"Yes, I have heard this before."
87,43,"As a child with a virus that I am allergic to, if I were you, my nose would be bleed out and I would be afraid of infections from a virus. I'm afraid I'd be unable to fight it."
90,43,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.
92,43,"In terms of legality and potential, vaccines need to be legal."
93,43,CANNOTANSWER: I think the movie is a ripoff of the book.

43,3,AMA. AMAs. AMA.

50,43,"You have a little problem with your own mentality? That is, they are saying there is a big misunderstanding between the two."
60,43,"I've read multiple AMAs. Mostly about 'the government' and what its role is, and the idea of being a doctor is pretty absurd."
66,43,Vaccines are the only solution to AIDS.
70,43,I think this is a very good example of what the Obama administration is doing in regard to the issue of getting vaccines. It is a joke.
78,43,"The AMA is a ripoff of the book, and the CDC does not say anything about the ""intentional problem."" It is a joke. The author of the book is a ripoff."
82,43,What AMA is going to be about? What AMA is going to be about preventing the spread of the virus?
87,43,"""The Fight to Save the Children"""
90,43,"It's a joke, but a joke."
92,43,I think the law needs to be made illegal and people are being called out and shit for it.
93,43,So the movie is a rip off of the book?
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,I'm sorry but the AMA was a little off.
43,17,"In this situation, a joke is a joke if we don't make a joke. If you're going to make a joke about something that doesn't affect people and you aren't going to make it a joke about a problem that affects your health, we're just going to make fun of people for putting their health at risk."
50,43,'This isn't a joke because it doesn't have any context and isn't a joke because it's a joke.

70,43,"It's a good joke, but it's not a joke."
78,43,I had this problem a couple years ago where I was sick and I was told I could wear a mask to stop the spread of HIV. I could see why people wouldn't be interested in it and I was joking to myself.
82,43,"Nope, not really an AMA, just a joke about the government. AMA is about the government. What is a joke?"
87,43,I read the following excerpt from The Fight to Save the Children :

101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"I don't understand what you mean by ""sad"" in general."
43,17,I've been to the CDC several times before and we are in the same state and that is where it's at. But I also have a very strong fear that we will be a joke again.
50,43,Vaccination is necessary to protect children and the environment.
60,43,The title of this is about a person who has never made an AMA.
66,43,"""We don't have a government to use, and there is no way that's racist, and there is no way for our public servants to be vaccinated."""
70,43,">The joke is a joke, but it's not a joke. It’s a joke, but it’s not a joke."
78,43,I know that people are joking a little but I think they are saying it's a joke. But they're also talking about how they didn't see that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV if it wasn't actually a joke. It's a joke because it's based on a book.
82,43,"It is a joke, it's a gimmick."
87,43,“It seems to me that if you can get the vaccinated before you get the symptoms you are gonna get a reaction that is very different from what you are getting with the vaccine. It seems to me that if you can get the vaccinated before you get the symptoms you are gonna get a reaction that is very different from what you are getting with the vaccine.
90,43,"OP, I'm gonna say what I like to wear a mask every day. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus. It helps stop the spread of a virus."

101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"The guy who did this is a joke. They don't even care, they know, they're funny. I think he just isn't a funny person. He is in a bad place and they have no clue. He can be called a joke because he has a doctor who does not like that type of stuff. The guy is a doctor."
43,17,Is a mask the problem for you?
50,43,I agree with your statement. The CDC has taken the AMA as a joke.
60,43,AMA is not a joke and it's a joke because the joke isn't a joke.
66,43,"I don't understand what the word turban is for, but I know they are a joke and a joke about the government."
70,43,It’s a joke.
78,43,>You aren't a doctor but I am a doctor.
82,43,I think this is one of the most glaring mistakes that's ever been made.
87,43,The AMA is not about vaccines.
90,43,"""I think it's a joke, but it's not. People aren't allowed to be so frank about anything but a joke."
92,43,I think you've tipped me off and I'll put your hand up and tell you a secret about me: I hate being a doctor. I've been in a CDC for five years and I've heard this story.
93,43,"I'm a guy, not an author, but I think it's funny."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,Isn't that the kind of joke that people are taking to the AMA in general?
43,17,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC and CDC are in Texas. The CDC and CDC are in Texas. 'The CDC and CDC are in Texas.'
50,43,I think the first part of that post should be written with the intent of making a publicized joke about the government.
60,43,"In general, as a person who has seen viruses on my hand, I don't think the virus can be vaccinated because it's a ""tinker"" in my body. It's just an obvious way to protect myself."
66,43,People use it to make up jokes about their own health and are scared of getting infected. But that’s not it. Vaccines are for life.
70,43,"In this case, the CDC should probably be letting people get vaccinations. There are actually good things to vaccinate everyone, and they need to stop that. They shouldn't do that when it's a joke, but they should probably stop the problem and let people go for it."
78,43,"It's a joke. It is a joke. The government has a big problem, not the CDC."
82,43,I'm so sorry but that I'm the AMA that is about the government and not the government.
87,43,Why are you using the acronym [aama]?
90,43,"The problem is that when people go down there's no way to tell a joke, they can't even make it to the door - unless they know better than to leave."","
92,43,There are some laws in Texas that require someone to be a doctor to have a vaccine. And the other laws include those that would not require you to be a doctor or get a medical license.
93,43,I'd be willing to spend a long time pondering why you think the movie is a ripoff of the book.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,The first part is not a joke. It is an idea to make the government look bad and stop them from spreading the virus.
43,17,I think the way the movie is being used is in the title.
50,43,You're trying to make jokes about the government because of one thing:
60,43,A joke is a joke.
66,43,"Vaccines are for life, I'd say."
70,43,"The joke isn't ""a joke"" but ""a joke."""
78,43,"I think the entire book is a joke, and is not the best one."
82,43,AMA is a joke gimmick.

92,43,The current CDC isn't going to change. They are going to be doing things like making a video about it and it is a joke.
93,43,I grew up in a city with a gang that has a few hundred people in it. My mom has a few gangs of people who haven't gotten smacked out of their houses in the city. I would go to a gang of people who are just making a joke about the gangs.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"There are a lot of AMAs that are about the government, not the government."
43,17,I think the film is about a joke and the CDC is being forced to put that into perspective.
50,43,Those words have been spelt in a lot of other places.
60,43,"The word is 'devil nut' and the word is'mash'. It's used to refer to any person who is in a position to be a doctor and if they are in a position to be a doctor, they should be able to say something that is funny and isn't inappropriate.

66,43,"... and ""I'm not saying you're racist or anything, but I don't think it is appropriate to say anything racist."""
70,43,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a fucking warning sign.
78,43,"As someone who works as a doctor and has a few issues, I just wanted to point out that the first sentence is one of the few idioms that come to mind when I was younger. It's the joke that's important to me, it makes me feel ill."
82,43,In what way is it going to hurt to see a syringe in a person's mouth?
87,43,There are a lot of people who seem to be intolerant of being forced to get vaccinated. I think they just don't get it. I've been vaccinated but the symptoms are not the problem.
90,43,"So, wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus is the first step towards reversing it?"
92,43,Is this the same article where you're in Texas? Because this article doesn't cover the exact details but I think it's a joke that's made up because the government is not involved.
93,43,It sounds like you aren't a big fan of the book / movie.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"You're not an idiot, you're an idiot. The article says it's a joke and people would be able to do the right thing."
43,17,"The CDC is an institution that uses humor as a counterpoint to a joke, and that's the joke that the H1N1 virus is not a joke, and that's a joke. Those words have been spelt in a lot of other places. The word is 'devil nut' and the word is'mash'. It's used to refer to any person who is in a position to be a doctor and if they are in a position to cut their own, they are in a joke."
50,43,"People are making fun of their own policies. They are not using the jokes. I think it is better to write about this than it is to write about the people who are using the jokes. They may not think they are making fun of the government. But as I've mentioned before, we can also say that ""people aren't responsible for vaccines."" ""Making fun of a dick's face, so it doesn't mean they aren't responsible."" ""As someone who is not a joke, I've been able to do with the"
60,43,"I think the whole AMA thing is a joke. It's a joke about a joke about an AMA that's about a joke and about a joke about the fact that the guy who wrote it is infected with the virus, but that's just an obvious way to protect yourself."
66,43,"he is getting the jokes in the form of a ""really stupid joke"" and not the ""really stupid joke""."
70,43,I feel like the question of whether a joke is a joke is beyond the scope of this article.
78,43,"I'm an American, and it's an interesting subject. This kind of thing is pretty ridiculous."
82,43,"I don't think anyone said the joke was just a joke. If you're going to read it again, you'll probably see it."
87,43,"I think it's not really a joke, but it's a cliche. ""As someone who recently got vaccinated, I think this is a joke. It's about preventing the spread of a virus."
90,43,A joke? That's a joke. The joke is that people who wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

43,3,He's wearing a mask. It's not illegal and not against the law.
43,17,"They need to stop putting people in a position to be able to get the CDC into place as soon as possible. The CDC hasn't said anything about that, but is trying to put it on the agenda in the book."

93,43,"It's very interesting to see a ripoff of a book. The book is based on the book and if you can't retell that, you need to have a book based on the book. It is based on the book and the book is based on the book."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,"I'm sure there are people who would think it a joke if AMAs would be about the government, but I'm sure there would be a few people. Like ""As a friend of mine in Texas who took the vaccine on his return."""
43,17,"They've already stopped a CDC and AIDS in Texas, and it's a joke. They're using it as a counterpoint to the joke."
50,43,"In my opinion, it is very strange. You can wear a mask and I wouldn't want people to be able to say you're a doctor. I would not consider the CDC to be a joke because I believe the CDC is doing the right thing."
60,43,"AMAs are an attempt to hide the joke – the ""people who are in a position to be a doctor and if they are in a position to be a doctor, they should be able to say something that is funny and not inappropriate. That's a joke."""
66,43,I'm going to have a friend give me a name-call to see what I think I am going to do with the AMA. It's a joke about the government and not the people who think it's funny.
70,43,">What makes people believe the vaccine is a necessary evil? A ""fucking "" ""machete."" The doctor wants to be convinced that this is a health problem. And so, they've actually been doing it for many decades."
78,43,"Basically, that's not a joke. I mean, it's not a joke. It's a joke."
82,43,There are only four words in an AMA. The AMA is a joke.
87,43,"I'm assuming that's how many people in this thread are getting sick, or at least have gotten better from a vaccination, and how many people are not getting vaccinations."

92,43,">We have to remove all our masks and scrub our hands with them. You need to have an MRI, a washcloth and a plastic bag, a mask and a pyjamas."
93,43,"The author is trying to get the movie, and I'm referring to the way he is using it."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,What a joke. And you don't care if the doctor said it was just a joke.
43,17,"Yes, I think you are right. It is a joke and an attack on health and the safety of others. I've heard that if you are in an organization containing a lot of health information about AIDS in a medical setting, you'll have to do that. I am a doctor and I can certainly agree with this."
50,43,> The AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's about the government's actions. It's a joke because it's about the government's actions.
60,43,That's a very good point and it's also about the AMAs being done by the government.
66,43,"> I’m not a doctor, I am a CDC doctor and I have a problem with HIV."
70,43,I’m gonna start with a question. Why does the CDC care so much for vaccines?
78,43,It sounds like the entire issue of this movie is based off of a book.
82,43,So you're saying that 'AMA' is about the government and the government's work? 'What AMA is a joke gimmick? '.
87,43,"It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. I don't see why anyone should be able to say ""no"" when the AMA is about protecting the public."
90,43,"You mean you're not a joke, right?"
92,43,I'm a doctor who's not in Texas.
93,43,It sounds like someone's trying to make an argument that the movie is based off the book.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,Is it possible that this guy is wearing a mask?
43,17,"I can see why some people in Texas have their friends, but the ones in the United States haven't been diagnosed yet. I'm not really sure what the real word is -"
50,43,"I believe the phrase ""Making fun of a dick's face"" is actually being used in a joke. It is an obvious joke."
60,43,"Because, while you may not be a doctor, you don't need a mask. If you are, it's your duty to wear it, and if it's the right thing to do, you should wear it. It's not going to stop it."
66,43,[Footnote 4](http://www.cdc.gov/sdc/)
70,43,"You 'DON'T get it''because I'm a little skeptical of the book''. ''What makes people believe the vaccine is a necessary evil? A ""fucking "" ""machete."" ''"
78,43,"Considering that the movie is based off of the book, it would seem to be the more important one, and more relevant. It's also funny that you have an idea that would be very popular."
82,43,"This was the first time I ever wrote an AMA, and I felt like it was a joke. It was only a few weeks ago."
87,43,It's about preventing the spread of a virus.
90,43,"I'm a doctor. The Doctor knows that the medical community has the right to tell people a joke about AIDS. It also helps prevent the spread of it. CDC, in his case, is not going to go ahead with this, especially with the information the CDC provides."
92,43,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: 'I don't believe that the CDC is in Texas. It's illegal because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are illegal because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities."
93,43,">, ''(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles.png) is a good piece of commentary on the subject is ""[I think](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles.png) is something I'm willing to spend a long time pondering about.""'', '[I was just going to say, ""I'm not a santa or a clown. I don't think]"
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,People who are on the subject of AIDS aren't going to be comfortable if you voluntarily wear a mask in public and it won't affect them.
43,17,A mask is just a mask and a joke. A CDC has no legal authority to make a CDC-style joke and no one should have to wear one. It’s only a joke when people are forced to take advantage of it in order to keep people in a position to stop the spread of a virus.
50,43,I'm just talking about some weird stuff that happens in the US and a lot of people in our country don't understand.
60,43,That's a joke.
66,43,It's just about bringing out the best in people.
70,43,A joke is the phrase used to refer to something that is actually true and the same to be a joke.
78,43,"""I was a doctor and I don't wear a mask in public. I don't have the health insurance. But I don't want to be sick."""
82,43,"Yes, they make a fun, hilarious, and engaging way to go with the government to make it fun - and at the same time they're not."
87,43,I am in no way a doctor. I am very apathetic.
90,43,"[non-judgement], in which a doctor in a rural area says that ""A man wearing a mask in public can't help stop people from fapping his faces, because he feels the need to fap his hands, but it isn't a joke."" The person who said it was a joke (and it's not) is a joke (and it's not a joke) and isn't an actual joke."
92,43,"This is the joke that has been running for a couple of years. I’m a doctor in Tex. It’s illegal to have a vaccine in the state, but you can’t get a vaccinated person to be a doctor."
93,43,A lot of people are getting mad at this because they didn't realize the book and the book is based off of it.
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,3,I think they are pointing out that this is the kind of joke that a doctor in Texas is doing. They think that the person doing this is just a joke.
43,17,I'm gonna look into the possibility that the person wearing the mask is also a doctor.
50,43,"In this particular case, the first part of your sentence says that a mask is the problem. It's a joke because it's about the government's failures. It's about the CDC's failures to prevent HIV."
60,43,That's a joke. I'm a doctor and I'm not a joke.
66,43,"""I'm not sure I'm right and I'm just going to go get a vaccine for my kids."""
70,43,"Why are you so surprised this is the only one i could think of with my left side thigh, I'm just so amazed this is not in the book, it's very interesting."
78,43,"a lot of people with AIDS, who would like to get tested, don't understand this and think it's a joke, and don't understand it"
82,43,"[NAME]'s post is really about how AMA's are jokes. It's about the government, CDC, and the world's population."
87,43,"AMAs have a similar value for the public, even if it's about the government."
90,43,"That was pretty weird for me to understand, but it was just a joke."
92,43,"It seems like the best joke of all time is ""I'm not a doctor."
93,43,"It's funny to be in a funk. Like, I drank my coffee or something. I'm going to watch this one now, but not the whole movie. It's a ripoff."
101,43,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
