Hopefully this will save you some time and a lot of money."

A med center in Canada is the first place I would look at a medical shield when I walked off a flight. I had a mask on when i was a kid and it didn't help with the virus. It sounds like a very small chance that someone with HIV or even a HIV patient would end up with the virus. It's a real thing. The government is a bad tool.
77,39,"So, what do you think of a NSA?"
78,39,"I agree with your whole point about the medical masks. The US has a 'bad tool' (a mask for people with diseases to vaccinate for, or with vaccines) but not for everyone to have it."
87,39,"They have put a lot of focus on it now, as if they were going to cut people off because they couldn't take it anymore. Certainly the gov't has pushed to keep their kids vaccinated."

61,39,"I believe there's a problem with that as well, that's because the joke is about something important like HIV in the form of a medical condition or something. It could also be about a person taking part in an attack or something."
74,39,I don't think a CDC person could put themselves in such a situation. They need to fuck it up and take down the people who are trying to get away with it.
76,39,">Isn't this part of the ""I don't like the stigma"" joke? Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus."
77,39,">'I'm not a doctor but I'm also not in the public sector so I am not really sure if that is what you mean.', ""I'm not a doctor but I'm also not in the public sector so I am not really sure if that is what you mean.''"
78,39,I'm not trying to devalue the entire message but as a man in a hat and as an AMA I think you're an idiot.
87,39,"I am not a doctor, but I have no problem with not being vaccinated, but the fact is I have an extremely hard time understanding why people say things like ""They have put a lot of focus on it now, as if they were going to cut people off because they couldn't take it anymore."""
93,39,"As a non author, I can attest to this:"
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,Vaccines are for life. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
39,14,I don't think the point of the AMA is that the government is trying to help protect children. That's a valid question.
39,19,"What's funny is the AMA. It seems to be about vaccination. It doesn't really say ""but we do need to get vaccinated""."
39,28,"If it comes down to it, it has nothing to do with ''the AMA''', not the fact that you feel like it's a joke or a joke, but it does with 'the joke'' or 'the book'', and so it's about the people in control. ''Tis about a joke. Why'' is that you feel a joke?''"
39,29,"No, the AMA is not racist or racist. It is a serious joke and it is not about the AMA, it is a big piece of shit and I have a hard time believing that. 'Is there anything wrong with wearing a mask? Is there anything wrong with wearing a mask while you are out? Is there something wrong with you doing something that is wrong with you?'"
39,33,"""We are not doing the right thing. We are just going to have to cut them off, and stop doing it."""
39,36,"I think that it is just a fucking joke, but I think it is a joke that the AMAs aren't about anything more than protecting the child from the government's intervention."
54,39,"""I'm really embarrassed to see a person who does not have the right to wear a mask, but I am very ashamed that a person doesn't wear a mask because they have the right to.

59,39,The first line is what he said and it was a joke he said and was told about.
61,39,I would be scared. Not even a little.
74,39,"I like to wear my masks. Because I've heard about the AIDS side effects of the mask, but can't recall what's going on. I wear a mask on my face, and they have never worked for me."
76,39,"The article was written by [Eric Yin, CDC Commissioner of Health for the Federal Bureau of AIDS, [http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/viruses.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/statutes/viruses.htm)."
77,39,"I don't know if it's a joke. And i don't know if you should, or shouldn't say it, but I think it's an AMA. It's about the government and the way it's using it, not the vaccines."
78,39,I'd say it's a joke.
87,39,No. The AMA is really about saving the lives of people who haven't been vaccinated. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public.
93,39,"CANNOTANSWER: It is kind of ironic that Santa doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The book is good, but it's not about the movie."
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,"The only good joke, but I think it's important that people get tested before getting vaccinated. If you need to go, you must, of course, wear a mask, otherwise, the CDC will stop."","
39,14,"The article has nothing to do with the AMA, but it is the topic of a discussion on the federal government's anti-spam program."
39,19,... because there's actually a link somewhere that states the government has not started any vaccinations as part of the AMA to prevent TB.
39,28,"CANNOTANSWER: I've never actually seen a rip off AMA about a government policy, so I'm not sure what's so weird about it."
39,29,People are being a little misogynistic.
39,33,"AMA was written by a man who had a phobia of the word ""machetes"""
39,36,"I can't even recall how long it took to get vaccinated for TB, or who went with them when they were being diagnosed. But I do remember that if you wore a mask to avoid spreading it you could be a little nervous, that is what is going on and I think people should be able to get out."
54,39,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
59,39,I think the jokes in that subreddit are really good ones. They could be quite funny for the oblique section.
61,39,"I'm a teenager. I have a friend who is a virus-familial. He's a doctor, but has a bad case of influenza. He's a guy."
74,39,"Vaccines are intended to stop the spread of HIV, so there's no one on the list who doesn't want to see them, so why don't we all wear masks?"
76,39,">I'm not sure if you're being a dick at all, but a bit of a joke. I'm just joking. I'm trying to explain to you why we have to wear the CDC’s health system to prevent the spread of a virus."
77,39,"It's not a joke. The AMA is a joke about how government, CDC, and the world's population is making fun of us."
78,39,It's not a joke but an honest joke.
87,39,"I’m not sure what the point is, but I think it’s funny that the AMA is a joke, based on facts and facts."
93,39,"There's nothing hilarious about wearing a mask on a run, but what I saw in this movie was about one of the people getting a rash. I thought it was an amazing idea, but he said he was wrong about the real fucking story."
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not sure if you're being a dick at all, but a bit of a joke."
39,14,"In all fairness, it is probably not a big deal. People who don't have that much confidence in the government can just go for it."
39,19,"People are raping the government, and the government is making fun of them."
39,28,"A lot of people are still going to argue that AMAs are not a joke, but a joke."
39,29,The jokes in that subreddit could be quite funny for the oblique section.
39,33,I like a lot of faqs that have no problem with being a racist because of their hate of the word and their willingness to be racist about it.

61,39,"So a kid who wears a mask in public just wants to smack you with it in the face, like a little girl with a little girl smacking her and her friends. He's already going to be in danger for being infected. And then, he's going to be in a hospital to get some vaccines for himself and his friends. Is this a joke or a joke?"
74,39,"In some cases, it's simply a joke."
76,39,It's a joke and you should take your apologies in the face of the article — it says there is nothing he can say but he's being a dick. He says that a CDC mask is a bad idea because of the stigma that can be attached to it. But it's also a joke because it's only a joke and is a joke.
77,39,CANNOTANSWER is just an example of a government agency that uses vaccines to stop people from spreading a virus.

39,14,They are going to make the AMA out of what you've said. The AMA is an attempt to stop people from getting sick and making the jokes about the government. The AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus. The AMA is just a joke. The AMA is a joke. AMAs and AMAs for health are not jokes. They are part of the government's policy to combat viral infection. The AMA is based on facts.
39,19,AMAs are a joke. It is based on facts. I don't even know what they're about.
39,28,I'm not talking about the real issue of the mask. This is all about the person in control and how they react to their own health and behavior. I am just saying that the idea of a mask being a joke for the majority of the population is a ridiculous idea.

39,19,"I am a doctor, and I am a doctor. I have a hard time getting a diagnosis for an acute TB symptom. I was not vaccinated or diagnosed with it."
39,28,"AMAs aren't jokes, but a joke. A lot of people do."
39,29,You are all being a little misogynistic and misinformed.
39,33,"I think there's a point that the people I know are being really offended by this, particularly considering the fact that they all just are not good at what they do."
39,36,"No, I don't think the whole AMA was a joke."
54,39,"No, they're not. You have a legitimate reason to believe that you do. But you don't need to believe that. You are being stupid. 'I think it's a joke. The government is using it for a political advantage and is allowing people to pretend they're doing something offensive to them.'"
59,39,"You should never be in an HIV/AIDS subreddit. It's a ripoff of a book. AIDS in general, a joke that does not exist in the US. There's an AMA in Texas that goes from people who have already been in HIV/AIDS to people who have gotten vaccinated. There's no reason for someone to think that you're a joke."
61,39,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: Is 'The Mask' a joke? Because I've seen the movie before and have never heard the movie."
74,39,"There's nothing funny about a joke, just the one about the CDC trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
76,39,“It’s a joke.
77,39,So this is about a government agency? I'm a public health professional and it isn't about vaccinations.
78,39,"OP, this is a really good question, and I would not like to give advice based on that."
87,39,"I grew up in a town in New Mexico that has a medical school that offers vaccinations (it's a private school so I don't know much about the topic), so I would not want to be a joke about this."
93,39,"I think the author would rather that it is an excellent example of what a ripoff is, then the commenter would rather the commenter disagree with the original author's words."
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,"I have seen the AMAs of people complaining about the doctor's vaccination but none of them genuinely mention it as a joke or to use it as an excuse to say they did it because of their own health. I don't think the AMA is racist. I think it's a joke because it's based on facts, but the AMA itself is not a joke."
39,14,"As the first sentence suggests, I am a CDC employee and I cannot speak for all medical workers that haven't had an HIV/AIDS infection. I just wanted to point out that the article didn't mention the AMA in any way, so I did read a bunch of stuff that could not be attributed to the AMA."
39,19,I was referring to the fact that there was a link somewhere that said that vaccines are not effective because of what it was supposed to be about.
39,28,"CANNOTANSWER, MD, a doctor at a public health school said that they didn't wear a mask at all and that they don't think it's a joke."
39,29,"There are other AMAs you could write in, including one about AIDS, that are largely about how they treat AIDS and whether or not they are true and valid. A whole lot of these posts are a bit of a delusional one. But, these people really aren't going to agree with what they are proposing, despite their own comments."
39,33,"I'm really sorry that the AMA was slanted so strongly. I think it's the truth. The idea of an AMA is about helping people who have been in a pandemic get healthy and avoid the spread of infections, and I have to say it doesn't make sense."
39,36,"The whole AMA is pretty much what was written by a doctor who was vaccinated. Using the phrase ""I think you're being too sensitive."" and not just some vague thing."
54,39,You are being sarcastic.
59,39,"This is not a joke, but a joke. What's a joke."
61,39,"i'm sorry, but the joke is a joke, I think you've probably never seen the movie."
74,39,"Well, the point of wearing a mask is to stop the spread of a virus."
76,39,"'I'm not sure if you're being a dick at all, but a bit of a joke. I'm just saying that I'm trying to explain to you why we have to wear the CDC’s health system to prevent the spread of the virus.'"
77,39,"AMAs are about how government, CDC, and the world's population are making fun of us."
78,39,"The article said the AMA was about the CDC in 2009, not in the book."
87,39,AMA's are a joke. They are just a joke. The AMA is about protecting the people. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. The AMA is a joke.
93,39,I like the idea of wearing a mask as a way to stop people from being sick so I could be able to have food delivered and make some money off the ripoff. Then he said he thought it was hilarious because it was a ripoff of the book. And that he was wrong about the book and it makes my father grin.
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,"I think you might have read a lot of this book as racist and if you don't, it's a bit more racist than it sounds. It's about the people and it's a real joke."
39,14,"The AMA is about the government's policy to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I grew up in a town in New Mexico where there is a medical school that offers vaccines, and the AMA isn't based on facts. The article said it was about preventing HIV/AIDS in 2009, not in the book. AMAs are about the government's policy to combat viral infection. The AMA is based on facts."
39,19,"Well, the first sentence is a joke and a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
39,28,AMA's aren't a joke. They are a joke. They are about protecting the people and how they treat the people. It's about protecting the government.
39,29,"It's a joke, it's not. You can't do anything about being a joke. I'm just saying that the AMA's are about protecting the public and making fun of the government, and in a way, people are making fun of the AMA."
39,33,My favorite part of the AMA:
39,36,"I have to give up a lot of sarcastic ideas for this. I think it's great that the AMA is going to be something that is a real joke, but I'm worried about not getting it. I think it is ridiculous and that the AMA is too vague."
54,39,This is about a joke that the government has been using to get rid of the HIV virus.
59,39,Vaccines are for life. The best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting sick. The best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting sick. There's nothing they can do to help protect the public from sick people.
61,39,"I'm just gonna say a word: ""I'm glad I'm not the only one that is going to smack someone in the face when they're sick."""
74,39,"In the U.S. if it wasn't for people getting HIV, there would be more than a few people who were sick, and that would be a great way to prevent people from getting HIV."
76,39,"The CDC isn't the one to blame, and it's a joke. They don't like people who don't have enough information to be able to prevent a virus from spreading."
77,39,"A AMA is a joke, the idea that a lot of people would be allergic to a mask and would not wear it unless they had been treated vaccinated is a joke. It's a joke."
78,39,"> ""I'm not sure if they've been able to explain it to you or not. It's a big deal."","
87,39,"Its the fact that a lot of people aren't aware of how much the AMA is about, and that its a joke."
93,39,"A rip off of the book would be an excellent example of how a joke can be made into a real life movie. I've heard a few jokes about it, and I don't think they're funny. But it's definitely not a ripoff of the book. I'm more confused than you."
101,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,6,"I smack people in the face when I'm sick and I'm sick, but I have to get tested to make sure I don't get the virus."

74,39,"I think the joke is just a joking, as it isn't about that virus at all. Rather, it's more about how to prevent the spread of the virus. Isn't that a great joke to tell, because it's just a joke if people don't like it?"

39,19,"AMA is a joke and a joke about the government, unless it's about vaccines."
39,28,"They are a joke. The AMA is a joke and it's about promoting self care to keep people from getting sick. It's not a joke.

78,39,A great doctor is going to be making the mistake of being an AMA.
