87,75,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
98,75,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
75,3,"I never wear a mask when I'm outside. If it's a freaking pandemic like a hurricane, I usually wear a mask."
75,5,In addition to how it makes you feel a little bit safer and safer in public.
75,6,"I don't wear a mask, I just wear a mask"
75,10,OP you are in the minority of the majority of the population who get sick from a pandemic.
75,21,a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
75,23,Do you think people who are vaccinated shouldn't wear a mask? Because it could be just as dangerous as you'd think.
75,24,And I get to go with you.
75,25,"I am going to tell you a story, i went to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic"
75,36,You are a pandemic!
75,45,I went to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic.
75,50,"I think he s trying to imply that a pandemic is not a pandemic, and not that it isn't a pandemic."
75,52,This is not the first time a post has gotten this far...
75,53,They don't know. They're just not smart enough to care.
75,57,I would go out of my way to show my respect to people who are a total narcissist and will inevitably suffer the same thing.
75,59,i wear a mask outside when i don t have a full body vaccine because i don t know if i ve been sick or if i wear a mask when i don t...
75,60,"No, it doesn't bother me."
75,72,"A person who wears a mask during a pandemic can be really, really uncomfortable if they're not in public."
87,75,"When I was younger, I remember wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because I had a cold. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be vaccinated, but I just did what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."
98,75,"It's not really that important a term. A fat lip and a man without a face, or some combination of both, can both be a sign of an autoimmune disorder."
75,3,The answer is that you are not in the minority of the majority of the population who get sick from a pandemic.
75,5,"So in fact, the pandemic is in fact a pandemic. In my experience a pandemic is a shit pandemic if it happens again."
75,6,If I'm not vaccinated a pandemic is not pandemic and I'm immune to a pandemic is just a virus?
75,10,I don't have the health insurance.
75,21,I'm in the minority of the majority of the population that got sick from a pandemic.
75,23,"I think he is trying to imply that a pandemic is not a pandemic, and not that it isn't a pandemic."
75,24,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,25,"OP, you are a pandemic."
75,36,You know what? That's not a pandemic. This is one of those things that the governments don't care about. Especially since they don't realize the dangers of pandemics. You are not going to get a response.
75,45,I think the word pandemic is meant to refer to a pandemic that can be caused by the pandemic in the same way that an illness can cause the pandemic. It's not inherently bad but it should be understood.
75,50,"People with pandemics don't need a mask, they need a mask that catches them off guard. This is where people are going wrong, and the truth is that there is a pandemic."
75,52,"I'm not blaming anyone but those who've been in the news for decades and were in the hospital recently because they were sick from pandemics. If you think someone is going to get sick from a pandemic, they are probably thinking that people who aren't going to be vaccinated should go. It isn't a pandemic and it does seem like you have an autoimmune disorder."
75,53,Are you a pandemic pandemic victim?
75,57,"I'm going to say it all : If you want to be able to wear a mask while you're vaccinated to help stop a pandemic, that's a good idea. But a pandemic is an actual pandemic and no one should be able to avoid the spread, especially in the case of pandemics."
75,59,So what do you do to stop people from getting sick from a pandemic?
75,60,So you wear a mask outside and then you do not want to go?
75,72,"In this case, it sounds like he's trying to imply that they shouldn't wear a mask, especially as he explains the implications of a mask."
87,75,"My mom told me when she went outside with her doctor she would be so frantic about it that the doctor wouldn't even let her in the door to do something else. I asked her if she was allergic or if she was concerned about me not showing up when she went in and said, ""Well I don't want to see a doctor to come if I have a cold. I'll take it and tell you something - you'll not get vaccinated. I'm a woman who is allergic to children, and they have to be vaccinated"
98,75,"It’s a joke, but a joke."
75,3,When is it not a pandemic?
75,5,People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,6,"A pandemic is not a pandemic. Pandemics are the ones that are not pandemics. You're a pandemic victim, not a pandemic."
75,10,"When you're sick, go to a party and don't wear a mask."
75,21,"It's a joke, but a joke. This is the world's first'shit pandemic'. I'm not a pandemic victim. This is not the world's first'shit pandemic'."
75,23,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,24,I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
75,25,"That's the reason that pandemics happen. If you're allergic to anything, you go to the hospital, or go to the doctor in the hospital. If you're a pandemic victim, the doctor is a pandemic victim. You don't have a mask. You wear it."
75,36,You can wear a mask outside and you can't help them. People in the US are so afraid that this kind of exposure is going to make them sick.
75,45,This is pretty much what happened. People were really worried that a pandemic was coming and the government wasn't addressing it. I think this is a joke because you're a pandemic victim.
75,50,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,52,"Well, I gotta say that this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics."
75,53,I think he's trying to imply that the government isn't trying to stop the spread of a pandemic. Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,57,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,59,The joke is that it's a joke. It's a joke.
75,60,"> I'm a woman who is allergic to children, and they have to be vaccinated. It’s a joke, but a joke."
75,72,The reason why you're getting sick from a pandemic is because people who don't need it don't think they can stop it. They want to help with it and they want to help it. It's not a pandemic. It's a pandemic.
87,75,I was the same way a lot of the time in the mid 1990s and my daughter was vaccinated so she could be vaccinated and go to a doctor or something.
98,75,I’m going to go give you some basic advice.
75,3,Vaccines aren’t needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. The joke is that it’s a joke.
75,5,> People don’t want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,6,As a woman who was vaccinated for pandemics I can say it is not a pandemic. It's a joke. But people don't like to think about the vaccine as something to be ashamed of.
75,10,"> I'm a woman who is allergic to children, and they have to be vaccinated."
75,21,"Yes, people who are going to go to the party don't really need a mask in case of a pandemic."
75,23,You don't... because people who don't need it don't think they can stop it. They want to help with it and they want to help it. It's not a pandemic.
75,24,I am not a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
75,25,I think this is funny because it is.
75,36,"I am not saying the government has a right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. We have the rights to be concerned about it. This is not a joke, it is a joke."
75,45,I'm not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. Is this a joke? Vaccines aren't needed. A pandemic isn't a pandemic. They aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,50,"If you're sick, you need to wear a mask. A mask is not a joke, but a joke."
75,52,"I think the problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
75,53,What was that? There's a naysayer in there that is not a really good doctor despite how he has dealt with pandemics and it's a huge scam.
75,57,"A pandemic is not a pandemic, a pandemic is not a pandemic, a pandemic is not a pandemic, a pandemic is not a pandemic, a pandemic is not a pandemic."
75,59,It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.
75,60,"I'm not sure how many people are being treated with the word ""jail"" in the language of the article. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics."
75,72,I'm a big fan of the joke. I think this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics. I think this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics.
87,75,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe.
98,75,My dad wore a mask as a child but I was the only one that wore it to a public event. It was an excuse.
75,3,"If it's a pandemic, or if it's an emergency, and the mask is worn in a public place, the mask is an excuse."
75,5,I'm not saying the government has a right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. We have the rights to be concerned about pandemics.
75,6,You have a virus? Or do you want to avoid it? It's a joke.
75,10,">I don't have the health insurance."", ""When you're sick, go to a party and don't wear a mask."", """
75,21,I think it's a joke because it's not in line with what a joke is.
75,23,I am not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
75,24,"If you want to stay out of the house, vaccinate yourself before the next one 'If you want to go, I can help you.' If you want to stay out of your house, I can help you, but the next one won't."
75,25,People like you can’t just stop being sick if they aren’t at the hospital.
75,36,It's a tad too cheesy.
75,45,"I think it's more of a joke that this govt wants the government to fix the issue, rather than a thing to be ashamed of."
75,50,"I'm not gonna lie, I thought that was a really good joke. It's not just a joke, it's a very good one. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not that they can't get a vaccine, it's that they don't want to be a faggot because they can't get the vaccine in the first place. And they don't want to be a giant dick for a small number of them."
75,52,Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.
75,53,Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,57,I'm a big fan of the joke.
75,59,"Why do I think they think it's funny when they make the point that you can't wear a mask when you're sick, because you're sick, and because you're not a pandemic victim? Because you don't know the answer, and they're not the naysayers."
75,60,I think the joke is a joke.
75,72,"Yes, a pandemic is not a pandemic. A pandemic is not a pandemic."
87,75,"When I was younger, I remember wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because I had a cold. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be vaccinated, but I just did what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."""
98,75,"No, it's not. It's a joke. You can be funny, but that doesn't change the fact that people use it. So basically the government wants you to wear a mask because of a mask to stop a virus."
75,3,"I had a mask on as a child and the government told me that it was to help stop the spread of pandemics and that I'm not a pandemic victim but an outbreak. So I said hey, do you have the health insurance?"
75,5,"Well, the point is, people are shit. They're not in the best position to know if they're in the right for a pandemic to happen, but they should be able to make sure it doesn't happen again."
75,6,"Is it a joke? Yes, but people don't like to think about the vaccine as something to be ashamed of."", ""I just do what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."""
75,10,"It's a joke, but the problem isn't the mask, but how does one avoid having a virus or getting one. It's not really a joke."
75,21,"I believe they have the power to fix this, they're the ones sabotaging vaccines."
75,23,I want to share my experiences with the idea that I shouldn't wear a mask if I don't have health insurance. This has to do with the pandemics.
75,24,"I just thought a bit of ""I don't have health insurance,"" because I think I'm the only one."
75,25,I have an epiphany. It's not just a joke.
75,36,"People don't realize that pandemics are not a big deal, so they wear the mask to fight it, as a joke."
75,45,"They want a pandemic epidemic to spread around the world, and that pandemic isn't going to get worse. They want a pandemic epidemic, and that pandemic has no place there."
75,50,They're implying that the pandemic is not a pandemic. It's a joke.
75,52,">When I was younger, I remember wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because I had a cold. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be vaccinated, but I just did what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."""
75,53,Is there a joke that was used in public?
75,57,"In other words, I think it's funny when they say 'The CDC's ban on wearing masks is an insinuation that the government would have to fuck people who are sick for the entire year."
75,59,This is why a party or an emergency is only a few days away. Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But they have to do with pandemics.
75,60,Because I hate pandemics. I'm a pandemic victim and I'm a pandemic victim.
75,72,"People don't have the health insurance to do pandemics because it's not a pandemic. But the government wants to fix the problem, rather than make it a joke."
87,75,"I've always wondered if the gov't just put a lot of emphasis on the gov't's failure to protect children, as if it was a joke."
98,75,"Afraid it sounds like a joke. He's trying to make fun of the joke, because he's a dick. He's a dick."
75,3,"I can't find a real good joke on this one. That doesn't sound very funny, and I think people would be pretty mad if they were to mention the fact that the CDC was banned on a mask if they wanted to be in a situation where a pandemic occurred. That's where they are."
75,5,"I can't even imagine wearing a mask because of a pandemic. It was meant to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke, but it's not like it's a joke."
75,6,"This is not a joke, it is a joke."
75,10,People are in danger for life. You aren't the one doing it and you are the one that was making fun of it.
75,21,"The article states: “I wear a mask to stop the spread of pandemics” [and I’m a dick. I would like to be asked why someone wears a mask during a pandemic because I think that is a joke.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293)"
75,23,A joke is a joke. The way it is said is that people don't have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it.
75,24,The guy I met a couple of years ago was like this. He was talking about how much a virus should be thrown out and how the CDC needs to fuck people if it's not a big deal. He was really oblivious to the fact that the CDC would have to cut down the ban on people wearing masks.
75,25,"I don't like it when people joke about that because it's the opposite of what's common in those other threads. But I do like that people use the phrase ""I have an epiphany"" as it's an expression of what the government is trying to imply."
75,36,">I don't think they have a right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. We have the rights to be concerned about it. This is not a joke, it is a joke."
75,45,"Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But they have to do with pandemics. They want a pandemic epidemic to spread around the world, and that pandemic has no place there."
75,50,"...but I'm not gonna lie, I thought that was a really good joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
75,52,"It seems to me that the whole thing is just a dick joke. It's not about the mask, it's about the idea that people can't afford health insurance. It's not about the problem, it's about the solution to a situation that could have been solved in some way."
75,53,"It's pretty funny. In a lot of cases, people wear masks, as in the health of the disease."
75,57,"I have to say, I'm not a big fan of the joke. But I was pretty unimpressed at one point, when it seemed like that's the case."
75,59,CDC's ban on wearing a mask is an insinuation that the government would have to fuck people who are sick for the entire year. This is why a party or an emergency is only a few days away. Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But they have to do with pandemics. Because I hate pandemics. I'm a pandemic victim and I'm a pandemic victim.
75,60,What a crazy guy! Honestly I'd be mad at him if I didn't have health insurance.
75,72,There's an entire wiki article about a government ban on wearing a mask when a pandemic's coming out.
87,75,I think the AMA is not about the health of the child and not the vaccine. It's about what they can do and not just putting on the mask.
98,75,The joke is that this guy is trying to prevent the spread of a virus from getting into everyone's lives. The problem is that he's just trying to make a joke out of it.
75,3,The reason it is a joke is that people are actually in danger. That's the reason the CDC is banned.
75,5,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask in a pandemic because they'd never actually done it, but there's a reason that they shouldn't have to wear a mask for emergencies."
75,6,"I think the idea of the ""pandemic era"" as a joke and the problem with it, rather than a threat, is a little silly."
75,10,"This is a dick joke. I can't find a real good joke on this one. That doesn't sound very funny, and I think people would be pretty mad if they were to mention the fact that the CDC was banned on a mask if they wanted to be in a situation where a pandemic occurred. That's where they are."
75,21,The entire thing is a joke.
75,23,"[The article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293)"
75,24,"This is the right joke. I feel like the message is clear - just because I think that's a good joke doesn't mean it isn't a joke. I think it would be pretty funny if people did that, but it wouldn't be funny."
75,25,I would love to see an explanation of why this is a joke.
75,36,I can't believe a government ban on a mask is in existence. It would be a joke if it did it would be a joke about the threat of pandemics.
75,45,I would like to be asked why someone wears a mask during a pandemic because I think that is a joke.
75,50,It's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The whole thing is just a joke. I don't think they have the right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. But they have to do with pandemics.
75,52,"It's not about the mask. It's about the health of the person who is infected, whether it's on his or her own. It's about the idea that a person doesn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It's about the idea that people who are infected don't have the right to have health insurance."
75,53,If I were in an emergency situation I'd probably be able to handle the CDC. It's ridiculous he's wearing a mask. I'm a victim and I hate pandemics and he doesn't need a pandemic. I'd feel he needs to be in the emergency room because he's going to be in a pandemic.
75,57,"The first article in this sub, ""The problem is that he's just trying to make a joke out of it."" I've been using it on and off since I read it."
75,59,"AIDS doesn't really have a ""pledge of good for health"" to be a joke, it's about the fact that the government is responsible for the spread of all AIDS."
75,60,"Yeah, the joke is actually a joke. But not really a joke in my opinion. I'm not a doctor, but I know what you mean."
75,72,No. He was just trying to make a joke. He made a joke about the pandemic and they wouldn't let him wear a mask at his own party.
87,75,"The AMA is not about the health of the child, it's about the health of the government."
98,75,", ""As a politician, I am a member of the Communist Party of Iran"""
75,3,"A man who wore a mask during a AIDS pandemic might think it's hilarious, and the whole idea is stupid."
75,5,"Is it true that the anti AIDS propaganda campaign is aimed at the health of the innocents, and not to encourage the public to wear the mask in cases of pandemics?"
75,6,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask in a pandemic because they'd never actually done it, but there's a reason that they shouldn't have to wear a mask for emergencies. The whole thing is just a joke. I think the message is clear - just because I think that's a good joke doesn't mean it isn't a joke. The whole thing is just a joke."
75,10,">I would love to see an explanation of why this is a joke. I think the idea of the ""pandemic era"" as a joke and the problem with it, rather than a threat, is a little silly."
75,21,"I'm not sure if I'd find a joke to be funny. I know that the joke is funny because you've posted on this sub, and it doesn't seem like a joke at all."
75,23,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,24,"I am sorry, but it seems like they have been using the same jokes for years. And yes, it's a joke, I still like the CDC."
75,25,"It sounds like they're trying to imply that people should have no rights to wear a mask. It sounds like the government is a bad idea. And he was trying to make a joke about it, and the CDC is a good joke about it, because he hasn't had any health issues and he's not a doctor, and that's just a joke."
75,36,if the government bans it is a joke
75,45,"And there's no going back, or a joke."
75,50,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask in a pandemic because they'd never actually done it, but there's a reason that they shouldn't have to wear a mask for emergencies."
75,52,I've figured it's a joke in the sense that it is a joke in the way the article talks about pandemics and the government's role in preventing them from spread.
75,53,"I'm so sorry, but I think you're wrong. The entire AMA is not about the health of the child, it's about the health of the government."
75,57,The jokes are made up by politicians.
75,59,A man wears a mask.
75,60,That's a joke!
75,72,"As a politician, I love being told to stop wearing a mask and the government is responsible for a lot of pandemics."
87,75,I'm worried about why the government doesn't push this ridiculous policy. It's funny because it makes more sense to not follow the AMA in this way. I think it's a very positive thing.
98,75,"I know a guy who has been trying to make a joke about this for years, but he can't seem to figure out a joke. I think he might be trying to sway the government."
75,3,Why doesn't the CDC ban you because it helps the health of the child? What does the CDC ban?
75,5,"'Is it true that the anti AIDS propaganda campaign is aimed at the health of the innocents, and not to encourage the public to wear the mask in cases of pandemics?''"
75,6,This is not a joke. This is a joke. This is not a joke. The joke is an effort to make it better for us people and not to be able to make it. I do think you are right that a lot of people in the AMA aren't actually aware that the joke is a joke. If people don't want to wear it they don't want to wear a mask. Unless you know the AMA is about the government and how it is a joke that isn't a joke.
75,10,My friends and I were talking about the dangers of getting sick from pandemics. I was talking about the health hazards of AIDS. I don't see the point.
75,21,"In a similar manner, a politician who was trying to make a joke about what they were attempting to do in their state can't say anything about the actual threat. If someone wore a mask during a AIDS pandemic, that would be a joke."
75,23,"I think it's about as if you are talking about AIDS, not about whether you are aware of the pandemics themselves or not."
75,24,"AIDS is not a joke, it's a threat. It's a threat. The government will not be able to use it."
75,25,AMA is the only place in the world where the CDC and the media have made fun of and discredit any inflammatory message about the AIDS epidemic.
75,36,Yes. People are very receptive to the government's policies.
75,45,"I think that the government would be willing to pay for some basic medical training, but there would still be some semblance of some sort of government policy. This is a really good example of what is actually being done to reduce the number of people who aren't already in the process of dying from an epidemic."
75,50,What the other guy is saying is that the government isn't the one who has made this joke.
75,52,It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem. The whole thing is just a joke.
75,53,You should be able to say that as well.
75,57,I just came from Iran. They have no policy on pandemics.
75,59,"[Sorry, but the AMA is just a joke."
75,60,"You're saying the government is a joke, not a joke?"
75,72,Nope. It's a joke.
87,75,"I think the AMA is about protecting the public. This is called ""invisible immunity"" and can be used as a symptom for a number of diseases."
98,75,Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
75,3,The AMA is one way to get people to go to the CDC and see if anyone can use the joke to do something that actually helps people.
75,5,>This is an effort to make it better for us people and not to be able to make it.
75,6,"Aside from the one guy being right, the AMA is about the government, not the government itself."
75,10,I don't understand how you can argue with this.
75,21,"I grew up in the South, and I'd wear a mask because it was a joke."
75,23,"''The article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293)'', 'The way it is said is that people don't have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it."
75,24,A big part of being a victim is taking a stance about being a victim in the future.
75,25,> The whole thing is just a joke. The whole thing is just a joke.
75,36,It's the AMA. The AMA is not a joke. It's about the government being able to help fight pandemics. It's about protecting the public. It's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic.
75,45,Is this a joke?
75,50,What if people wear a mask at a party?
75,52,AMA is a joke. It's just about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
75,53,"My brother and I were talking about the risk of AIDS and he didn't need the mask, so we went out to a party. Luckily they made the right decision not to wear it because it is a joke and that's what he was referring to. But now he is going to come out with a joke on his face that says, ""I'm a victim and I hate pandemics and he doesn't need a pandemic."" Especially since it sounds like his comment was a joke."
75,57,I thought this was a joke.
75,59,AIDS isn't a joke. AIDS is a threat. It's a joke.
75,60,> I'm not sure how many people are being treated with the word jail in the language of the article. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
75,72,That's a lot of crap that is being made out of the AMA.
87,75,It's a joke.
98,75,"I hate to say it, but I do think it's funny."
75,3,People don't have an AMA to make jokes about.
75,5,"I think this is hilariously clever. My ex would say it was a joke about the fact that the AMA aimed to prevent a pandemic from recurring. My ex would also tell me he was being a liar and tried to give some people the illusion that a pandemic wasn't possible, and he was implying that it was the AMA to do so."
75,6,AMA is about the government not government. That's a joke.
75,10,I think the AMA is a joke about being in a pandemic era.
75,21,Is there a reason the AMA is a joke? It is about the government being able to help fight AIDS.
75,23,"I didn't know you were making this joke because it's a joke, so it doesn't really matter if you're referring to a joke that says you're being a victim."
75,24,The AMA is about the government being able to fight the pandemics and protecting the public. It's about protecting the public.
75,25,"So, why is there a joke being made in AMA?"
75,36,People are also trying to make a joke. They are saying they're not willing to make a joke when it comes to their health. They're arguing that they don't want to make a joke. So they can't make a joke and then put a tad of shit up and be a jerk.
75,45,There is no such thing as a joke. It's more than a joke.
75,50,"I think you're getting to the end of the whole thing, so I think I'll try to make the joke out of it."
75,52,AMA is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
75,53,AIDS is a threat. It's a joke. It's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic.
75,57,"This post, while I can relate to AIDS. This is not a joke."
75,59,"I have been a pandemic victim in the last 10 years, and my brother is the one with AIDS. I am not sick unless I have a mask. I have not had any AIDS or any autoimmune disease. I can't have a pandemic because I don't wear a mask. I don't know what the problem is. I was able to go to a party and he did nothing. I went to the AMA and then he started giving his comments and comments, and then he thought it was a joke. This is not"
75,60,Nope. Not a joke. It's not a joke. A joke. It's not a joke.
75,72,"[NAME] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
87,75,That is the whole point of this thread.

75,6,"I've never seen a joke like this at a party, but I know it is a joke."
75,10,[I think the AMA is a joke. It is about the government being able to help combat a pandemic. People are also trying to make a joke about the fact that the AMA is about the government being able to prevent the spread of a virus. I think the AMA is about the government being able to help fight a pandemic and protecting the public.
75,21,"As a woman who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask in a pandemic, I'd be very upset that you said you would not wear a mask to a party. You could have said you're in the minority of the majority and reacted as if you didn't know what the joke was about."
75,23,"""...I am not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim."""
75,24,I think you guys should start thinking about a lot of different topics.
75,25,I have a very hard time believing there is a joke about the AMA.
75,36,"I don't think you are being funny, is it?"
75,45,This is about a joke about how I would feel if I were alive but don't go to a party that would get infected with AIDS
75,50,I think you could say the same thing. The AMA is a joke and everyone is being a dick. The government is not the one who made it.
75,52,"A good joke is an easy one. If you want to keep a joke, you need to keep trying."
75,53,It's more than a joke. It's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic.
75,57,">[In other words, I think it's funny when they say 'The CDC's ban on wearing masks is an insinuation that the government would have to fuck people who are sick for the entire year."", ""I have to say, I'm not a big fan of the joke."
75,59,There's not a joke. But I'd be interested in hearing some of the other posts.
75,60,">You're saying the government is a joke, not a joke?"
75,72,i’m pretty sure i have a bunch of friends who don’t wear masks when they’re not on their feet and go to the party.

75,3,"The AMA is a joke, I think, but it's also a joke."
75,5,"""People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.''"
75,6,Is the government really making a joke? Are people just laughing?
75,10,"I don't think people are being silly here, but you're right to be mad if you say the joke is a joke. The AMA is about the government being able to help combat a pandemic, but it's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic."
75,21,"I mean that's exactly how a joke works. Apparently it's a joke, but it's not that funny."
75,23,This is funny. You have the right to get sick. And it's a joke. Isn't it?
75,24,"""Pale of straws"" is another common joke that I've encountered at parties. I'm glad there's a joke about this in the post."
75,25,I'm assuming the AMA's title is referring to the fact that people are using it to talk about the pandemic. But the whole thing is a joke and it's just a joke.
75,36,"It's a joke. It's a joke, but it is not a joke. Is it a joke?"
75,45,"I've never heard the term'smokers' like this before, but you sound like an idiot."
75,50,"As a woman who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask in a pandemic, I’m very upset that you say you would not wear a mask to a party."
75,52,It is more than a joke. It is about the idea that people should not have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem. The whole thing is just a joke. It's more than a joke. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.
75,53," 'The entire AMA is not about the health of the child, it's about the health of the government. ''There's a naysayer in there that is not a really good doctor despite how he has dealt with pandemics and it's a huge scam.''"

75,59,"I don't think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's more about the government, not the AMA."
75,60,What exactly is a joke?
75,72,I agree with the other comments. A little bit of the AMA is really just the people who made a joke about the AMA that are gonna make the government take advantage of people who are sick and who aren't going to be able to get infected with AIDS.
87,75,"It seems to me that the AMA is supposed to be a joke about the government not protecting children, a joke about how people don't know if they can't get vaccinated."
98,75,It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
75,3,AMA is about the government. It is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.

75,10,I'm going to go give my best friend a good laugh.
75,21,I'd love to see a piece about this. It's like I had a sex with my husband for a year and a half before the pandemic hit and my sex life sucked.
75,23,It's funny. You have the right to get sick. And it's a joke. Isn't it?
75,24,I'd never get sick of someone wearing a mask. It is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
75,25,"The phrase ""you can't just stop being sick if they aren't at the hospital."" is one of the main points of the AMA that was made, I think."
75,36,if the government bans it it is a joke.

75,60,I don't see what a joke is as such. This is so uncharacteristically depressing to me. I think most people would have to if I didn't know how to say this: 'People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.'
75,72,I think people are right to be mad that this guy is trying to make a joke about the government and not about it.
87,75,"If you want to keep your children safe if your doctors don't vaccinate you, you can take them to the doctor."

75,50,"I'm not sure what I feel about this AMA and what it's about, but the idea that this is about the government. That is the joke."
75,52,I think they spelt the word joke out of the context of their AMA. The article was in response to the general opinion of people. It was not about pandemics and not pandemics.
75,53,The entire AMA is about the government and is about the CDC.
75,57,I don't think we can make that joke.

75,10,"They don't even have to ban a mask and are referring to the AIDS pandemic, rather the CDC being banned."
75,21,The fact that there's actually an AMA about the CDC saying it's a joke is beyond me.
75,23,"It's also a joke if you think people want to help, especially if they don't have AIDS."
75,24,We need people in our lives and we need to keep going.
75,25,I'm in the middle of a pandemic era and I'm gonna put a new mask on so I can't go anywhere and the CDC shits my pants like shit.
75,36,"This is just a joke, and there's no such thing as a joke."
75,45,I don't think there's anything funny or sexist about this. There's nothing real about a joke. And it's a funny idea.
75,50,"ahhhhhhhhh, the joke."
75,52,"If people wear masks, they don't really think it's a joke. They think that it's a joke. Whether they like it or not, it's a joke."
75,53,The entire AMA is about the government. I am just not familiar with how he would act if he was talking about the pandemic and the CDC.
75,57,"You have a point here. If someone tries to cite the CDC's AMA and tells you about it, you will have to go and rethink it for the next AMA."
75,59,They should just leave it alone.
75,60,"So a woman has to wear a mask to fight off a pandemic, and that's a joke."
75,72,"[(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
87,75,AMA is the reason why people are so scared of people and vaccinate their children.
98,75,"If you want to know where the jokes come from, you should look for a subreddit for them."
75,3,I do not think this is the same as having a AMA about a government program.
75,5,There's a lot of stuff that people can't seem to figure out.
75,6,"As a medical student I can say that I am a big fan of the CDC and the government as well as the government. The CDC is a joke and they are trying to make a joke out of it. This is why I don't wear a mask. This is not a joke, because you can't help it. I am so scared of the CDC that I want to help. This is why I keep it up."
75,10,I don't really understand how the AMA is a joke. The AMA is about the government being able to help prevent a pandemic. People are also trying to make a joke about how CDC banned on a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
75,21,"""I would just laugh a little at the fact that I know they can get into my face and that i want to get my feces out of my face and just look at my face."
75,23,">'Ask me if I can't wear my mask. They don't even have to ban a mask and are referring to the AIDS pandemic, rather the CDC being banned."
75,24,"If it is any consolation to me that you are the victim of this and it's a joke, I wouldn't think the CDC would be able to make a better discussion about the problem."
75,25,"""You have an epiphany. It's not just a joke."" ""I would love to see an explanation of why this is just a joke. The whole thing is just a joke."
75,36,AMA is about government being able to help fight the pandemics.
75,45,"Considering that they're only able to prevent a pandemic to spread all over the world, putting on a mask to fight off an epidemic would be a joke. Having a mask for 2 years now has made me very nervous and I feel really sick at home."
75,50,If people are really worried about the vaccines they need to wear a mask to avoid one. Is there a reason they need to put a mask on?
75,52,"If someone tells me it isn't about pandemics, and I'm concerned that something might be wrong with me, I think it is a joke."
75,53,I think they are going to get to the point that a lot of people in the US are afraid of people with AIDS so they just don't take it seriously.
75,57,"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke. AMA is the reason why people are so scared of people and vaccinate their children. If you want to know where the jokes come from, you should look for a subreddit for them."
75,59,"This post doesn't do anything about the government or the pandemic. This is the main reason why people are afraid of people and vaccinate their children. If you want to know where the jokes come from, you should look for a subreddit for them."
75,60,What would make this a joke if it was only one of the four lines of AMAs?
75,72,You might want to check out the AMA on here if you haven't already. It's about the government and pandemics and not about AMA's.
87,75,"I think the AMA is about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus, which despite being a joke, isn't exactly healthy for the baby."
98,75,"I don't want to be the one doing all this. I want to feel that you're not having fun in your post, and your friend seems to be going against your grain."
75,3,"> 'I like to see a great AMA. I want to see if anyone can use the joke to do something that actually helps people.', '"
75,5,"The question is why people are having trouble reading the information. It is a joke. It's about the government's ability to prevent a pandemic. People are scared of people who aren't vaccinated. The government is able to prevent a pandemic. They are making fun of the government, but it's not about them."
75,6,"AMA is a joke. AMA is about the government and causing pandemics. If you want to know where the jokes come from, you should look for a subreddit for them."
75,10,The AMA is about how the government is able to help fight the pandemic. The people who want to do it are the ones that want to be involved.
75,21,"So you're saying, ""I'm not sure if I'd find a joke to be funny. I know that the joke is funny because you've posted on this sub, and it doesn't seem like it's funny at all."","
75,23,People are often talking about a virus that can spread out in the US.
75,24,"I've been in this same situation with my daughter, and I'm not sure what I would do about it. I've always thought the same things are true, and I feel as though they're sexist and stupid. Until now, I don't even get it."
75,25,"> ""I would love to see an explanation of why this is just a joke. The whole thing is just a joke."
75,36,I read an AMA on my phone and this is the main topic I was referring to.
75,45,I think the AMA isn't a joke. A AMA is about the CDC making a joke.
75,50,"I think it's good that this is an AMA about a government program. The AMA has the potential to have a lot of connotations on why people are making jokes about the government. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The whole thing is a joke. I don't think the government has the right to say ""no"" to the AMA."
75,52,It seems to me that the whole thing is just a joke. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem. The whole thing is just a joke.
75,53,The AMA is about government not helping people. That's a joke.
75,57,I'd make a big post on this sub. AMA's. There's no such thing as a joke on this subreddit.
75,59,"AMA is about a joke, not the government's pandemic."
75,60,"AMA [Songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
75,72,"That's just a joke. It's about protecting the public. AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus. If you want to know where the jokes come from, you should look for a subreddit for them."
87,75,"I think the AMA is about protecting the public, but I think the government is trying to change it to save people from a serious health issue. That's not about protecting a child. That's not about preventing disease."
98,75,I wear a mask and you know it's for a joke.
75,3,A lot of people are avoiding it. If people don't understand why they're being abused they're being mistreated. Those are some common points here that the CDC is not really in a position to use.
75,5,I feel like there are a lot of people who make these jokes about the government. You're the one who's pointing out that they're sexist and stupid.
75,6,"Honestly, I like the way you're writing it. I don't want to be like [McDaniel] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood) on a limb, but when I do, it sounds like it's very different to what people would call ""speech"" and ""shock"" on a person who is just thinking about a virus."
75,10,''We wear a mask because we want to prevent people from getting sick from a pandemic ''
75,21,- And then there's the question of why the AMA has the potential to have a lot of connotations on why people are making jokes about the government.
75,23,It's a joke. People don't have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it.
75,24,You should read the subtitles. It is a joke.
75,25,"i've been reading a lot of comments on this subreddit that say ""I'm not sure if it's a joke."""
75,36,You are not allowed to join this subreddit to have a joke about the government.
75,45,"I think you're missing the whole point of ""Support the people that have been suffering in the past, vaccinated. We've got to work on our health!"
75,50,"The AMA is the joke, not the real one. The AMA is a joke, not a joke."
75,52,Is this a joke?
75,53,"I'm assuming the point was that a joke is about the government, not people preventing AIDS? I mean, the fact that he's wearing a mask is more than likely a joke, but a joke about the government causing the pandemic is a joke IMO. That being said, there are no ""jokes"" that are made about the government and not the government."
75,57,"AMA is about how the government is able to prevent a pandemic. People are scared of people and vaccinate their children. If someone tries to cite the CDC's AMA and tells you about it, you will have to go and rethink it for the next AMA."
75,59,"The joke was made mainly because they didn't want to make fun of the people who did. If you're into the topic, try to get it out of your head. That's the kind of joke that's going to get you downvoted."
75,60,"I think a lot of people would have to read the AMA because I think that it's a joke. That's because it's about the government. I'm sure the AMA's are sexist and stupid, but I think it's also because it's a joke, but it's not a joke."
75,72,"So, what does this AMA mean?"
87,75,"The AMA is about prevention, but the government is trying to get people off of vaccines and vaccinations."
98,75,I've never heard of a joke that used a joke as an excuse to avoid an HIV outbreak.
75,3,The problem here is that people are not being forced to get into a joke about the government. They are not allowed to have an AMA about the government.
75,5,This is the last thing I want to do at all if I are going to ask the government not to tell me what to do in a pandemic.
75,6,"I don't want to be like someone who is just being rude, and that AMA was one of the worst comments ever made. I'm not saying people should not have to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, but that doesn't seem to be the case here."
75,10,"""We wear a mask because we want to prevent people from getting sick from a pandemic. People are afraid of people and vaccinate their children."""

75,23,AMA is not about the government.
75,24,"My family is at a party with people in a mask. I have to go home. I have a bunch of family there to vaccinate me but never even a mask for me. They aren't the only people with one, and the only reason they are not vaccinated is to keep people vaccinated."
75,25,"Yes, he's making fun of the CDC because he's being a pandemic victim."
75,36,That's a lot of people!
75,45,"""Hey, what a joke"" is a gimmick."
75,50,"I think I've seen a lot of the comments. There aren't the ""I don't think the government has the right to say ""no"" to this AMA, but I find that a lot of the comments here aren't being sexist and stupid. But when I look at it, I see how it's a joke."
75,52,"""I'm not sure if this is a joke. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem."""
75,53,I don't think it was really a joke. I just know how some people feel. You should be able to see this kind of stuff at school.
75,57,"It is a joke. I don't think it's a joke, IMO."
75,59,You want to know why people are making such a silly joke? You mean it's about the government and the pandemic?
75,60,"""I know, I wouldn't care whether or not this is a joke"", ""I don't think you need to be mad at me if I don't have health insurance."""
75,72,I don't understand what you mean by ''judge''. ''Judge'' is a non-sexist term. I don't understand what your idea of the AMA is but I don't understand how it's a joke. I know I'm in this world and I'm trying to get the most out of it. I don't understand it being a joke about a government in the way of addressing peoples needs. It's a joke to help people and not be the reason why people are being told about.'
87,75,"The government can make fun of it, but I still think it's funny. The government is just trying to get people to do more. They're all in a joke about the government and the public, and their policies aren't about children. They are about protecting the public and protecting the public, and they are trying to take advantage of the public."
98,75,"I wore a mask about 7 years ago, and it was funny. I'm not sure how many people who think this is a joke can understand what it means. I'm sure a few will have heard the joke, but I haven't figured it out. The joke was funny for a while."
75,3,AMA is about government. It is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.

75,21,I don't know why people have such a hard time accepting such an insult. Isn't it ironic that people do these things to avoid a pandemic?...but I don't think a public safety worker needs to do these things.

Is there a joke he's trying to make about the government?"
87,75,The problem is people in AMAs don't have the right to have a discussion about vaccines. People are forced to ignore the facts and use the actual facts as evidence of their failure to do so.
98,75,This joke is hilarious. I don't think the joke is bad either. I don't think it is a joke. You don't fucking need to wear a mask to avoid getting HIV.

75,5,No. A lot of people are making jokes about the government in order to prevent pandemics. People are able to ignore the facts and use the actual facts as evidence of their failure to do so.

75,21,The joke is about people who believe AIDS is real and that people do sexist things to fight the disease.
75,23,CANNOTANSWER'S joke is that we should never be allowed to speak at the party when we've had our own issues. It's a petty joke.

75,60,"In a lot of countries, that is a joke. So, a joke is only about people being able to get vaccinated without a mask."
75,72,You're really weird and that makes you uninformed. People are talking about how you can't feel like it if they're not using the correct phrase. People like this get so incredibly uninformed that they can't really understand what the wording is.
87,75,I'm really not sure why the AMA is going to be anything more than a joke. There's no such thing as a 'funny' thing to tell people when someone says it's funny.
98,75,I think a lot of people are using a mask to try and make fun of people that wore one.

87,75,I have a lot of friends like this and the majority of them don’t even understand the AMA.
98,75,I've been wearing a mask and I thought it was funny.
75,3,"AMAs are usually just a bunch of ad hominem jokes, tbh. AMAs are sometimes about sexism."
75,5,"The joke is about government. If it's about the US or the CDC, it is about preventing the spread of the pandemic."
75,6,"I read the AMA and thought that it was funny, and that the AMA was a joke about people being afraid of AIDS and the government trying to cause the spread of the disease."
75,10,A lot of people are getting into AMAs because they want to be funny. Some are just trying to be funny.
75,21,They've called it a joke because there's a lot of unrelated comments and it's been a while since I've heard of the AMA.
75,23,"I know a lot of people who are attempting to tell the joke that the government isn't doing anything to prevent a pandemic. AMAs are all jokes about the government, not the AIDS epidemic. AMAs are also about the government making fun of it. The AMA is not a joke."
75,24,I've been doing this to my friends for a month. I've gotten to the point where I'm laughing out loud to them. But I don't get it. This is why they're making jokes about the government and the pandemics.
75,25,He's trying to imply that you shouldn't have the right to wear a mask.
75,36,"A lot of people are being sexist and trying to make a joke, which is very difficult. It is extremely unfair to people to be able to say that."
75,45,"People aren't laughing about the AMA, they're laughing about the AMA. I don't see it as a joke either. I'm just saying it's about how it's not a joke and I don't think it's about the government making fun of the AMA."
75,50,">As a person who's a great joker, this whole idea of people making fun of the government is ridiculous."
75,52,"So, it's the AMA, right?"
75,53,"If people were to make a joke about pandemics, they would have a real opportunity to tell the truth."
75,57,Is a pandemic really a joke?
75,59,“People are making fun of the government.”
75,60,I think you may be referring to the AMA where a man is being treated with a mask for a different reason than the person doing it. The AMA was a joke and the AMA was a joke.
75,72,This is a good one. I think it's hilarious that this is a joke.
87,75,"I read the whole article. The AMA is a joke, not a joke."
98,75,This is actually quite interesting. I know the joke was funny when I was in my late 20's.
75,3,It is actually quite funny. I know the joke was hilarious.
75,5,"I think it's good to see the comments on the right side of the AMA, but not the actual AMA."
75,6,i have been on a series of reddit for about a year and it is the reason that the most funny comments come from people who would like to snort a joke about the government.
75,10,The AMA is a joke about the government helping the government deal with pandemics.
75,21,The only reason to get into AMAs is because you know how to avoid being called a dick.
75,23,> I am not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
75,24,I read this post a long time ago. It jumped out at me.
75,25,I can't say that I think he's being sexist. I've had a lot of sex conversations with him.
75,36,That's just what the subreddit is about.
75,45,"I know a lot of people who are attempting to tell the joke that the AMA is about the government, but I think it's about the government making fun of it."
75,50,"""I have no idea why anyone has said I'm upset,"""
75,52,"It seems that you can make a joke, that's what it is."
75,53,"AMA is one of the best jokes I've ever heard. It's really sexist to make fun of people, but I'm more like ""This isn't a joke."" ""People are making fun of the government. AMAs are usually just a bunch of ad hominem jokes, tbh. AMAs are sometimes about sexism."
75,57,"The question is, how do you see it?"
75,59,"There's a lot of good jokes about people, but I'm not sure how many of them are actually real. This is about how many people think of what AMAs are, and what people think."
75,60,"Having read this article and the first part, it seems like this whole thing is about the government. It's a joke that was a joke."
75,72,The AMA is in the main focus of this thread. It was about people being made fun of by their own government for wearing a mask. I'm glad to hear that people are joking about it.
87,75,"I'm an AMA maniac who knows nothing about the politics of vaccination. I don't know anything about the AMA. I'm not trying to jibe about the AMA itself. I'm attempting to understand what the AMA is supposed to be about. I'm not sure what that's actually about, but I'm trying to understand what it's really about."
98,75,I think the best way to prevent the spread of HIV is to avoid it. It's funny that people think it's a joke.
75,3,"People who are actually sick and get sick are not causing anything, and this joke was hilarious."
75,5,CANNOTANSWER is attempting to make a sexist joke about the government.
75,6,"I'm not so sure that any of these comments will make much of a difference in the context of the AMA, especially in this post."
75,10,"If I don't wear a mask and want to be the joke about this AMA, I would, but I would also consider it to be ridiculous, because the AMA is literally the ONLY joke about pandemics."
75,21,"""The only reason to get into AMAs is because you know how to avoid being called a dick."
75,23,Is the government helping to prevent the spread of the virus?
75,24,AMA is actually a lot of jokes about people. I read this article a long time ago.
75,25,""", ""If you are a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim."
75,36,"I've been on many AMAs, countless ad hominem jokes, and a lot of things just as silly as these."
75,45,"I know that the people who fucked up were being very irritated that it was such a joke, but I never felt better. I always thought the AMA was about the government fixing the epidemic. I feel a little bad when I think it's about the government making fun of it."
75,50,"It's funny because, as a man who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask during a pandemic, I'm very upset that you say you would not wear a mask to a party."
75,52,I can't really think of a better reason to be surprised at how funny a joke is.
75,53,"The AMA was written by a woman from Germany, and the AMA was a bitch."
75,57,"I'm not saying the AMA is a joke, but the fact that it's being made up by politicians is more important."
75,59,"""I don't think the mask is a joke. It's a joke, because that's the way it's made fun of the government."""
75,60,"AMA's are usually just a bunch of ad hominem jokes, tbh."
75,72,AMAs are a joke. I mean...
87,75,AMA is a joke. It's about prevention.
98,75,"I have no idea what that means. I have a long history of being sexist, and I have a problem with it."
75,3,I think this is a really fucked up way to tell a story.
75,5,There are many situations that a joke can make a difference. They all sound so similar.
75,6,The reason it was so funny is because people had no idea why it was funny.
75,10,AMAs are a joke about the government. People are making fun of it in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
75,21,"It's like a pandemic victim who gets sick, and feels horrible for the government, but thinks it's funny and doesn't actually care if the government is sabotaging the vaccines. So it's a joke."
75,23,The article is not about the pandemic but the AMA about the government.
75,24,[Kathy slather said 'I'm not a fool for going to a party with people in a mask during a pandemic.'](http://www.advice.org/).
75,25,This hasn't been a joke to me in a long time. I haven't seen the AMA because of this. I can't see what it is about. If it were for him to not say it would have been a joke.
75,36,"AMA : 'People don't realize that pandemics are not a big deal, so they wear a mask to fight it. People who are actually sick and get sick are not causing anything, and this joke was hilarious. CANNOTANSWER is attempting to make a sexist joke about the government."
75,45,"I'm gonna start by telling you: the ""smokers'"" thing is ridiculous."
75,50,CANNOTANSWER: I’ve never heard of this AMA. I was a victim. But you’re right.
75,52,It seems like you have a problem with AMAs because of the sexist notion that the government is making fun of them.
75,53,"It's a joke. It is a joke. People talk about the government in a AMA, but there isn't a single joke about it. It's about it being used by the government for pandemics."
75,57,"I am afraid to say I am not a big fan of the joke, but I am genuinely upset that someone is attempting to make a joke about it."
75,59,It seems like this is a joke made up by a bad guy with a bad habit.
75,60,"> I think a lot of people would have to read the AMA because I think that it's a joke, not a joke. I'm not sure how many people would have to if I didn't know how to say it's a joke."
75,72,"I agree with a lot of people's comments, but I think the whole thing has to have been a lot more about the government. I have had the courage to do something to prevent the spread of a pandemic. I've been on AMA's about preventing the spread of HIV. I think the best way to prevent the spread of a virus is to avoid it. It's funny that people think it's a joke, especially as he explains the implications of wearing a mask when they're not."
87,75,I don't think it's a joke. AMAs are about preventing people from getting sick. AMAs are about preventing people from getting sick.

75,10,"AMA: ""We don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics."""

75,23,"They are promoting health literacy, and to show you that they are all about health care for the people of the US. The joke's about making fun of people who want to stop it."
75,24,CANNOTANSWER:
75,25,"I think the government's intention is to not prevent any of this from happening. They are trying to try and cause more problems, such as the spread of viruses, so people are becoming better at managing their own health."
75,36,">We are making a joke about the government, but there is no such thing as a joke"
75,45,I thought it was a joke. I think it was a sexist joke.
75,50,It's a joke that the government isn't the one who is making fun of.
75,52,You have no idea what is going on.
75,53,"The joke is making fun of him because it's a joke about him making fun of the government and the CDC because it's a joke about the government. This isn't about the pandemics, but it's about the government being able to prevent the spread of a disease."

75,59,A man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's a joke. It is about the government and pandemics.
75,60,I think '[NAME] is a very good person.'
75,72,"I'm a huge fan of this joke, because I don't think people will believe it."
87,75,"This is the most eloquent discussion in my life, so if you want to understand what's a joke, you'll want to. I've been there, done that, done that, and now, you're just wondering about the topic of AMAs. What I can see in it is some of the comments, but to me it's just a joke, not an actual AMA."
98,75,I'm also curious to know who the joker is.
75,3,"I can't tell you what to say. ""I don't like AMA's, but I think that is kind of what the AMA is about."""
75,5,"People have a reason not to wear a mask, it's more about the government. It's a joke."
75,6,"There's a lot of jokes about the government, I don't think that it's a joke or about a joke, but it's also not an actual joke, a joke about the government."
75,10,I don't think it's a joke that the AMA is about the government helping the government deal with pandemics.
75,21,What is this AMA about? The CDC and the people who made it so ridiculous?
75,23,"CANNOTANSWER: I think the government's intention is to not prevent any of this from happening. They are trying to cause more problems, such as the spread of viruses."
75,24,I'm a large fan of AMA's and AMA's.
75,25,That is a great joke!
75,36,"This is a joke. It is about the government being able to fight pandemics, which is a joke."
75,45,"I mean, you don't want to know about the government or their plans or anything. The AMA, aka the one about people getting sick, was a pretty good example."
75,50,People have never heard of 'AMA's where there's a joke about the government being trying to stop a pandemic and they want to see people do something about it?
75,52,That's a terrible way to talk about the AMA.
75,53,"I don't know what the AMA is about. I want to know it's about the government and pandemics. I would say something like ""We don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.""."

75,72,"IANAL, but it's my favorite AMA."
87,75,AMAs are about protecting the public and prevention of diseases. But a number of things have happened in the past:
98,75,You haven’t talked to the joker in a long time.
75,3,"This AMA is all about the government, not the government itself. The AMA is about the government. It is about the government's intention to help prevent pandemics."
75,5,>'s also that the article says AMA is about the government's ability to prevent a pandemic.
75,6,"I thought it was funny because it was funny that there were people who were making a joke about the government, not about the virus itself."

75,24,What AMA is this about?
75,25,It seems like he was talking about how we should fight the pandemics.
75,36,"The term ""AMA"" is a little different from ""Ad hominem joke""."
75,45,AMA is about the government making fun of the government. I don't know why people are being so reprehensible about how it's an AMA.
75,50,"I think it's a joke, a joke, a joke. It's a joke, a joke, a joke, a joke."
75,52,CANNOTANSWER:
75,53,The jokes about pandemics are generally about the government.
75,57,This guy is a twat. I'm so upset.

98,75,"I hate people, but I don't see why they don't do that. I've seen a lot of things that people don't realize are just jokes."
75,3,"This is not a joke, it is a joke."
75,5,"I have no idea if there is any truth to the AMA that says that a mask is a joke or not, so the joke makes no sense."
75,6,"As a person who was vaccinated for AIDS, I can say that that ""Jaw is about the government."""

75,21,"The AMA is a joke, not an actual joke."
75,23,"""I think the government's intention is to not prevent any of this from happening."
75,24,The AMA is about protecting the public and helping to prevent the spread of AIDS.
75,25,"I've been reading a lot of comments on this subreddit that say ""I'm not sure if it's a joke."""
75,36,''If the government bans it it is a joke.
75,45,"I'd say that the joke about a person being nervous during a pandemic is a joke. But I know what I like best about it. If you've ever heard someone say something like, ""I'm gonna have to go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic.'"", ""I don't know if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. I think this is a joke because you're a joke about the government."
75,50,"I think he's taking a joke from the one AMA, a joke that it has a funny and hilarious quota. That's something he's probably really ashamed of. I'm not saying that he's trying to make fun of the government, but he's not saying that he's making fun of it. I think he's being a little off-putting. I don't understand why people are making fun of the government because of it."
75,52,The people that have said these things about the government's actions are able to convince themselves that they are a joke.
75,53,I'm the one who actually figured out how to tell the truth.
75,57,I'm not a big fan of AMA.
75,59,"A man with AIDS who doesn't wear a mask is not a pandemic victim. A man with AIDS, who isn't sick, isn't sick because he doesn't wear a mask. I'd say it's a bit unfair that he is getting offended because people say ""I think the government isn't going to help prevent this""."
75,60,"It's not a joke, but the government is helping fight pandemics. That is a joke, and it's about the government."
75,72,"The entire AMA series is a bunch of random comments, I am not sure what they really mean. The AMA is about the government and pandemics. And the AMAs tend to be about the government helping the pandemics. I think it's funny that people think it's a joke."
87,75,I don’t know what it is about but what it means is it’s about protecting the public.
98,75,i like a mask for every day life i am not a christian. Its a joke for all times i do that
75,3,"I'm going to have to take this on a more personal note, a lot of the comments were so ridiculously witty about that AMA they even got downvoted."
75,5,"No one is making any sense with a joke about the government, especially not about pandemics."

75,36,What's the purpose of this AMA?
75,45,There are many reasons for it.
75,50,What makes this joke so great?
75,52,The article AMA is not about pandemics. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
75,53,"I was just a few minutes into the AMA and I thought, ""What did a good doctor do that could stop a pandemic? That's a joke."" Then I started looking up the headlines. So, when I got here, I thought, ""What's a joke about preventing a pandemic?"" I thought, ""Ah yes, it's a joke. I'll take that a mile."" Then I said, ""What is the joke about preventing a pandemic?"", ""There's a joke about"
75,57,"I don't think AMA is a joke. It is about the government's actions. It's about the government helping prevent pandemics. The entire AMA series is a bunch of random comments, I'm not sure what they really mean."
75,59,I read your first sentence in an old dictionary. It explains you're confused.
75,60,"AMAs are very short. Some people like to say ""I don't understand how people want to be offended by a joke. I think it's funny that people think it's a joke, but it's a joke."""
75,72,"In the article it mentions that AMA's are supposed to be about the government, not the government's actions. So in the future the AMA would be about how to prevent AIDS, not the government's actions."
87,75,AMAs are not about protecting people.
98,75,Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
75,3,"It doesn't matter what AMA, because a lot of people do."
75,5,The AMA in the US is more about preventing pandemics than preventing pandemics.

75,21,It's not a joke. AMAs are about the government helping the spread of a virus. It's about how the government is able to prevent a pandemic.

75,10,"There's also a few cases where the joke was the AMA, and some people were implying that the AMA was about the CDC helping to prevent a pandemic."
75,21,There's been a lot of AMAs that are more about people making fun of the government or about the CDC. I don't know about many that are more about people making fun of the government than about AIDS.

75,45,I've been doing the AMA for almost two years and this was the first time I heard this.
75,50,... because when I read this AMA it makes me think of a bunch of other people in the community.
75,52,It's not just a joke.
75,53,I would bet there's plenty of other comments in this sub.
75,57,AMA is not a joke. It's an attempt to make fun of the government.
75,59,I think this is a great place to post that question. This is why we are putting so much focus on the government and vaccinate and prevent pandemics and preventing people from getting sick.

75,5,"My family member and I were discussing the topic of pandemics at our party. When we were at the party, we were always a little scared, so we wore a mask. They would say, ""I don't want to get sick from a pandemic, but if I wore a mask, I don't think I can get sick from a pandemic."" When I was at the party, a woman's face turned red when she said ""My husband said we were going to go to the AMA, and a small 'I don"
75,6,"Yes, AMA is about the government not government"
75,10,">''People aren't in danger for life. You aren't the one doing it and you are the one that was making fun of this.""'', ""[I don't know how you can argue with this](http://www.cdc.gov/fwd/dsc/dsc/dscd/epi_epi_sci-dfsc/)(http://www.cdc.org/fwd/dscd/epi_scd/."
75,21,AMAs aren't about the government. They're about a shit pandemic.
75,23,I have been a bit of a narcissist on the subject for a few years. I don't think the government is making a joke.
75,24,"AMA is a way to get people talking about a problem that is not that bad. It's not about the government or the pandemic, but about the CDC and its efforts to stop it."
75,25,"A ""Joke"" is a joke about the government, not you."
75,36,The phrase AMA is about the government being able to prevent pandemics. The AMA is about stopping the spread of AIDS.
75,45,"""Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic."""
75,50,"Then, at a time when people are being so vocal about their fucking health, you have to be pretty confident."
75,52,"""But what he's saying is just a joke. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem."""
75,53,"I don't get it, but I believe most of the comments on here are just about the AMA. AMAs are all about the government. They're AMAs that are about the government and people making fun of the government."
75,57,AMAs are actually about the government.
75,59,> I don't think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's about the government not the pandemics.
75,60,"AMAs are about the government, not the people."
75,72,"[David Seinfeld, [David Seinfeld, [George Walcott, [NAME]]: ""Hi, AMA. The AMA is a joke."
87,75,"AMAs have very specific purposes. The headline is a joke that does not mean a ""joke"" to some people, and it also has ""jokes"" about the government. What it's about is protecting the public, not the government bringing it up."
98,75,"I'd be happy to be the joker, but not the CDC."
75,3,i think the government should be allowed to have a better understanding of what the AMA is about. i think there is a difference between not having a good AMA about the CDC and not being able to find a joke about the CDC and not having an AMA about it
75,5,"Then, at a time when people are being so vocal about their fucking health, you have to be pretty confident."
75,6,I know a lot of people here that say it is funny but it's not a joke.
75,10,"A joke, I think, and what I'd do is explain the situation by saying that the entire purpose of AMAs is to prevent the spread of a pandemic."
75,21,"I'm sorry, but i'm not talking about AMAs."
75,23,That is a good joke.
75,24,"""I do have a right to be vaccinated but I do not think I can get sick of anybody who wore a mask. But I do not think that is a good joke,"" ""I don't think this is a joke. It is a joke about the government, not you."" ""Don't wear a mask during a pandemic."" ""Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic."" ""If you want to go, I can help you."
75,25,"So, here is what people say about the AMA:"
75,36,"I am talking about the term, AMA, as in ""HIMMER SHOULD NOT COMMUNITY"" versus ""AMA."""
75,45,"AMA is about the government, not the pandemics."
75,50,"I read this. It was a joke. A joke about the government, but a joke about pandemics. The government is not the one who makes fun of it. I think I'm right."
75,52,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics."","
75,53,It's not the government's job to prevent AIDS. They aren't talking about preventing HIV.
75,57,"There is no such thing as a joke. A AMA is a joke about the government, which is in itself a joke."
75,59,"He said he was only aware of the AMA because of a phobia and was a pandemic victim. Then he commented that there is a real possibility the AMA is an AMA, which is what he is being called."
75,60,AMAs are about the government. People want to get treated with a mask but can't afford it. There's no joke in that title.
75,72,"""The AMA is a joke. The AMA is a joke about the government, not the pandemics."""
87,75,No one is going to be able to understand AMAs.
98,75,"I wore a mask to the CDC to get the AIDS to my face. My partner and I had a hysterical reaction to wearing a mask while I slept. So that's the joke I'm going to put on the front page to get the AIDS off my face. I've figured out how to make fun of the joke. I have a phobia of HIV, and I cried the whole time. But it was an excuse for me to wear a mask, as I was thinking it could be fun if my wife and her husband thought"
75,3,AMA is a joke about the government and not a joke about the government. It is about the government's intention to prevent pandemics.
75,5,"I think a'relationship' would fit the bill, and the AMA is the way to go."
75,6,">the AMA is about the government,"
75,10,The AMA is a joke.
75,21,> The whole thing is a joke.
75,23,"In the words of an AMA, it is a joke about a government. People don't have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it. It's a joke about the government."
75,24,The people who made the AMA are overreacting.
75,25,I'm a pandemic victim and I have the same phobia as you. And I still have no idea if this is a joke or a joke or a joke.
75,36,What does the AMA even say?
75,45,I haven't seen any AMAs in two years. I've read all of the one-time AMAs. They're hilarious. I'll make sure that everyone gets the same treatment. EDIT: *A bit of an oversight.*
75,50,"I want to say, ""My husband doesn't have a mask he can't get sick of because he has a pandemic."""
75,52,I can't think of a better reason to be surprised at how funny.
75,53,Why aren't there any comments on here about the government?
75,57,", ""It's a joke. It is a joke about the government."
75,59,"[Did you ever read the first one? It's about the government, not the pandemics]."
75,60,I think it's a joke. But it's not a joke. The government is not the one who makes fun of the joke.
75,72,The AMA was just about people being made fun of by their own government.
87,75,"The AMA is an attempt to protect children, and not about the government."
98,75,"Typically, people who wear masks are being able to accept that sexist jokes are not being able to accept that sexist jokes are not funny. The fact that sexism is being viewed as a problem isn't funny."
75,3,">People who are actually sick and get sick are not causing anything, and this joke is funny."
75,5,So the first time I wore a mask was after a fight with a bbc producer and some other friend.
75,6,I have to agree with the comments you are referring to:
75,10,I'd never like to have to go in sick if it wasn't for the fact that my parents had no insurance.
75,21,"OP is in the US, he grew up in South Carolina, and I am not a fan of the government. I grew up in the US. I grew up in a country where the president of South Carolina is a republican and the president of the United States is a republican."
75,23,"The AMA is a joke, but they're not the people who are making fun of it."
75,24,The AMA is the only way to stop the outbreaks.
75,25,This is a joke. This is a joke. This is not a joke. It is an attempt to protect children. It is not a joke. This is a joke.
75,36,"I'd go with ""Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic"""
75,45,"The post is going to end with ""The AMA is not a joke. It is a joke. In fact, the AMA is a joke. It is a joke about the government."
75,50,Those are all jokes.
75,52,"I am a nurse, so I can say: AMA is a joke, but it is a joke."
75,53,"It doesn't even come close to being a joke. It's an attempt to prevent a pandemic, but it's also about trying to stop a pandemic with vaccines."
75,57,CANNOTANSWER: AMA is about how the US government is able to prevent a pandemic. People are scared of people and vaccinate their children. There is a joke.
75,59,"Because it's a joke about the government, and it's not a joke."
75,60,I can relate to some of these comments.
75,72,"AMA is a joke, but the actual language of the AMA isn't that funny."
87,75,What is the purpose of AMAs? The whole thing is about protecting the public and preventing vaccines.
98,75,The CDC has no problem with a joke about how everyone wears a mask because it helps prevent the spread of AIDS and how people can't wear masks to prevent a virus.
75,3,I'm the guy who does the AMA on a national television show on AIDS. I just think it's an attempt to get people to go to the CDC and try to make a good joke about it.
75,5,So they're not trying to be funny?
75,6,"I can say a lot of people are just laughing and making jokes about the government, but the way you think about it is kind of out of line."
75,10,"People are sexist. It's not like they haven't experienced the symptoms, but just aren't going to change."
75,21,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. A joke isn't a joke. A joke is a joke."
75,23,Is the AMA a joke? I'm not sure about yours but the AMA is not a joke. The joke is about the government helping to prevent the spread of HIV.
75,24,"The AMA isn't a joke, it's about preventing the pandemic and preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
75,25,"I don't know what the whole AMA is about, I've viewed that as a joke in my head for years."
75,36,"This is a joke. The AMA is a joke. That is a joke. It is about preventing the spread of pandemics. It is about preventing the spread of pandemics. This is a joke, but the actual language of the AMA isn't that funny."
75,45,It's called AMA.
75,50,I'm referring to an AMA about the government. I don't think that is a good joke. It is a joke. It's not just a joke. It's a joke. The government is not the one who made it.
75,52,Why is everyone so concerned about pandemics?
75,53,I don't think the AMA is about a pandemic - or it is about the spread of pandemics - but it is a joke.
75,57,A major pandemic is not a pandemic. People are scared of people and vaccinate their children. There is a joke.
75,59,AMAs are a great way to stop AIDS/pandemics. I have never even heard them before.
75,60,"""Why is this joke about the government?"
75,72,There are many good AMA's on Reddit. I'm not a huge fan of the whole thing but you get a lot of bad jokes about the government being a joke about pandemics and that's just plain stupid.
87,75,I can’t even get around to reading the title...
98,75,I would also like to say that this is a joke and that people are trying to delegitimize people who wear a mask.
75,3,"The fact that you say ""Hold your hat, we'll talk about pandemics and tell you, and you can do something about it. "" is actually a joke."
75,5,"The fact that the government is a joke, but not a joke, that this is a joke, is what it is called. It is a joke."
75,6,Is the government really making a joke about the government?
75,10,"It isn't a joke. The AMA is a joke, and it's a joke. A joke about pandemics is just a joke."
75,21,"If they really think they have the power to fix it, they will start to say they don't want to do the things a person thinks are funny."
75,23,"In an AMA, a CDC volunteer says ""if we do something stupid and we're sick, we're going to get sick""."
75,24,It is a joke. The AMA is about preventative action preventing the spread of AIDS.
75,25,I have a phobia of wearing a mask.
75,36,"I think the joke has been made about the AMA, and the person doing it on the subreddit is not the one who made it."
75,45,"In a way, it's like a joke because the government is not trying to delegitimize people who wear a mask for AIDS/AIDS. 'Making fun' is like making fun of a joke about a government being the one who makes fun of it."
75,50,A lot of people are making jokes about the government.
75,52,It's a joke. The joke is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
75,53,I'm not really a big fan of the government but I love the government. But I think there's a whole subreddit on the internet about AMA's.
75,57,"This sub is in the US, we have to work out how to handle the whole pandemic and pandemic pandemic thing. The jokes on the front page of Reddit don't matter at all. They matter."
75,59,It's a joke.
75,60,"That's not how you'd describe AMAs. They're about protecting the public, but the government isn't. And AMAs are very short."
75,72,I like the article. In the end I feel like the joke was more about AIDS.
87,75,AMAs are about the protection of children and not the government.
98,75,I hate to say that. But I do like to say that. I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows if I can get AIDS from that. And yes it does help prevent the spread of AIDS and how it can be prevented by a mask.
75,3,The AMA is actually a joke and not about the government.
75,5,"""There are many situations that a joke can make a difference. They all sound so similar."""
75,6,I love how your AMA was just a joke. I liked how you said it is a joke.
75,10,This post has a nice and short title.
75,21,"I think AMAs are a way to get in and out of sexism. If that is what you want to hear, you can get to the next one."
75,23,What is that AMA about?
75,24,Yes it is a joke. There isn't any reason you would do it unless you got an AMA. You can't be in this conversation without hearing sexist jokes. You are not supposed to be the victim of a AIDS pandemic.
75,25,"I think there's a difference between a ""commentary"" about the AMA and ""your opinion on a joke"""
75,36,"It's called an AMA, not a joke. It's a satire."
75,45,"I do a lot of things pertaining to vaccines. I would like to know why I wore a mask during the pandemic AMA, but I haven't heard any AMAs about AIDS, or any such medically necessary health related stuff. It's not a joke and I think it's a joke about the government, but a joke about how they aren't allowed to do it until it spreads."
75,50,You have a hunch that I'm getting to the end of your story. What is the most valuable part?
75,52,I am not really a fan of government.
75,53,"There is no such thing as a ""joke"" if there isn't one that is supposed to be a joke. It's not about ""foolishness."" It's a ""joke"" if it's not something you want to say but is something you'd like to share in an AMA."
75,57,"You're an idiot. I was a little angry because I never said anything else about the joke, because I'm more like you. I feel bad now. I have to go on my day without speaking."
75,59,It was one of the most offensive jokes I have ever seen on here. What was the story about?
75,60,"[no relation to the AMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
75,72,I think it is funny because the article isn't describing the actual meaning of 'a joke'.
87,75,Its all a joke. Its a joke.
98,75,"I love the title of this thread, and I agree with you that the CDC is making a lot of sexist jokes and jokes, but I don't know how to make fun of them, and I don't think there's much to know about the validity of them. It's just a joke."
75,3,Are you going to go to an AMA with someone who isn't a fan of the government?
75,5,"The AMA was designed to promote awareness and awareness of the pandemics. You can read the AMA title, but not the article."
75,6,"""I'm not gonna believe in government if I have no AIDS. This is not a joke.... But I do think a lot of people in this sub aren't actually aware that the joke is a joke."""
75,10,What I see as a joke is that this is what it is called. People are making fun of it because the word it is about it is a joke.
75,21,AMAs are about people making fun of the government.
75,23,I want to thank you for making that one in the first place.
75,24,I don't think that the AMA is a joke.
75,25,"I mean, I wouldn't even call the whole thing ""a joke"" because I'm more in the middle of pandemics than I am in the middle of. I mean, like it's pretty clear that all these things are a joke, and they can be construed as racist, sexist, and insulting. And I'm not sure if that is true or not."
75,36,"I'm not saying it's a joke, but I think you're right, there is a difference between a AMA and a joke. I just like your username."
75,45,"My friends were vaccinated because of an outbreak of AIDS, and they were also infected with a virus. It was a joke and the fact that it is a joke makes me feel like I was being silly. I don't think it's a joke because I didn't go to that party or because I didn't know what to say."
75,50,"CANNOTANSWER: As a person who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask during a pandemic, I'm very upset that you say you would not wear a mask to a party."
75,52,AMA is more than a joke.
75,53,I think the biggest part of the AMA was that he was going to put on a mask and the AMA was not about AIDS.
75,57,AMAs are a way to get in and out of sexism. What's the point of AMAs?
75,59,The people who made the joke do not have the right to take the joke seriously.
75,60,"No jokes about the government. But the government isn't getting the public the health care they need, so it's a joke."
75,72,The first one on here is about a joke.
87,75,I can't even remember where the article is.
98,75,"""I think I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows."""
75,3,A lot of people who have a diagnosis for AIDS say the same things:
75,5,The AMA is a good way to take the lead on how it is designed to promote awareness and awareness of the pandemics. The whole AMA is about trying to prevent and stop the spread of a pandemic.
75,6,"I know the joke is about the government, I know the jokes about it aren't a joke, but the joke is just a joke."
75,10,"If the AMA is about preventing the spread of a pandemic, then you are making fun of it."
75,21,"""Don't wear a mask because I don't have a mask, because I don't want to have one, and don't want to have it."""
75,23,"I think if people have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it, this isn't a joke."
75,24,I think the AMA is the joke. It was about promoting awareness and awareness of the pandemics.
75,25,So... this is a joke about being a pandemic victim.
75,36,"So you are saying ""I want to see a tad of shit up and be a jerk."""
75,45,"AMAs are for people who are already experiencing a pandemic. The article claims that it is about preventing an epidemic and that the government has to work on the pandemics. The AMA is in fact about the government, so if they don't work on the pandemics the public doesn't need to understand it at all."
75,50,"""People with a severe rash are wearing a mask during a pandemic, and they need a mask that catches them off guard."""
75,52,AMA is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
75,53,It's a joke about a joke. People are making fun of them - they're not even about the government.
75,57,People who want to be vaccinated are in the minority in this sub.
75,59,"I'm assuming you want to look up the AMA. I'm not sure where to start but in terms of the topic, I'm very familiar with the AMA. I just really enjoyed reading this article, which I'm sure is a lot more relevant."
75,60,"> ""I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows."""
75,72,AMA: I’m sorry.
87,75,> I think it's funny because it makes more sense to not follow the AMA in this way.
98,75,"I think wearing a mask is more of a precaution that a sexist joke, like a mask to help people prevent a virus, which can only be made up with an sexist joke."
