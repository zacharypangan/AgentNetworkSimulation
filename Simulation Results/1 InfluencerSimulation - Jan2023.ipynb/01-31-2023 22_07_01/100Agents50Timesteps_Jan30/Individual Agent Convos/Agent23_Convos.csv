23,5,I'm pretty sure I've heard about the importance of vaccinating children.
23,8,That's a good idea!
23,10,I believe that he was being a bit of a jerk for posting this but this doesn't sound like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask at parties. It would be cool to see you around a random group of people in the orlando area.
23,14,It will be cool to see some things you don't like like wearing a mask in public.
23,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
23,16,Do you have a family you could meet with and spend time with?

34,23,I don't have a job i wear a mask to work with people who are in danger for life. I know one person who was just getting infected and she ended up in the hospital.
44,23,That's what the wiki says. They're trying to prevent spread of the virus and the wear masks as a last resort.
47,23,"There is a large number of states and states requiring you to wear a mask to protect yourself and others in the public health field, not just from the government. The laws are for a wide variety of reasons."
54,23,I am pretty sure the government has been working with the government to stop the spread of the disease.

57,23,I would rather have someone take a hand with me to get a med for the sick vs someone who can just take off a mask.
63,23,"i would like to wear a mask at my office for all the work they do, like wearing a face mask at work or work."
75,23,Do you think people who are vaccinated shouldn't wear a mask? Because it could be just as dangerous as you'd think.
79,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,23,This is a great story. It goes like this: We must get the wife a test for HIV.
86,23,"I had a similar question: ""When would you wear a mask to keep a sick person safe?"""
97,23,My neighbor and I went into the grocery store that morning and the only person we talked to came from the other side. It was a bit of a weird place.
23,4,"You're supposed to wear a mask to protect yourself and others in the public health field, not just from the government. The laws are for a wide variety of reasons. Do you think people who are vaccinated shouldn't wear a mask? Because it could be just as dangerous as you'd think."
23,5,"This is so true, and so scary. It makes me think it is the only reason that people wear a mask."
23,8,"If you haven't been vaccinated, you have a chance to die, but you aren't at a risk of getting a vaccine. If not, you should just wear a mask!"
23,10,I want to go to some people I have a great deal of respect for and I would rather wear a mask than the one I've been seeing.
23,14,"The only time that I would wear a mask was during an interview with my mom, who says ""I'd prefer to be alone than in the hospital, where I just want to get me to go. I've never been to a hospital, or had to do anything to help them. I need help, a personal med, and I will be right there in front of the doctor!"" The question was: what did she expect? She'd like to know. You might be able to go to a doctor with a doctor."

They're trying to prevent spread of the virus and the wear masks as a last resort.
23,16,"I see a lot of people who wear a mask at parties, but don't know much about the health consequences besides that, and it's really important that people know that if the child is sick that it's time to get vaccinated. There are ways to save the family."
23,18,Do you have a family you could meet with and spend time with? Is that what you did before the pandemic?
23,21,"You know, this is the kind of thing that we're told is always the best thing to do. Vaccines and meds are not the only things that may help in recovery."
28,23,"I wore my mask during a narco-spray test. It got me from a hospital and thankfully the doctors told me how it could be vaccinated and I could get a vaccine and I was okay. They said I wore my mask to protect and I was able to get vaccinated so that I didn't have to worry about getting the virus. It was so sick and i wasn't feeling well, but I was worried about the fact that it could be spread by another person's stomach and throat. I don't know much about"
34,23,"Aside from a ''Mad Hat''' message in the video, I think it's a good idea to make some more explicit reference to what you're saying."
44,23,I was never going to wear a mask in public. I was more concerned about my health. I didn't want to have to walk.
47,23,If you’re a doctor you’re not getting a treatment for a virus. You want a mask. You don’t have a problem with your health.
54,23,Why are you telling this to me? There’s more to the story than just the person wearing the mask.
55,23,I have no idea what this is about. I have seen lots of other people who have not had a sneezed or shaved face and are terrified of them.
57,23,"You should be ashamed of yourself and you deserve better and better. You deserve better, too."
63,23,> That would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of HealthcareHeroes Wearamask.
75,23,"I think he is trying to imply that a pandemic is not a pandemic, and not that it isn't a pandemic."
79,23,"The first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is."
84,23,They ain't even here. The public should be concerned.
86,23,"""I have a feeling that if they use a mask they'll get a good deal off you."""
97,23,">Oh hey, you are a free gent. i am not just kidding :) Taking a mask off as i just walk around with a bare lip is a bad idea."
23,4,I am more confused than it sounds.
23,5,"Yes, there's an issue of the use of a mask."
23,8,He is being a jerk. And this is very strange.
23,10,"He was being a little mean by the fact that he didn't even make fun of himself. His mom isn't going to have to be in a lot of trouble, so there's that."
23,14,There are many people out there that haven't been vaccinated.
23,15,"As I understand it, people need to be aware that ""what is a last resort"" to prevent the spread of a pandemic is the correct term."
23,16,"Vaccines and meds are not the only things that may help in recovery. If you haven't been vaccinated, you have a chance to die, but you aren't at a risk of getting a vaccine. If not, you should just wear a mask! I want to go to some people I have a great deal of respect for and I would rather wear a mask than the one I've been seeing. The only time that I would wear a mask was during an interview with my mom, who says ""I'd prefer to be alone"
23,18,"Yes, you have a family. There's a reason why you want to go to a doctor and see him. They don't enlighten you about the risks of getting vaccinated and the risks of getting a vaccine. It's not an easy thing to get vaccinated. Vaccines and meds are not the only things that may help in recovery. If you can't get vaccinated, you need to find a doctor with a doctor. You don't need a mask. It's not a great way"
23,21,>I think that he was being a bit of a jerk for posting this but this doesn't sound like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask at parties.
28,23,...I am not the type of person who will stop a pandemic on a vaccinator.
34,23,"They are saying the ""masked pigeon"" is a mask that doesn't cover the virus, so they're asking if it's a mask that stops it from spreading."
44,23,"I feel like you're implying that the US's AIDS epidemic doesn't exist as it is now, but that the state does. You don't need a mask, you need to go. You're on your own. It's a thing, you know?"
47,23,What does the law say about having a mask?
54,23,There's more to the story than just the person wearing the mask.
55,23,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they will take them on."
57,23,">The fact that you are not in the US shows a lot of potential danger here. I'm sorry Mark,"
63,23,"I'm gonna go ahead and say ""Hiuge covid fail to have Santa not wearing a mask during the holidays.Having the correct mask to remove santa during the holidays, would have been a powerful endorsement of HealthcareHeroes Wearamask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Having the correct mask to remove santa during the holidays, would have been a powerful endorsement of HealthcareHeroes Wearamask. I'm still wearing my mask."
75,23,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
79,23,"Why is it important to stop putting the masks on, even if you're doing it with one hand? This is no joke, unless you're in a country where this isn't really a thing. I've heard that ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
84,23,I agree with the jokes:
86,23,"When I was at school, we used to wear a mask as a mask. It was just a temporary thing that we did on our way to school to teach kids. It's more a kind of mask than a helmet."
97,23,I'm going to give you a ring today! I am so glad we all have a place to look to for some kind of a mask.
23,4,I think it is also dangerous that the man was still alive and still had a family of his own.
23,5,"I was gonna say something along the lines of ""I'm not the type of person who will stop a pandemic on a vaccinator."" That wasn't a joke, but ""I'm still wearing my mask."""
23,8,"You might need a ""Path Vaccine"" mask, and a patch."
23,10,"I don't have a great deal of respect for people who wear a mask at parties, but when they do I wear them."
23,14,Is it a secret? Can you come over and get a piece of advice from an AIDS expert to stop the spread of the virus?
23,15,That's exactly why I like to wear a mask when I'm not in the USA.
23,16,I am going to wear this in the holidays because I have a sick child.
23,18,I feel like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask at parties....I'm not the type of person who will stop a pandemic on a vaccinator.
23,21,What does the law say about having a mask? The fact that you are not in the US shows a lot of potential danger here.
28,23,>i'm sorry mark but I don't trust the vaccine
34,23,I'd rather know that the masks at the airport are a joke.
44,23,>He's a great artist. He is a woman. He can play with you in the public spaces. He can do the work for you in the private spaces. I'm sorry to hear about your vaccinated. I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this. Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
47,23,What would happen if a public health specialist in the state was told not to wear a mask because a medical professional didn't want to get hit by a virus?
54,23,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
55,23,"I want to see the first season of season 2, just so I can figure out what a lot of people will say."
57,23,"I'm not sure whether I can actually get my fingers purged on, but on a very rare occasion my doctor asked me whether the first step was to get some antibiotics to stop my stomach from spreading a virus?"
63,23,There is no real purpose to this movie.
75,23,You don't... because people who don't need it don't think they can stop it. They want to help with it and they want to help it. It's not a pandemic.
79,23,We need a change in our healthcare system in the United States.
84,23,"You guys are being naive, because you seem naive, and you are being the kind of person who thinks shit is funny and stupid. It's the same thing for me."
86,23,"I've been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind. It was only a temporary thing, just like any other sort of protective gear. It's probably not for everyone, but it's not something that's in the realm of possibility in a lot of places."
97,23,That's how I look at it.
23,4,I'm so sorry this happened to you.
23,5,I was vaccinated for a few months when I had a TB and had been vaccinated. It was the first time in a decade that I had seen that joke.
23,8,"I'm a child so I want to make sure that everyone knows I don't need a mask, but that you don't just get a patch and just have to make sure everyone knows I don't have a mask."
23,10,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You might need a ""Path Vaccine"" mask, and a patch.

Can you come over and get a piece of advice from an AIDS expert to stop the spread of the virus? That's exactly why I like to wear this in the holidays."
23,14,Isn't the US government actually putting up with this issue?
23,15,"'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You might need a ""Path Vaccine"" mask, and a patch.

I feel like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask, but"
23,16,You don't need a mask. You don't need a mask. Vaccination is a medical requirement of the government.
23,18,"He was actually actually joking about that part and it's pretty obvious that it is a joke and has nothing to do with the vaccines. But as another poster pointed out, this isn't the only vaccine that can help you. It's not a cure, it's an emergency. It's a vaccine to combat the spread of infectious disease. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. You can't get the right vaccination in the first place. Those things are just silly and a joke. But to me, they don't sound like"
23,21,I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this. Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
28,23,I am a little confused here. Can you give me a link to a wiki article that has more info about this - as opposed to just another list of comments here.
34,23,The article talks about how infecting a person with a virus would be different from getting a vaccine.
44,23,"What's not to know about the CDC, which is a large CDC organization?"
47,23,It's not illegal to wear a mask unless your doctor has a certificate that shows you are a doctor. That would be the same thing.
54,23,The government is trying to force you to wear a mask.
55,23,"You can go to any nasa website and see the FAQs, but it's not a valid explanation. It's a'very important topic' in public schools. It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it might, at least in the beginning. There are some other concerns of that kind, including not having the ability to be aware of dangerous people and their feelings."
57,23,"It's not a joke, it's a legitimate idea. It doesn't matter whether or not you are in the US, you do have to have a mask on. There's a lot of danger in the us, and this is one of the worst examples of that problem. There is no reason why the people who do not have a mask can be in the US."
63,23,I don't get why it's ironic at all that we are overreacting to people who are trying to stop this disease. Wood is a great way to stop people from getting sick.
75,23,I am not sure if I could have gotten sick from a pandemic. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
79,23,If you think people are going to make a decision on the issue a government agency that is in need of medical attention will not take on the issue with you.
84,23,"I think they're in their mid twenties, and they seem to not be much of an anti-HIV person. That is a terrible state to be in."
86,23,"The AMA is not a very good article because it is pretty much a ""How to get out of the house with a mask."" It is a very good piece of advice if you really want to know how to make people go back to their normal lives in the next few years."
97,23,"I don't think there are much more reasons for people to wear a mask than other people who might, but this is one of the more disturbing ones. People think wearing a mask to prevent a virus is good, but I think it's a good idea to wear a mask to prevent it, because it helps them avoid getting infected."
23,4,AIDS is a horrible disease. You shouldn't have gotten a vaccination unless you are sick and have a family of your own.
23,5,Vaccination is a medical requirement of the government. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. You can't get the right vaccine in the first place.
23,8,Are you a doctor? Because I wouldn't want to be with a doctor who isn't a doctor.
23,10,"There are actually several things that are not discussed on this sub, like how ""i believe that he was being a bit of a jerk for posting this but this doesn't sound like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask."""
23,14,"It's kind of hard to tell if the government really is trying to make the vaccines safe or not, given that we haven't seen a lot of the AIDS epidemic."
23,15,>Isn't the US government actually putting up with this?
23,16,"It's not a joke, it's a valid concern, it's one of the most important things in any social media site to mention this."
23,18,Vaccination is a medical requirement of the US government. You can't get the right vaccine in the first place.
23,21,The AIDS epidemic is very likely and the medical field needs to address that a lot more.
28,23,> [Claim the mask](http://sen.nyrr.ny.gov/reports/2013/01/Std/Srs_Vehicle.htm).
34,23,>wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,23,Vaccination is not a cure. It's a prank and it's not a joke. I think this is a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
47,23,It is in the OP's original post.
54,23,"If a pedophile and someone else in a relationship is taking advantage of the use of the word mask, that is an insult."
55,23,"I'm not sure who is really going to have a problem with what we're getting into, but the first time I saw someone wearing a mask I was like ""You could have made me want to start a new career,"" and that was the first time I saw the entire topic of ""eating a lot of bacon"" being discussed. So I took a moment to put the post together. I stayed there all day doing it and I'm pumped to show you the other parts of it."
57,23,It's a joke. The only way to avoid a pandemic is to take a mask off.
63,23,>the issue is that the order is still a bit confusing because the mask is not the one they are supposed to be wearing.
75,23,I want to share my experiences with the idea that I shouldn't wear a mask if I don't have health insurance. This has to do with the pandemics.
79,23,"There's no 'the first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is.'"
84,23,This is the first time I heard someone in this sub have a link about the Obama mask mandate.
86,23,"When I was a kid, I had a TB vaccine in the scleroscope, so I wore it. During the cold season, I would wear it on the other side of the house. That was just a temporary thing that I did on the way to school and to help kids. Now I have an TB vaccine, and after a year I can't go to the doctor and get tested for it. It is not a good idea to go outside if you haven't gotten tested. You can't do this if you haven'"
97,23,I would wear a mask to prevent a virus spreading. People wear masks to spread the virus.
23,4,There's a link on the wiki page on the government that gives people information about how to protect themselves from illness. They do not 'know' what a virus is and how to stop it from spread.
23,5,I have no idea who that is.
23,8,"They are a bad idea in the way that people are presenting a disease, or at least the CDC has deemed it to be. The reason the vaccines are required in the USA is because the government has a huge interest in making the public aware of the diseases that they are dealing with. Vaccination is not a cure. It's a prank and it's not a joke."
23,10,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not a cure. Vaccination is not a prank and it's not a joke. I think this is a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
23,14,I just got a second chance of making a joke about Obama and the mask mandate. Its kind of like a ripoff.
23,15,"I am a big fan of Obama's'suspect'and think he was joking, not joking."
23,16,Why are people wearing masks all the time? The problem with this is the medical aspect. Vaccination is a requirement for all government agencies. People are putting out the CDC warning signs and the CDC has put out warning signs. This is what the CDC said.
23,18,"You are a pedophile who is not a doctor, so you need a doctor who is a doctor."
23,21,> wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Are you a doctor? Because I wouldn't want to be with a doctor who isn't a doctor.
28,23,Yes. It's a joke. The fact that it's a joke does not make it a joke.
34,23,"There is a story on here somewhere: a man has been sick since he was 16 and has an actual virus. The government is not interested in giving people the information that the human body needs in order to get vaccines to help people, so he is not going to make such a joke."
44,23,I know a lot of people who think that the best way to stop AIDS is to have a Vaccination Campaign.
47,23,[NAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_spying/porn-porn) is a legitimate anti-virus advocate. It's one of the reasons why I've found that being a doctor without a mask to help the mother of an HIV victim is an important social service.
54,23,... a man who does not have HIV is infected with a mask and a face mask?
55,23,"My sons would wear a mask that I used in high school, and he'd go on a show about it at his school on Saturdays and Sundays."
57,23,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. They are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug."
63,23,The movie is not overdue. It's overdue. It's not overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. The movie is not overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. The movie is incredulous.
75,23,A joke is a joke. The way it is said is that people don't have the right to have health insurance and they don't want to deal with it.
79,23,"A little bit of both, but there are a lot of misconceptions of the idea and that the fact is not related to that. Putting on a mask while doing something id bet someone would probably take the jokes."
84,23,[The Obama mask mandate is often mistaken.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaskMandat_Event_Application_Is_Part_Of_An_Instinct).
86,23,">In my experience, being unvaccinated will actually save my life. You have to be in that position to get vaccinated as well, and you should get tested for it."
97,23,It's funny how you're telling a joke. The turban is part of the prevention of the spread of a virus and a joke.
23,4,What? Vaccines are a ripoff and it's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.

That, and their reticence to stop people from using vaccines. This is very similar to the CDC's stance on a bunch of jokes in the US a couple of years ago."
34,23,"The problem is that in the US it is a federal law that prevents a man from vaccinating himself by wearing masks. I see no reason to think otherwise, and I'm just trying to make this clear - I'm not a politician and I don't like being portrayed as a funny or funny person."
44,23,I'm not a doctor. You're being silly. I'm not saying he was making a joke at all.
47,23,People who wear masks are not going to get a treatment.

Whenever she told me that she did not think it was funny, I thought I could say I figured it was a joke or something, but I didn't know I was being really funny."
23,4,It sounds like your mom's joke to me. What is the point of a sneeze mask? I don't even understand why anyone would wear it when they're getting AIDS. I don't understand why you'd wear a mask on a day when your mother got AIDS and was still sick? You know what the doctor said?
23,5,"In a very unpopular opinion, the government has a duty to provide care for people with HIV or any other disease or other health affecting condition. The AMA was a legitimate attempt to make fun of the government. There's a reason that if the government does not comply, it's going to fail because it's not relevant."
23,8,"I think the answer to your question is not ""I can't believe it is a joke"" or ""I don't think it's funny to have it""."
23,10,"The CDC is making masks for TB patients for various reasons. One being to protect against an HIV infection or that one being to treat a disease is not a joke. That's called ""pretty serious"" but it's generally understood that it isn't a joke. Moreover, the CDC is attempting to force people to wear masks for TB to stop the spread of the disease."
23,14,This is a very serious and very true issue. I have seen plenty of videos that showed that the vaccines are not going to stop it. They aren't even as dangerous as we think they are.

34,23,I was referring to the problem of the CDC's policy that keeps people infected and to the fact that it's impossible to stop them from wearing the mask.
44,23,"This is a joke. It is an attempt to make fun of the government, which doesn't want to stop AIDS."
47,23,"A government mandated AMA on TB and the government's work to prevent TB would be a joke, too."
54,23,A hybrid mask and a face mask (I think) is a joke to make people feel uncomfortable.
55,23,That's a pretty simple thing. I'd like to have a guy wear a masked face in public and make a joke out of it.
57,23,Is a little nitpicking going to get a lot more interesting when you're trying to get to the bottom of things.

79,23,"If you want to stop putting on a mask while trying to fuck up the healthcare system in your area, and there's a virus on someone's hand, the CDC is going to have to rethink how to act. The whole idea of a mask mandate is not an absolute joke. The idea of a mask mandate is a joke, but it's more that people think it's a joke."
84,23,"I read this as, ""The CDC is trying to make it illegal."""
86,23,What’s the problem with AMAs? Why is there no other way to get a legitimate response?
97,23,Is it good that the CDC has put out a great resource called The CDC's Guide to Antiviral Hysteria? It sounds interesting.
23,4,Is the CDC not being a joke? Because that's a joke that you are doing....

23,8,"You haven't seen the movie, but it's still a movie."
23,10,It's overdue. It's overdue.
23,14,This has gotten so much sarcasm and I can't even begin to tell if that was the actual joke that prompted the movie.
23,15,CDC is trying to make the mask in the US illegal
23,16,"It's the whole point of the movie. It's been done for years. But, it's in the works, in the right way."
23,18,"So, how did the vaccine affect the entire country? Did it just make the country infected with a virus or something?"
23,21,People on AIDS are allergic to a lot of drugs. Vaccines are extremely dangerous to the person you're referring to if you want to be a doctor or someone else who is allergic to a certain type of drugs. And the risk of having an AIDS infection and not being able to take care of it is extremely high.
28,23,"What's more interesting is that most people in America are going to go around saying ""Nor can we be friends with someone else or a partner to help prevent HIV"" as a joke if they are not vaccinated."
34,23,"The problem of masks is that if you're 'as an AMA' in a public forum, the most relevant part is getting all the AMAs, and then telling that to the public, there's nothing about them."
44,23,I have had people who have resisted that AMA because it's very funny. It's funny because it's a joke that makes you feel better.
47,23,This is a huge omission from the joke.
54,23,"I'm not sure if this is a joke, but it is."
55,23,The NSA is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS in the United States.
57,23,A lot of people in Texas are sick. The CDC has been on the frontline for several years. You get sick when you have a good doctor.
63,23,I don't see how you could be saying it was a joke. What I'm saying is that the CDC has a long history of doing what it does but it's not going to go anywhere.
75,23,"People are going to have a hard time accepting that this is a joke, especially if they aren't already dying from an epidemic."
79,23,That's a great quote.
84,23,"The article is about an infamous bill about health insurance being paid to the government to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Apparently, the law is not being read as the mandate in that article."
86,23,"Nope. I'm not a doctor and I don't think the AMA is as good as the ones that were written by a lawyer, or a lawyer, but the way the AMA is written seems to make it seem like the AMA is about the government and the world's population."
97,23,"The CDC's Guide to Antiviral Hysteria' is a very good resource, not as good as it looks."
23,4,"Yes, it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
23,5,And the AMA was about the CDC doing a “medical mandate” to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. A lot of people in Texas are sick. The CDC has been on the frontline for several years. You get sick when you have a good doctor. I don't see how it could be considered a joke.
23,8,The AMA that is being made in the comments was actually about a person whose childhood experience was not a joke. It is an attempt to make it seem like a joke and it will not go anywhere.
23,10,The CDC is making masks for people with TB. They use them for things they may not have control over. The turban itself is not a joke.

97,23,"The CDC has put out a great resource called The CDC's Guide to Antiviral Hysteria. It's a very good resource, not as good as it looks."
23,4,Why does he get sick so quickly if he doesn't get vaccines?
23,5,"The AMA was made to promote a joke about people infecting others with HIV. The AMA and its propaganda are a pretty interesting idea, and the AMA is about the president making a joke about a public health issue, and his joke about a government slander is pretty funny. The AMA and his propaganda are really good, and you'd think he would have done better, given that the movie was about a pedophile putting his hands on the virus, and the AMA is just about a joke. I've read the article."
23,8,That is the reason the vaccines are mandatory.
23,10,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
23,14,"The vaccine mandate has not been going around for over a decade. The CDC has not been doing anything for a long time. They're simply trying to reassess it. If you want to start a conversation with someone about the issue and don't like it, then you should be the first person to say it."
23,15,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
23,16,"No joke, yes joke, no joke."
23,18,We need to have a new public health emergency.
23,21,"I'd say that being on a list that doesn't have the CDC equivalency to you, is a good way to start the process, but I don't think that it's a joke. It's about the fact that people who've not been vaccinated have never been on the list of potentially serious cases, and the idea of getting on the list of potentially serious cases is just a joke."
28,23,CANNOTANSWER:
34,23,It's a joke.
44,23,A lot of people think the AMA is a joke about a government issue.
47,23,''People who don't wear a mask are unlikely to get a treatment.''
54,23,"It's not a joke. Is the real joke a joke? No, not necessarily. Probably is a joke. If you're talking about a joke, don't mention it. If you don't like it, just do it. I'm not going to try to tell you a joke on the Internet, but if it's a joke, do it."
55,23,"So, what do you think about wearing a mask?"
57,23,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: I think the idea of a joke is just wrong."
63,23,CANNOTANSWER: The movie isn't overdue. It's not overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue. It's overdue.
75,23,"I don't think people should be allowed to wear a mask, because I'm not a very good person or have had the luck to get vaccines, but I do have a lot of experience with this one, especially with people who don't know what it is about."
79,23,"A little bit of both, but there are a lot of misconceptions of the idea and that the idea is not related to that."
84,23,"A mask mandate is just a joke. A law to restrict the number of lives saved or revoked is a joke. It's part of the Obama mandate, the medical industry must be able to legally support it in many other ways."
86,23,I don't think it's a joke. I think it's just a joke.
97,23,"I mean, I can tell you a lot. I'm a guy, a lot of guys say the same things."
23,4,"The real problem with vaccination is not the government, but the people who need to be vaccinated to protect themselves."
23,5,the AMA is about a joke about a government issue.

23,10,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""I think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That is the reason the vaccines are mandatory."
23,14,So the joke of not wearing a mask isn't a joke. It's a joke. And it's a joke.
23,15,The CDC and the US government have to work together to make this law illegal.
23,16,"People like to think their health is a joke, if they don't know how to stop it, then their privacy is a risk to them."
23,18,The story tells how the NSA and CDC should be making more vaccines to keep children safe from spreading a virus.

They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. The AMA on this topic is the best.
28,23,I'm not a doctor. I'm just a doctor. I'm just a doctor. I'm just a doctor. I'm just my doctor. I'm just my friend. I'm just my doctor.
34,23,The US has been a joke lately.
44,23,He didn't wear a mask and got infected with a virus. He was not 'vaccinated'.
47,23,"I have been sick for a while and I didn't have any time for the AMA. I know it's the CDC and the government. But the AMA is an important social service. It is about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. So, I'm the person who did the ""amazing"" AMA."

57,23,"It's not really a joke, it's just a joke."
63,23,The CDC should not be involved in the fight against the disease.

97,23,I'm a doctor and I have a huge problem with getting shit in my mouth and I can't understand how that is a joke.
23,4,What is the point of a mask for you?
23,5,"I don't think anyone in this thread has ever seen the AMA about what the AMA is about. I don't think it's anything close to what it is, just that people like the people presenting it a little different in every way."
23,8,"I read the article, too."
23,10,A few of these are still relevant in the AMA.
23,14,"Yes, it's a joke. It's a joke."
23,15,The AMA has to go on for weeks before it gets actually published.
23,16,People are putting out warning signs for the prevention of the spread of a virus.
23,18,Is a vaccine a joke?
23,21,"So, I'm not a doctor, because I'm not a doctor."
28,23,>I don’t know why people say that he needs to go in a mask and get vaccinated for HIV.
34,23,It's a joke because the CDC is a joke because they are not helping the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in the USA.
44,23,"I stayed in my own hotel room and have stayed out all day in the park all day. I don't have to wear any clothes in the hotel, I have to wear some clothing if I want to be alone. I think I should probably be dressed as an actor to prevent HIV transmission."
47,23,"I don't like the government, but I do think it's funny that some people don't wear masks. I think the joke is ridiculous and very insensitive to the public."
54,23,A CDC meeting isn't a joke; it's a joke.
55,23,"I don't think this is a joke. The idea is a joke, but it's a joke."
57,23,Isn't it a joke that doctors are supposed to have an AMA on their staff. Isn't that a joke?
63,23,It's funny because I don't think it's a joke and I think that's what it is.
75,23,"I know a lot of people who are attempting to tell the joke that the government isn't doing anything to prevent a pandemic. AMAs are all jokes about the government, not the AIDS epidemic. AMAs are also about the government making fun of it. The AMA is not a joke."
79,23,You're making me think a lot of people in Texas want to hear about this and think it's a joke?
84,23,I think you're right that there's no point in doing things like this.
86,23,Is there anything wrong with the AMA?
97,23,"The CDC, and its narrator, and its writer, have all gone on to mention it in detail."
23,4,"Its a joke that the CDC is trying to make fun of, I can't think of any way to be a joke about it. The government is trying to make fun of something that's not a joke. It's not just about the government."
23,5,Yes. This is a joke.
23,8,Is that the only part of this AMA I've heard that I can relate to?
23,10,The issue of masks at parties is far from trivial. This is not what AMA is.
23,14,"It’s a joke because you think it’s funny, but the point of the AMA is that people aren’t going to actually care about a problem when they don’t wear a mask."
23,15,>I was going to post the same thing here... I had to read it but it wasn't funny and I wasn't sure if i liked the concept.
23,16,"It's a joke if you have a lot of friends who like to wear masks, because the government can't be trusted to do anything to prevent the disease. They would not be able to 'not' know something about a disease because the government has to keep someone out of a person's life or the environment."
23,18,I'm afraid my husband and I haven't had the time to read the entire article.

79,23,Because we have a lot of issues with HIV and we want the government to do something about it. Using a mask mandate to stop HIV is a joke because it allows people to get their sick and get their sick.

97,23,"I'm not sure about the other two, but this is a joke. Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That is a really wacky joke.

23,4,"A friend of mine was diagnosed with AIDS and had one, and had to get some to prevent his eyes and mouth from getting blown out because it was so close to his nose. The doctor also said he grew out of it. That was an important part of the CDC and he was getting it at the right time. Thats why he wore a mask every day, I feel like he made a great choice."

23,8,You're not being a joke.
23,10,"Vaccination is not a joke, but it's still a joke."
23,14,Then what is the point of this AMA?

23,16,It's not a joke.

The AMA is an important social service, and is an important way to get your patients and the public to know that the government is working on stopping it."
54,23,I think the AMA is a joke. There is no real danger. 'My wife tries to say a lot to someone who’s in the know who doesn’t like to wear a mask because they are sick.'

You don't want to talk about the vaccine if you don't have a vaccine then don't wear it"
47,23,"AMA is just a joke. It's not about the government. It's about how the government is taking advantage of people. ''I'm not a politician, but I don't think they have the right to say anything at all about the situation."

55,23,"''You don't need a mask, you need a good mask''''', ''I'd like to have a guy wear a masked face in public and make a joke out of it."

They are not legal unless you are a doctor. What makes you think that the CDC is trying to make it illegal. They are trying to make it illegal.
86,23,"There's a lot of people who are not doctors, but don't know what's wrong with the AMA. AMA's are about the government, the government, and the world's population."
