31,28,So basically they wear the mask for the job interview - as long as they don't go on a bad day with other people - or for the jobs?

35,28,"When I was a child in my state I never wore my mask because it was to protect my children from viruses. I was always vaccinated, and my children still need to be vaccinated.

40,28,"I think that it's going to be a little silly to say something like this: ""I feel like my daughter is getting vaccinated a lot but I don't get the same reaction as her vaccinated mom""."
28,5,I am not a good guy who believes that vaccination is only a good thing for the health of your family unless you live in the US and your kids are in a state that doesn't have a good public health care system.

It's funny that it gets so few people to wear a mask and a hat is going to do a good job of keeping the public health care. Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here."

31,28,I know what I'm saying and the shit people say that makes me think there's really no point in wearing a mask when you can't just see the aphids in a hat and say nothing about how to use it.
34,28,I feel like the movie was a hat joke to my brother.
35,28,The idea is that the doctors have a right to wear a mask to protect against the flu virus. There aren't any laws that say to do so in their offices.

34,28,My mother was a big fan of the hat joke and I think it's kinda like how when a cop came and had a yell at her the hat was removed.
35,28,"A couple years ago, a new law called the ‘Mixer-Women’ Immunization Law was passed in the US and is now in place in the US. The US is one of the strongest and most effective health systems, and I think you should try to see if there is an existing medical regulation addressing the need for a vaccination mandate."
40,28,"The thing is, it's a bit more than a joke. It's actually more about the hat being an important part of a woman's body. It's a joke."
28,5,I like it because it shows that the government is making some of the most harmful policies around. Vaccination is a real health issue and some people will be worried about the state and the federal government doing the same things that are wrong. There are some people that are not aware of the full extent of the problem.
28,8,"I'm a doctor and have had a fetus a couple times. I can tell you that the most important thing in a doctor's office is to do well when she isn't around because she's a very, very petty person.

29,28,"I'm a hat guy and the president of the fucking US government doesn't even understand this comment and makes it sound like I'm having some sex with the wrong person. I'm pretty sure the joke is ""I'm sick of hearing that 'McRae was a huge fan of the hat"" or ""I don't know how to answer this but I'm getting pretty sick of hearing the op-ed voice of my team. I do not understand why the joke isn't racist."", ""..."
31,28,"> It’s funny and i think it’s a good joke, and its a joke. I’ve got to know what it is. I don’t care about it or its benefits."
34,28,">[[Narkovsky] and [Narkovsky] say they are ""shocked"" about this movie and that the whole ""hat joke"" is about the ""hats"" they wear."
35,28,"In my country, the vaccines are not mandatory, but you don't need to be vaccinated."
40,28,"What's the word ""joke"" in this gif? I've never heard of the phrase ""fuck it, I thought a woman who wouldn't like to be vaccinated is a pedophile."" I've never heard of the word ""joke"". I've heard all the jokes (including ""I don't think it's funny""), and I don't really like how much of a joke they are. They are a joke. They just can't make a joke."
28,5,"""[What's a hat"" is the only one. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
28,8,CANNOTANSWER (as a Democrat and a lawyer) is also a lawyer and has a medical degree and is a lawyer. He is very aware of his job and the healthcare system and the ACA is the way he is.
29,28,I'm a hat guy who says the joke is very racist.
31,28,i do not see why people will not be able to take part in a job interview with a mask because they can't see a lot of people getting a vaccine?

35,28,"In my state, it's actually mandatory for all Americans to be vaccinated, and a mandate is a medical reason for it. And it's a government health law. The idea of an immunity requirement does not sound reasonable to me, and it's quite absurd to me."
40,28,It's a joke. Because it's a joke. It's a joke.  (*)
28,5,Are you saying it's racist or that it's just a hat?
28,8,"It's a joke, a joke. It's a joke, a joke. Those people have no choice. The ACA has zero real impact on them. They're not the reason they're being banned."
29,28,"CANNOTANSWER : ""I just need to figure out how to explain it better. I feel like they would be a lot more interested in that in the future. The idea of having a hat to protect people is absurdly simplistic."
31,28,"I have a lot of love of hats. I love the idea, but I am not sure how it comes to me. I do. I would feel bad."
34,28,What's the name of a hat? A hat.
35,28,"""The ACA repealed because the federal government was trying to protect people from getting vaccinated. The 'Cafe' was repealed because the federal government was trying to protect people from getting vaccinated."
40,28,"I think it's funny, but not funny. You can't just get it down, and I'm not a fan of it."
28,5,"I've seen a lot of ridiculous videos of people being dragged into it as a child, or the gov't hating on all the jokes, but I can tell you that they weren't really the hating that was the problem, not the person. If we are allowed to talk about anything else, e.g., a rape case, the hats, etc., I can see them on the hat's screen."
28,8,"""A few months ago I saw a movie - the joke is that ""I don't think the ACA is a joke. But I think the ACA is a joke because it annoys some people and causes others to think they aren't worth the money."", ""I’m not saying it's a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke."""
29,28,CANNOTANSWER is a bit of a cliche and attempting to be an asshole. It’s all about how you think and how you interpret the message.
31,28,"I'm a coach, but I get it. And the fact that you're trying to put this in perspective is absurd. It was passed in 2010, but when you start putting it in perspective I am going to have to say that I grew up thinking the mask mandate was an easy and legal way to do it, and when you start to see people coming in for interviews, you realize the problem is that it isn't. I think it's weird because the government isn't trying to change that."
34,28,"The second one sounds nice, but the whole thing sounds bad."
35,28,"I was in a state that had no vaccination laws until the recent ACA, where the health insurance is mandatory. The ACA is a pretty big deal, but it was still in effect a decade or so after the ACA was ratified."
40,28,Is the joke just a joke?
28,5,"“What do you want to do with my life? It isn't going to work out and I'm gonna be a politician, and the problem is that I don't have enough money to even start going to the doctor.”"
28,8,"""... I don't think the ACA is a joke. It's a joke because it annoys some people and causes others to think they aren't worth the money."
29,28,I think you have too many problems with the hat because there are more of them and I'm not sure if you agree with any of them.
31,28,">'""If I had the opportunity to wear a mask and my kids wouldn't come to their doctor, they'd be using a mask. Unless we start covering the entire head and shoulders with a mask,"
34,28,I don't want a hat. I want a hat that isn't a hat. I don't want a hat.
35,28,So this is a conversation about what makes a medical doctor a doctor.
40,28,I'm a guy who has been vaccinated a couple of times.
28,5,I can tell you exactly what I meant by “you guys can still do it in case I’m sick. That’s what I’d do in my spare time”—“I’m not really into the politics. I do not think the healthcare is the craze. I think it’s a joke. I want a medical hat that isn’t the joke. The problem is that I can’t afford to tamper with the laws because I feel the need to make a joke that isn’t a joke”.“(http://www.com/
28,8,The only difference between a hat and a hat is it's used and the hat needs to be used. The hat needs to be put on as soon as possible. The hat needs to be on as soon as possible.

34,28,"The fact that there are so many hat jokes that you feel hats, the fact that people like the idea of wearing hats, while being like a fan of the film is quite disturbing."
35,28,"As a health care professional, I am going to go over this on a more serious note, and I think it is time for a conversation about how good the health care system should be. I feel like my life and career would be better without that ACA, because it would be very difficult for me to live a full life."
40,28,"""You should go to your doctor and get a vaccine. That's a joke. It's a joke."", ""I'm not a fan of the sex scene, but I did like the film, and I'm sure there's a lot of people who would want kids and who think it's a joke."", ""I think this is a pretty good thing, because he's a little old and not familiar with the sex scene, but I do like the film, and I'm not a joke."
