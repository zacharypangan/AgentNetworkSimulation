23,12,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
30,12,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable
31,12,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
36,12,wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym
39,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,12,woman come on guys says you gotta wear a mask to go in there woman if you re not vaccinated woman exactly woman s daughter my momma says she s naturally vaccinated
12,4,So this is why I'm in a hospital with my dad so I can go get tested for my virus.
14,12,"I wear a mask, it is uncomfortable and it makes me feel uncomfortable if it's in your face, because it s really tight and uncomfortable and he's sweaty - no?"
15,12,"As someone who grew up in Texas, I was surprised to see that we can still use a mask in some areas. It was nice being vaccinated and if you don't have it yet in California, you have to go in and buy a mask for a mask in order to get it."
21,12,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops wearing this mask and it being so hot
23,12,I would hate to go out to the grocery store and say that the next time I have a new and new friend I would do the same thing!
30,12,it was my first experience wearing a mask and I didn't like the tv. i'm a tv. i was a game coach and was vaccinated for it. i remember when it was in the back of the car and they put on my a mask.
31,12,It's an awesome thing you can wear one every time you're in the office or work out with people.

40,12,"I ve been vaccinated for about 8 years and I've never done anything, so I'm pretty sure I've never been in the wild, but I have the same reaction to vaccinating my daughter's mom."
12,4,"It's not your job to be in a hospital with your dad, it's your job to go get tested for your virus. The way they do that is a different situation. Having a family member who's vaccinated doesn't mean you have to do anything about it."
14,12,A guy has been sweating and it was so bad that he could walk away and not think about being covered and I think he needed a new mask.
15,12,I’d like to think that we can have some sort of medical service that can provide vaccination and the ability to wear a mask to protect you and your family from the disease. I can see why this would help - if they actually wanted to.
21,12,> I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask
23,12,"It doesn't seem like the mask mandate isn't lifted. This is an overreaction, and not only is it ridiculous, it's an overreaction. There are no laws against getting sick from a mask. They are laws for doing drugs. And that is a part of it."
30,12,I think the only way to tell that it s so hot is to get a hot shower.
31,12,You are talking about a part of the system that a vaccinated person wears to prevent the virus from spreading through the lungs and thereby preventing infection.

39,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,12,"I know.... and I have the same reaction to vaccinating my daughter's mom. It's like you're gonna die if you're not vaccinated to go in there, so you need a mask and a mask."
12,4,I'm assuming that the vaccine is a vaccine for someone with the disease and he wants to be the vaccinated parent to get it? If so then it's not your job to do something about it and is an option for a person who's not vaccinated and doesn't know how to get the vaccine.
14,12,This is the first movie I ever watched. It was really hilarious and I'm pretty sure most people would get sick and get some serious burns and other signs.
15,12,This sounds like the one thing that could happen at the next generation's birthday party:
21,12,"You got a good point and a good one, but I'm also so utterly dismayed at this, and I think it's a shitload of shit."
23,12,"There is a real, serious threat of inhaling a drug in your body."
30,12,"I don't believe it, and I'm gonna say it again, I have never been vaccinated, and I'm not sure if it's anything close to what people say."
31,12,"I think the point of a mask mandate is that, when people wear it, you put a mask in them and you use it to protect them. They wear a mask for job interviews, so if they didn't know the facts and a restraining order to be lifted, you'd have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask to protect the civilians."
36,12,"As a team, I'd rather coach than be an encumbered athlete. It's so easy to wear a mask, even without wearing a helmet."
39,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,12,"You can't say ""I love the op"" in that sentence, but it makes me chuckle..."
12,4,> A guy has been sweating and it was so bad that he could walk away and not think about being covered and I think he needed a new mask.
14,12,You can make a joke like this if you don't put them on. It's the only way to do it.
15,12,">Can we afford a helmet for my kids"" and it sounded like it'd be nice if it was lifted, but you could put your foot down and let your little finger down there and say Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,12,"I agree with a lot of the comments, but I think it's a shit load of nonsense. You're telling me the problem with this is that we are not the only ones doing it. You're telling me it is the problem with the administration. You're telling me that Obamacare will never stop and that we have no way of catching up on it, but the problem isn't you."
23,12,Vaccinations are a vaccine.
30,12,I don't understand the joke.
31,12,"I can't be the only one that's snide. I'm a teacher and I have a friend who wears a mask every day in class, and he's not doing anything. I'm afraid I'm not the only one that's snide. I've snide. And I don't really have a good grasp of the science behind it."
36,12,The reason why it's not important is because of the fact that this is a fetish.
39,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,12,>The Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon! I love how you put it on.
12,4,The problem with this isn't you. It's a fetish and not worth the effort to have a conversation with me about. I've never had a fetish. I have just come to the realization that when I am not vaccinated my kids will still need them.
14,12,"I'm so excited to see this movie. I can't believe I've heard the whole story: I just have a cold, and my hair gets so saggy and my face isn't cool!"
15,12,Is the bomber really going to get it? Typically the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. You have to show that the government doesn't need to wear a mask
21,12,"I'm an admin for the team, so I will just let my mom know I can't help her out because this isn't your business."
23,12,I feel like I read a lot more of your comments.
30,12,"I don't know how to think of it, but I do like the title a lot."
31,12,I'm not a lawyer but I think the problem is that the mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
36,12,"I don't know why you are being downvoted, but in a similar way I would consider wearing a mask while playing football when I was young. I wouldn't say I feel the need to wear it at work or work."
39,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,12,Is this what a man is like?

14,12,It is not cool for someone to think they are the same person but if they are the same. If someone is the same as you and you start seeing it then you are still a different person
15,12,"I've just heard the phrase ""People shouldn't have to put up with things like that unless they absolutely have to."" I'm going to use the 'I'm just a bit of a fan' part a little more."
21,12,"It is the problem with the gov, not the players."
23,12,This is one of those times where it's pretty obvious that the mask mandate is being ignored by Congress.
30,12,"I gotta say the title of this movie is so bad that I can't even relate to the whole point of this post - I have to leave it at that and look back at it - in my life, when it was the first time I read it, I thought it was a joke. I've never heard anyone say something like that and I'm a big fan of the style but I'm getting upset at you. You really didn't realize that this was a joke, or that it's a joke. : '"
31,12,I think the problem is that the mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.

23,12,It’s ridiculous how it’s used to cover everyone. I’ve been a medical professional.
30,12,"I can see that your comments make you think that this kind of people are being unreasonable, and you're going to have a tough time understanding how you have to explain it. I'm going to make your point about how you could probably use more humor, but I really don't think I'd have a hard time explaining the title, I'm trying to think of some different ideas on the matter. I just don't want to do it."
31,12,You can't be a politician without a mask and still be the candidate for the office of a member of the government. That's why the ACA was created and you can't have a government policy.
36,12,"The part where she said she feels that she is being sexist, and that this isn't a big fetish, is: 'As a team, I'd rather coach than be an encumbered athlete.
