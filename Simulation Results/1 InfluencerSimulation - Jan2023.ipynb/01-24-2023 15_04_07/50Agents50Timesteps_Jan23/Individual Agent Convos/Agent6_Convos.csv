40,6,I love how you put it on.

6,2,I've gotten the following:
18,6,What do you mean the no masks act in a way where they infect the skin of the person who wears the mask?
24,6,"I know there are plenty of ways for people to get the vaccines out. If he is allowed to remain in office he is still not going to be able to provide vaccines for any of his constituents, regardless of the mandate, but he is a major part of the issue."
29,6,"There are no real alternatives to getting vaccinations. You're being blunt. What is a virus? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. That would be a bad fit with this state i think."
40,6,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon! I love how you put it on. This is what my mother said to me when she had to be vaccinated and she told me she wasn't vaccinated. And it happened to her all the time.

18,6,"They do not prevent the virus. You want to avoid the virus? No, that's not a joke."
24,6,"A person who is unable to work is an unqualified person, which is to say the most important part of the system."
29,6,It's a very strange and well known fact that vaccinations are currently banned by Obamacare for every patient in the United States. People who have had them for years say it is a disease and that it is a way of getting infected. It is not an anti-virus but it is very powerful. You need to take that into account and use that as a warning.
40,6,I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has.
46,6,i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
6,2,People in Florida CAN wear the mask. They can get contaminated by anything if they want.
18,6,That is a true 'joke'.
24,6,"I don't see this as the 'future' of the US government vs the future of our country. Rather, it's more of a political issue than a health issue - and I don't think that this is true."
29,6,I would love for the gov to do something about it if they would have an alternative to the mask mandate. I'm glad you didn't think I was racist. It is a bit of a cliche to say you're racist.

6,2,"I'm sorry, but we can't get a vaccine to be removed from the hands of this guy."
18,6,"[Short for the phrase ""i hate a mask""](http://nawp.edc.gov/index.html). You don't have to wear a mask. There are some doctors that actually use them in the clinic, which may be a problem for some people. But that is just one example of one of them. They just don't know how to use them. It's a little like saying, ""If you can't see a bad mask does not prevent the virus, I hate it."""
24,6,>I think there is a lot of bias in how people see Obamacare because it's just a government mandate to be held by the voters of a state. I guess that's a lot of strawmen.
29,6,"The video shows the bomber not being able to pick up a weapon - the hammer, the pistol, the shield, the hammer, or the full-body mask."
40,6,I'm just wondering if your wife thinks that if you're vaccinated it's important that you stay vaccinated.
46,6,It has the best reputation in a game.
6,2,I like the way you think. It's a real 'fact' that's pretty hard to tell because there is a 'lot' of bias and it isn't just a political thing that it's going to happen.
18,6,You mean the CDC needs to make it mandatory to wear a mask?
24,6,That's exactly the type of situation that's made a big difference in preventing children from getting the vaccines despite not understanding the true meaning.
29,6,"I mean you're being quite naive and being obtuse. You have a good point about health care, and you have a good point."
40,6,I think the biggest thing about a man being unvaccinated is that she has no idea what a woman is like. I don't think it makes her seem like a pedophile.
46,6,"I am an irl and when i see a mask, i am a fucking liar. The thing that I do is take a break for a second and watch what i do when i play basketball."
6,2,There isn't really any basis to why they don't go to court. But they can't just tell you what to do with the mask.
18,6,"They should make it mandatory to wear a mask, even though that is a joke. I do like the jokes. I find it funny that the president of the United States has a great idea that the CDC needs to make it mandatory that people wear a mask, even though that is a joke."
24,6,Are you referring to the fact that Obamacare is just a nationalized issue?
29,6,I have a feeling you are being pretty obtuse. You don't seem to have an opinion about health care.
40,6,">I don't know what a man is like, but I just think this is something that needs to be addressed."
46,6,"This was my favorite post ever... The only time I've ever heard it in action was when I told my teammates that I had a mask and wanted them to know. They had already told me, “If I was on the field, I would not have any problem getting a helmet on if a player was wearing it. I would go up to the head and say, ‘That’s so freaking adorable!’ and then when they said “Oh, this’s a helmet, I wouldn’t want to go to the court.”"
6,2,You have to take them to court.
18,6,"That's a pity the CDC is trying to do something so stupid that they are trying to make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's like saying, ""We don't know how to use them."""
24,6,Is it true that people are able to get vaccines because they do not understand the true meaning?
29,6,"The video shows the bomber not being able to pick up a weapon - the hammer, the pistol, the shield, the hammer, or the full-body mask. [Aw oh man I need to see this video. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask"
40,6,Vaccination mandates are more popular.
46,6,r/relationships is a completely different place for the different types of people.
6,2,"I don't think that there is a reason they don't want to put a cap on women whose hands are contaminated with drugs. You are being completely dismissive of their concerns, and they are not entitled to know what a woman is. You can bet there is a r/relationships subreddit dedicated to r/vaccines, but you can't, because you're not the one who has to decide whether or not you want to be vaccinated."
18,6,The President and the President have stated that the CDC needs to make it mandatory that people wear a mask.
24,6,The fact that he's trying to explain the fact is a little disturbing.
29,6,CANNOTANSWER: This guy is garbage and utah needs to get rid of him gitmo would be a good place for him gop sen mitt romney votes with democrats to keep masks mandate for toddlers.
40,6,And there is one more reason why people don't get vaccinated: because it makes them more likely to fuck it up. Its not a joke.
46,6,''I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
6,2,I don't know how someone that would get away with having a'mask' on a team who wasn't vaccinated would do if they didn't have a mask.
18,6,It's so ridiculous. This is a pretty stupid problem.
24,6,The gist of the discussion is that he has to decide the best way to provide vaccines to the most qualified individuals on the planet.
29,6,"A guy who went to the gym, to get a helmet and a mask is going to do a good job of keeping the public health care. A bunch of sarcastic and sexist comments."
40,6,"Vaccinations mandates are more popular. They're better for people who haven't got it. It seems that a lot of vaccinated people don't like the idea of having kids, especially since many do. It seems that a lot of guys will annoy you when people don't get vaccinated and get a new one in the future, or they will try to avoid them for themselves."
46,6,So you're saying I love coaching and I hate people who are in that position?
6,2,>Do you like wearing a mask? It’s like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one?
18,6,I found it funny that the president of the United States has a great idea that the CDC needs to make it mandatory that people wear a mask.
24,6,This is so much like how a guy argues that a mask is the answer to the problem.
29,6,">It's like a troll who’s on the irs and can’t get a job or a job, and tries to be funny or be a dick to a random person. There are many examples of racists with masks, but a few are also racist."

18,6,I just started a new job and I was working at a hospital and I didn't have to wear a mask to protect me from viruses and the worst part was that I was already prone to infections.
24,6,Is there a specific reason why people are not getting vaccines at all? Is there some kind of thing that is making the problem more complicated?
29,6,It's about the government being a fucking jerk for their political positions.
40,6,I like the concept of not getting vaccinated. I just think it's funny how it could affect people who aren't vaccinated.
46,6,This post seems a lot more reasonable. Obviously you're just trying to be sarcastic.
6,2,"They really do need to change the rules so that if the mask is not worn correctly, it can become a health issue."

40,6,Yes. Vaccination mandates are more popular. They're better for people who haven't got it. It seems that a lot of vaccinated people don't like the idea of having kids.
