25,18,i was downtown dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame
31,18,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
39,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,18,says the no mask wearing breaker of hers laws to get her ends dyed
18,2,A good if he doesn't wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn't infect anyone else
18,3,"I have an old X-Men mask, it works like a charm. But not with a new one. It doesn't need to be worn to make it infect other people."

25,18,So the guy wearing a mask on the sidewalk should make it to the gym without having to wear a mask?
31,18,I'm a guy who's going to resign from coaching because my players won't be wearing the mask...

18,3,"I think my brother, who's a doctor, is one of those guys. She tells me he can't wear a mask because he is unable to move. I am convinced that she should stop wearing a mask."
18,6,What do you mean the no masks act in a way where they infect the skin of the person who wears the mask?
18,7,"i was in dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,9,"I don't think the word ""infecting anyone else"" applies. In fact, the word ""infecting someone else"" could be used as a metaphor to describe a group of people. If one person is in an X-Men mask, the X-Men can get some bacterial or viral infections. Similarly, if someone's body isn't infecting anyone else, the word ""infecting someone else"" could be used as a metaphor to describe a group of people wearing a mask in their body. If you can't see"
18,14,a bad mask does not prevent the virus and if you wear a mask it can stop the spores from spreading.
25,18,Is it true that it should be mandatory in utah?
31,18,It's not a joke.

44,18,It's in the word to me. It's in the word to you.

18,3,"It's a little like saying, ""What do you mean the no masks act in a way where they infect the skin of the person who wears the mask?"""
18,6,"They do not prevent the virus. You want to avoid the virus? No, that's not a joke."
18,7,"That is such a sad story. It's funny, but there is something else that isn't really needed."
18,9,I’m going to give you my best advice:
18,14,"OP, the CDC has found that the presence of the virus is important enough that they should make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not ""infecting anybody else"" - ""infecting anyone else."""
25,18,"You did an excellent job on your post, I am a proud and loyal member of the Obamacare team and I’m really glad you have been here."
31,18,You have a really good understanding of the issues involved in the prevention of aphids.
39,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

18,2,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's funny, but there is something else that isn't really needed."
18,3,"I would just say ""If you can't see a bad mask does not prevent the virus"" and see if I can see how it goes. It makes sense that the disease isn't going to be in a different phenotype. I'd just say, ""If you can't see a bad mask does not prevent the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
18,6,That is a true 'joke'.

25,18,You can't even be on the Obamacare team without one of those guys? You're just telling me he's not going to have to change. I don't understand that the Obamacare plan is a terrible idea.
31,18,"People are being pissed and not resigning because the aphids are showing up. If your teammates don't get the aphids, then your coach is screwed, if you're willing to quit, you won't resign. I think the message of the mask mandate is that people are being pissed and not resigning."

18,7,"It's a great thing that the CDC made it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not just a joke. It's the actual problem, and not the vaccine."
18,9,"I can’t imagine why everyone is so nervous about the aphids. I’ve never even heard of this in a real life, and I’ve never seen it. I also do not think that it’s a joke."
18,14,"I hate it. When I think I'm in danger of getting an infection, I think of these jokes as... ""If you can't see a mask doesn't prevent the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
25,18,I was in that situation when the guy was wearing a mask on the sidewalk.
31,18,"I don't really see what the ""masked mandate"" is about. Is there a 'fake' mask mandate?"
39,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,18,I think you're being a little poetic in this one.
18,2,"As someone who hasn't been in any of these situations, I can tell you that I am a little poetic about this one."
18,3,"I agree that the CDC is a horrible tool to use, but the problem is that in the future they will try to help people without it. But there are some people who think that a mask is going to help their dick get better and a good bit more resistant."
18,6,You mean the CDC needs to make it mandatory to wear a mask?

44,18,"I have been making jokes, and I've been in the middle of a conversation."
18,2,"The joke that is being made is very similar to the joke that is made about doctors being embarrassed that a doctor might not be willing to do something like ""I wouldn't wear a mask."""
18,3,I have a friend who has a mask on and she said that she would wear it for an hour if the weather's clear. That she's in a hot weather zone where it's humid. That's not a bad thing because she's allergic. That's like telling your mother that her husband wants to be in the world with a mask.
18,6,"That's a pity the CDC is trying to do something so stupid that they are trying to make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's like saying, ""We don't know how to use them."""
18,7,"I don't know how to describe this quote correctly, but what do you mean by that?"
18,9,This is one of those things people in the CDC have said to me all the time. I don't have a reason to feel guilty for wearing a mask. I just think it's a bad idea and there are times when the CDC doesn't even realize that it is necessary and only that people are doing it.
18,14,"Basically, ""I wear a mask to prevent the CDC from preventing people from getting sick""."
25,18,"I don't get how a lot of people are getting sick because they don't have masks, so they're not even allowed to wear them in public. The CDC is not a good slur, and they are not correct."

18,7,"The CDC has to make this more transparent : ""Isn't it nice if we're both wearing masks? Do you have any idea why that is?"""
18,9,I can't get the joke that a person with a mask wears a mask to prevent the CDC from preventing them from spreading a virus.

18,14,"I'm not saying it's bad or not, but it's like saying a joke about a doctor not having a doctor on his helmet and not wearing a mask? I think I was the only one who knew I had a CDC mask because I hated the word aphid. I don't know why people hate the CDC, but it is so stupid and stupid."
