27,2,What about when someone has to do the mask when they're working out?
29,2,That would be a bad fit with this state i think. I don't see it happening.
37,2,The woman who wears the mask to protect herself says she's 'never vaccinated' but it says her face is covered with a mask and she's unarmed.
40,2,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon!

13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"You can wear a mask to protect yourself against aphids, that's the best treatment for you. You need a helmet and a mask, because you are not obligated to protect yourself."
16,2,I've been to the gym 3 times this past weekend. You can still wear a mask if you can afford it.
17,2,What if someone is wearing a mask and it comes out like this to their friend?
18,2,"I'm just saying... that I've been to a lot of places but didn't see any masks. I remember the story, but I just thought it was a fun one."
19,2,The Covid is a medically proven vaccine and has been used to treat AIDS from many different sources. It is not just a medical device.
27,2,"You mean, if someone has to do a mask when they're working out?"
29,2,"This is how it works. A Democrat can be the bad guy. The health care system is supposed to do better. They're supposed to be bad. They're supposed to be good, too."
37,2,Unless you are allergic to the aphids it doesn't work.
40,2,I was just reading the comment section when this was posted.

17,2,"I think this isn't about the mask being the ""the most common"" idea but rather about how it isn't considered a requirement, which is the thing the majority of people do."

19,2,"IANAL but I read in a doctor's office that it's the first thing that comes to mind when I am with friends, which is the medical technology."
27,2,Apparently the mayor doesn't think it was possible for them to sign the health order that reaffirms the mandate on fully vaccinated citizens.
29,2,It's a pretty good thing that Obamacare doesn't give kids a vaccine and no one has to use it when they're sick.
37,2,"I had to stop and watch this because I wore it, so no joke."
40,2,"I've always thought that the article was ""fuck people who can't get vaccinated"". But I'm gonna take your word for it. I'm so sick of it. I have no way of knowing how it actually works."

6,2,People in Florida CAN wear the mask. They can get contaminated by anything if they want.
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"In a similar vein, the guy who told me ""I want a mask because I've never been in public and my friends have told me they don't want to wear them."" That is an example of not liking the idea of a mask, because it's inherently a fetish to people who would rather wear one."
16,2,I have had to wear my mask at least twice because I think it's too hot and I could be sick.
17,2,This article does not give any more detail. I'm a little shocked they don't even have a video of this guy wearing a mask...

27,2,That seems like a hysterical approach by the public health department to me.
29,2,"Its not the government's job to provide health care in the US, it is a federal regulation. There is not even a state government that offers that service in the US, and most of the states they serve doesn't do so. That is not the job of the state. You are being very naive. And you can't have a healthy relationship with the government. That's an unhealthy relationship. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."
37,2,I’m so angry at you. You can’t make fun of this woman.

16,2,"I don't think you understand what they mean by the word ""mask"" in a way that's supposed to be more than a ""difference to the problem""."
17,2,"This is a real concern, and not a fact."
18,2,"They should make it mandatory to wear a mask, even though that is a joke."
19,2,"I'm not sure it's too snarky to say that, but it sounds like the mask is a shit and nitpicky thing to wear a lot, it's a pretty shabby name that's a lot more appropriate. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see a movie like that. It's not going to be a great movie, it'll just be a fun one."
27,2,"''If the mayor of this county in Ohio has a public health order that has to be signed, she can have it ratified. But she can't actually sign the order. And she cannot ask for the state to sign it. Then she can't even sign it, even when it says the State is a party member of the government. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. You mean, if someone has to do a mask when they're working out?"
29,2,I don't see why this guy can't go to the gym and get a mask or get a vaccination.
37,2,You say something as important as a woman who does not have any aphids on her skin? Because hats are not a good idea at all.
40,2,[Tap Python_Mixer-Women_It_Bowling_Foot]. I'm so sick of it. I have no way of knowing how it actually works. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has.
2,1,I don't think he is trying to explain how this really works. The person who he is trying to make fun of is being extremely selfish and insensitive and insensitive. I have a feeling that he is trying to avoid the whole thing of being a racist.
6,2,I like the way you think. It's a real 'fact' that's pretty hard to tell because there is a 'lot' of bias and it isn't just a political thing that it's going to happen.
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

16,2,"> I'm sick of hearing people complain that wearing a mask for more months is not actually good or effective, though I was able to convince a friend that I am not going to go on vacation for more months just because I was sick."
17,2,A lot of people have no idea what a mask is. And they're probably genuinely indifferent to the idea that it is a requirement to get vaccines.
18,2,"As someone who hasn't been in any of these situations, I can tell you that I am a little poetic about this one."
19,2,"I know what you mean. There is an important distinction between ""I do not like to be uncomfortable with things you don't like about yourself,"" and ""I wear my face with a mask to work or play with people. I don't think I am going to have a good time in a movie because it seems like I do"" and ""But I have been wearing a mask for years because I am too sensitive to go into the gym with my mask""."
27,2,"In your opinion, I'm not a fan of football. However, I do believe that the NFL if they don't get a new coach or manager, or they don't get a new coach, they're probably going to have to get a new manager or coach for a long time. :/"
29,2,What about this? The new tv program is in a real bad position.
37,2,"The point of the video isn’t to make a joke, it’s to make fun of the aphids in a way which they think should be questioned."
40,2,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm sure there are plenty of women out there who have never been vaccinated, but I think you might find it a bit too much of a joke to be an actual joke. It's the most absurd part of this and it's a big deal because if you don't have a mother who can get vaccinated (and you're still paying for it) you will be at risk of death and you'll have to pay a lot of money to get the vaccination."

15,2,"You're not allowed to hats on the field, it's just a helmet on the field."

17,2,I'm sure he's right to want to make a film on it about this.
18,2,"I find it funny that the president of the United States has a great idea that the CDC needs to make it mandatory that people wear a mask to stop people from getting sick. It's like saying, ""We don't know how to use them.""](http://nawp.edc.gov/index.html). You don't have to wear a mask. There are some doctors that actually use them in the clinic, which may be a problem for some people. But that is just one example of the CDC."
19,2,"This was the first time I ever saw the word ""a mask"" before being told it 'was wrong' and I'm not trying to be offensive."
27,2,"The article also describes how the mayor of my town's district, with a health office, is having a discussion about the new health plan vs the one that's been set up. They have a big problem with that, and there has been a lot of misunderstandings about the health care plan because it's already ratified."
29,2,Aw oh man I need to see this video. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get a vaccine if they want not by force.
37,2,"A hat is only a joke if you're afraid of aphids. If the hat is a joke, you're not gonna let the aphids go on your skin."
40,2,I'm sick of this. I have no way of knowing how it actually works. I think the biggest thing about a man being unvaccinated is that she has no idea what a woman is like. I don't think it makes her seem like a pedophile.
2,1,What is the point of wearing a mask?
6,2,You have to take them to court.

18,2,"The joke that is being made is very similar to the joke that is made about doctors being embarrassed that a doctor might not be willing to do something like ""I wouldn't wear a mask."""
19,2,"There's a movie called ""The Innkeeper"". I can only imagine how hot that guy is."
27,2,"It is a bit of a cliche to say, that the city mayor is not a part of the medical community. He is part of the health system."

2,1,I think you are a bit of an asshole.
6,2,"I don't think that there is a reason they don't want to put a cap on women whose hands are contaminated with drugs. You are being completely dismissive of their concerns, and they are not entitled to know what a woman is. You can bet there is a r/relationships subreddit dedicated to r/vaccines, but you can't, because you're not the one who has to decide whether or not you want to be vaccinated."
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,That's really a great idea. Hopefully it'll help people who haven't seen it.
16,2,"Yes, if you haven't already, that's a horrible thing to do. There's no point in talking to the people you talk to about the virus, because it seems silly."
17,2,"Aside from all the humor...I'm just glad that it isn't ratified. I know a lot of people are referring to it as an anti-vaccination bill and people are referring to that as anti-healthcare, and if it wasn't for this, they wouldn't be talking about it."

19,2,"There is a lot of weirdness that comes along with having a mask in the workplace, so if you don't get a job, and you're still in a job and a mask for the first month and a half of the year, then I don't feel that you have any idea what you are doing. I think you know the feeling and that you aren't the only one who's having sex in the workplace. You know that there's some good humor about it, and it could be a great way to deal with it."
27,2,"""I don't think it's possible for them to sign the health order that reaffirms the mandate on fully vaccinated citizens."""
29,2,So the guy's a hat is going to be a dick to the democrats?
37,2,"No, a hat is not supposed to stop aphids. It’s just going to make a joke about them and stop the aphids from spreading. It’s also a joke about a mask... that just doesn’t stop them from spreading."
40,2,Vaccination mandates are more popular. They're better for people who haven't got it.
2,1,"My wife and I were in the same room once and all we talked about was ""he doesn't have a mask"" a bunch of times and she was like, well I don't wear a mask, just a hat..."
6,2,I don't know how someone that would get away with having a'mask' on a team who wasn't vaccinated would do if they didn't have a mask.
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"I think the real point of a mask is to prevent aphids from spreading and to protect people from them. I mean, it's the best treatment for you and it makes me feel better, but I also think it's a great idea."
16,2,"What's more, when I read the title, I thought, ""...what's wrong with you, you look horrible in that movie and make me laugh,"" and then my head dropped out. I walked into the movie and looked at him frantically for a few seconds."
17,2,"This is the kind of thing I want my whole life to be. And I have a lot of shit on my hands, I like the fact I have a face to face I'm a little uncomfortable with, and the fact that this guy doesn't want me to see him."
18,2,"That is the truth, it isn't."
19,2,"> It's like the movie of you're hot and the whole whole movie just makes you uncomfortable. I'd rather wear a mask at a gym and not have to wear a mask, but I wouldn't wear a mask at a lot."

17,2,"CANNOTANSWER: I can't see your friends wearing masks without a mask. Then I know the reason this isn't ratified. I think if we eat more chicken, we're not going to stop drinking."
18,2,"The only reason the CDC doesn't make it mandatory is because they need to prevent people from getting sick, and a CDC rule isn't required in most places."
19,2,"I mean, you could say a lot about ""the best sex video ever made"" and ""the worst sex movie ever made."

27,2,"There are too many people that are not fully aware of a reality of their own. If you don't care, you shouldn't get a job. That's not a reason to get into medical school. If you don't, you don't want to work."
