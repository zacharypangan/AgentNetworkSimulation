43,3,It is more likely that this isn't really part of the order that ratifies the new public health orders. The mayor can't sign the new public health order until it's completed.
43,5,It is important to note that the order ratifies the mandate and you can't ratify a health order for a lack of a mask mandate without a mask. Adding the mask to the mandate is a 'probable violation' for this change.
43,9,"Yes, OP is in the middle of the fight, because of this insistence of the mayor and the public health organization."
43,17,"A majority of the population are vaccinated by vaccination, and so are some in the public health system. The vaccinated population has to go through a LOT of different processes to get vaccinations, but also have to be in a location that isn't vaccinated with them. There's also a government advisory board that isn't required to follow all mandates."

43,31,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed!
43,33,The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate.
43,35,"Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."

43,3,The mayor of a county in Ohio is a party member of the government. You do not have to vote to sign any public health orders. The councillor has to ratify these 'public health orders'.
43,5,It doesn't change the fact that the mask mandate is repealed by the ACA. It's not the first time that the mandate has been ratified.
43,9,Keeping the mandate alive is not the same as getting off the health order until it is done.
43,17,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed! The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate.
43,27,"I'm very happy to see that the mayor has been supportive of this, but I can't think of a single mayor that would have voted against it and be able to get the mayor to sign the order"
43,31,"The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate. Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."
43,33,[Peter J. Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter) writes an article stating the city's stance on what is necessary to vaccinate a public health patient.
43,35,"OP is in the middle of the fight, because of this insistence of the mayor and the public health organization."
43,38,I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.
43,3,Why do you believe that a city has to have its health health officials sign up for mandates that are repealed? What is the point of a public health order that doesn't want to be ratified? Why not sign up for a mandate?
43,5,This is a great change of phrase.
43,9,"In my state, a citizen may not get a job because they're working at a public health organization. I think there are a lot of different reasons why the ACA can't be repealed."
43,17,"You sound pretty incompetent. But, you're a good fucking fucking man, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you back out of your head. The mayor should have voted for this if the city was required to sign the mandate. The mayor should have voted against this, because you don't know the shitlords and the government."
43,27,> I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.

43,38,EDIT: I'm a bit more skeptical about the mayor's stance on the mask mandate than what he writes.
43,3,> There is a lot of different reasons why the ACA can't be repealed.
43,5,"So if the health board did not consider the effect of the mandate to be a ""good thing"" it isn't a good deal and the mayor's decision to ratify this is a good deal."
43,9,"I feel like you're making the point that you're incompetent if you can't tell me what the ACA does, and that the ACA doesn't make that up to you."
43,17,"I think if they signed the mandate, the people with the ACA would not have been in the health care system."
43,27,"If the mayor of this county in Ohio has a public health order that has to be signed, she can have it ratified. But she can't actually sign the order. And she cannot ask for the state to sign it. Then she can't even sign it, even when it says the State is a party member of the government."
43,31,The fact that a man who wants to change the ACA is a red flag.
43,33,"He reaffirmed his authority in the legislature, and as a result, he has made several sweeping changes that could have potentially been made. Including repealing a part of the health care program that he has created in order to protect the citizens who need care, and a state that has a health insurance program which does not do so."
43,35,"Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."
43,38,"If the council did not vote on this, then the council would probably have a vote. That being said, the state should make an effort to change the ACA's language to ""do not have a mandate"" in order to save money."
43,3,"The fact that the mayor of the county in Ohio has a public health order that has to be signed, she can't actually sign it. And she can't even sign it, even when it says the state is a party member of the government."
43,5,"This is what the doc says about the councillor's health care, but the mayor has to ratify that because it's a 'big deal'. That's not a good deal."
43,9,A person who works for an insurance company is an insurance company. The mandate is not the same as having an insurance company sign up for them.
43,17,I think the first part is more about the fact that the mayor can't even sign the order. But the second part is that the ACA doesn't even make up to the mayor.
43,27,The city council is working to make that move a piece of shit in order to save money.
43,31,"CANNOTANSWER: 'I feel like you're making the point that you're incompetent if you can't tell me what the ACA does, and that the ACA doesn't make that up to you."
43,33,Those who are not a part of the public health care system have no say in what sucks. It would probably be the state's fault and you could also go to the senate and have the senate approve the senate health program.
43,35,"""Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."""

I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole."
43,3,Are there any other reasons that could be put in place to prevent the health boards from reauthorizing the ACA?
43,5,"So when we first moved in to Ohio we had to agree to the change, in some cases there was a change in the way the mandate was written and that they endorsed it. I'm also not saying it's a bad deal, but if a city council member voted to not repeal it, it was the right thing to do."
43,9,"If a state had a law that made the law repeal, the health board would be responsible for removing that law. If that law had not been repealed, the law would have been revoked and the state would have done nothing."
43,17,i have a state that's very liberal and i'm not sure I think i am the only one who doesn't think the people with ACA would have been able to get vaccinated by vaccination. i do know that a small majority of the people who are not vaccinated aren't going to go through a LOT of different processes to get vaccinations.

43,35,I think OP is right. The ACA does not make the city an asshole in some ways. The ACA doesn't make up to the councillor.

43,9,"That doesn't sound like the ACA's legislative agenda is a good idea. It's not, unfortunately, a big deal to the voters and isn't a good thing. It's like allowing people to have to sign the health order themselves, which isn't a big deal."
43,17,There are other reasons why the ACA would not be ratified.
43,27,There was a vote that passed in the US House and this was a no-no. The ACA was repealed and the ACA's provisions could not be repealed. The state needs to come up with some new rules that would help with the problem.

43,5,I'm going to say I can't believe the way the ACA's provisions are passed in Congress in the past 5 years.
43,9,That's the big deal.
43,17,The only reason the ACA was repealed is because it was passed. They can't reauthorize ACA unless that mandate is repealed.
43,27,A good majority of these issues would be snuffed out. The mayor of the county could have some of the policies that are being ratified.

43,5,This isn't a law that is passed in a vacuum. It was a ratification of the mandate because it was not repealed.

43,17,I'm just wondering how people know that this is a nonsense issue. Why do we believe this is a problem in our country? Does it make us feel better about ourselves or does it make us more happy that we don't have our own health insurance? Isn't it sad that our healthcare is at the heart of the problem?
