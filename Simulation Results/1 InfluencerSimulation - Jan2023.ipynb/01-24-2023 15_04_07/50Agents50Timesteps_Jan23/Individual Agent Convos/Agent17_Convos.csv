43,17,breaking indianapolis city county council has voted to ratify new public health orders which include removing the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals the health orders now go to the mayor to be signed

17,2,I'm wearing a mask to a friend of mine. I think a little mask like this would give him a feeling of security.

17,5,We have this kind of mask on here in philadelphia. The mayor of philadelphia has asked if you'd like to go there because you want to protect yourself.
17,7,"You can have your own bodyguards that are at your service, but you need to be in the best shape possible."
17,8,If you don't wear a mask a lot you can't be an vaccinate holder. Its like having you rip your dick off when you go to a store to buy food to cover your mouth.
17,11,I’ve heard this in the last couple of days.
17,13,I think the mayor of Indianapolis should be charged with preventing people from doing this.
31,17,"OP, here's a great one: it helps that a mask is worn before the game starts and then it's on and off."
40,17,>seciation of the mask
43,17,"A majority of the population are vaccinated by vaccination, and so are some in the public health system. The vaccinated population has to go through a LOT of different processes to get vaccinations, but also have to be in a location that isn't vaccinated with them. There's also a government advisory board that isn't required to follow all mandates."
48,17,I've always wanted to use my mask to kill the virus. It was a pain in the ass but it's worth it.
17,2,What if someone is wearing a mask and it comes out like this to their friend?
17,3,"This is the worst. There are a lot of people vaccinated by their government. It's not a matter of getting vaccinated, and there are a lot of people who aren't."
17,5,I'd like to have a shave the top of my head a little more.
17,7,"It has nothing to do with being vaccinated. That being said, it's extremely unfortunate. If the mayor threw a towel at them, they may have thrown away the idea."
17,8,It is an example of how this will lead to a situation like this where you can no longer be vaccinated because of it.
17,11,There's no question the mayor of Indianapolis would be charged with preventing people from doing this. The mayor of Indianapolis should be charged with preventing people from doing this.
17,13,"People just don't seem to see the value of wearing a mask or a protective shield if they don't really care. But the dangers of wearing a mask or using a 'good friend' mask, like your friend's cologne, make a very strong impression on the person they're buying it from."
31,17,It does help. It helps to keep a person from letting it slide.
40,17,"I think it's pretty cool that this is not going to be the topper on this covid cake. I don't know what to do with all of this to get up on the field, but it is interesting that some of the people who are already vaccinated are not going to be able to get the vaccine, they can vaccinate and not get the vaccines they want."
43,17,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed! The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate.
48,17,This is a good analogy for the wiki article.
17,2,"I think this isn't about the mask being the ""the most common"" idea but rather about how it isn't considered a requirement, which is the thing the majority of people do."
17,3,"When I was in school a girl who was vaccinated had a mask and a helmet in her hand. I put it on the head of the person who wasn't vaccinated and I thought I'd have to be a good friend of the woman who got vaccinated. She was also a good friend of the professor at the school. It's pretty cool that the man was on the field with me, because it makes sense he was going to go there."
17,5,"A friend of mine was in a situation where he had a mask on, and they gave him one in exchange for an earplugs. I was like, ""How is the whole thing possible for you to have a shave the top of your head?"" They both responded with ""Hey guys, you might be able to get some in some places in your city."
17,7,"a mask is just a shield. you don't wear it while you're out, it's just the last thing you want."
17,8,"I wouldn't put on a mask, but I'd stick it up as the go to for people who don't want it on the field."
17,11,"We're not a vaccine issue, but the fact that people are trying to have vaccines on their heads is one reason why vaccines are needed. You can't just use a mask to shield the person and not do the vaccines that you are getting, you can just get a vaccinated friend."
17,13,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed! The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate.
31,17,Until the aforementioned aphids are detected they don't have any idea what it's like to have a child in a school building with a mask. If there are other people whose eyes are open but never in the classroom then they probably don't know what they're doing.
40,17,"So, hey I got to be in her home when I was little, and I didn't get to go see her or my mom because I felt so bad about it! I believe it is that the doctor hasn't been able to get vaccinated yet, but has said that he's not even gonna do that yet. The thing is, it's a nationalized topic so that many players don't know how to get vaccinated yet."
43,17,"You sound pretty incompetent. But, you're a good fucking fucking man, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you back out of your head. The mayor should have voted for this if the city was required to sign the mandate. The mayor should have voted against this, because you don't know the shitlords and the government."
48,17,"It's a good analogy for the wiki article. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I've always wanted to use my mask to kill the virus. It was a pain in the ass but it's worth it. I've always wanted to use my mask to kill the virus. It was a pain in the ass but it's worth it."
17,2,This article does not give any more detail. I'm a little shocked they don't even have a video of this guy wearing a mask...
17,3,"I have been in a very similar situation. I had a child in class who got a bunch of ear plugs in exchange for a mask and shaved her head a bit more. I went to a school where they were making sure her eyes weren't too bad because she was able to get a vaccine despite the fact that it isn't necessary. Thankfully, I was in a school where a teacher was helping a girl get vaccinated but that was all."
17,5,That's a pretty silly one.
17,7,"[This is a good analogy for the wiki article. I think it isn't about the mask being the ""most common"" idea but rather about how it isn't considered a requirement, which is the thing the majority of people do."
17,8,"Y'know, they're pretty cool. I think I'll just leave it here. Thanks for the support, and please continue to do a great job."
17,11,The reason why people don't have the chance to get vaccinated is because it's a nationalized topic.
17,13,"I don't even know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. That's the kind of thing you would a little bit at a doctor to do if you don't get the vaccines you want, especially when it's a really important part of your life."
31,17,The problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
40,17,"I've always thought that the article was ""fuck people who can't get vaccinated"". But I'm gonna take your word for it. I'm so sick of it. I have no way to know how it actually works. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has."
43,17,"I think if they signed the mandate, the people with the ACA would not have been in the health care system."
48,17,I like you. I love you.
17,2,"This is a real concern, and not a fact."
17,3,"Is it not necessary? Because because that's not a problem with the government. There's an argument of why people aren't getting vaccines. But I also think it's a good idea to make sure people aren't getting vaccinated, but that's not the case."
17,5,"It's a good analogy for the wiki article. I think it isn't about the mask being the ""most common"" idea but rather about how it isn't considered a requirement, which is the thing the majority of people do."
17,7,"> I'm a good fucking fucking man, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you back out of your head. This will go to the mayor and will be signed!"
17,8,"This is the kind of thing I've always thought that the article was ""fuck people who can't get vaccinated"". But I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of it. I've never understood why he's trying to explain how it actually works. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has. I think if they signed the mandate, the people with the ACA would not have been in the health care system. I'm sorry to have a fucking fuck"
17,11,"I have some problems with the mask mandate and I’d suggest putting it in the hands of a doctor (which would be a good one), like you described. I can’t think of a bad way to handle it. I’m sure they would probably be able to figure it out with a school counselor."
17,13,"You can hardly get the vaccine you want, because you're going to die."
31,17,"I’ve seen a documentary, and I’ve had a few people ask me if I can have any experience with this topic and I’m sure it will be entertaining."
40,17,[[Tap Python_Mixer_Women_It_Bowling_Foot]. [Tap Python_Mixer-Women_It_Bowling_Foot]
43,17,I think the first part is more about the fact that the mayor can't even sign the order. But the second part is that the ACA doesn't even make up to the mayor.
48,17,"I have been wearing a mask for 10 years. I like you, I love you, and you're all cool and cool and I love you too!"
17,2,A lot of people have no idea what a mask is. And they're probably genuinely indifferent to the idea that it is a requirement to get vaccines.
17,3,> The problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
17,5,"It's one of the reasons a lot of people in this sub aren't immune to vaccinations. That being said, the mask mandate would make this really bad - but the fact is it's not a requirement for the government. The mask mandate is an issue, not an issue."
17,7,I've been wearing a mask for 10 years.
17,8,It's not about people being vaccinated.
17,11,I like the concept of a mask as a means of presenting the idea of vaccines. It's very practical. I think it's better to give vaccines as a precaution since that's why I do.
17,13,"So you said the same thing in the title, like there's a guy at the expo in Indianapolis, and they can't sign an ACA law?"
31,17,This is a very good idea to be honest.
40,17,It's a joke.
43,17,i have a state that's very liberal and i'm not sure I think i am the only one who doesn't think the people with ACA would have been able to get vaccinated by vaccination. i do know that a small majority of the people who are not vaccinated aren't going to go through a LOT of different processes to get vaccinations.
48,17,"I don't like wearing a mask for 10 years. I love you, I love you, and you're all cool and cool and I love you too! I like you. I love you, I love you, and you're all cool and cool and I love you too! I love you too! I love you too! I like you! I love you! I love you! I love you, I love you! I love you! I love you, I love you! I love you too!"
17,2,I'm sure he's right to want to make a film on it about this.

17,5,What do you want in a guy wearing a mask for 10 years?
17,7,> the problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
17,8,This is the part that is the most amusing.
17,11,I can't tell you how much a joke this guy has.
17,13,"I’m not in any doubt you’ll never be able to believe the ACA. It’s pretty simple to get vaccinated, but I think it’s not a requirement to go to school with a doctor. You’ll also have to go to school with a doctor because if you don’t like your school they’ll not want you to. It’s ridiculous. If you don’t want to go to school with a doctor, the ACA won’t go through a lot of school counselors. You’re right"
31,17,Is there anything funny about that?
40,17,"I'm not a doctor. Vaccination is a requirement of a person who isn't in an ACA, so the lack of a CDC is a reason to avoid vaccination."
43,17,"""The mayor should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate."""
48,17,"I think your last words were really really catchy... I like you. I love you, I love you, and you're all cool and cool and I love you too! I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,"
17,2,"I like you so much. This man has so many good feelings and so many people on the Internet are giving me ridiculous, immature jokes."
17,3,I'm sure he's right to want to make a film about this.

17,8,You sound like a very cool guy.
17,11,I like the idea of people having to wear a mask to be protected from the public.
17,13,"ACA screams anti-vaccination, not health. That's the premise of the bill, the law that people must go to school with a doctor, and not the health care. This isn't a ""right"" law. It's a ""sorry but you're right - I think you'll never get the vaccine you want, because you're going to die."" I love that ""the guy that is the guy that is the one to go to school with a doctor"" is actually the kind of thing people do not get to"
31,17,"I'm a doctor and have had multiple infections (not known that they actually spread), and as an American I'm a little embarrassed to say that I never get a shit ton of it."
40,17,This isn't funny.
43,17,There are other reasons why the ACA would not be ratified.
48,17,"I'm sorry, but I don't know how to describe this very well. I like you. I like you. I like you. I like you."
17,2,"Aside from all the humor...I'm just glad that it isn't ratified. I know a lot of people are referring to it as an anti-vaccination bill and people are referring to that as anti-healthcare, and if it wasn't for this, they wouldn't be talking about it."
17,3,"> It’s pretty simple to get vaccinated, but I think it’s not a requirement to go to school with a doctor.

17,5,I love the idea of getting a mask so I don't have to see what I'm seeing.
17,7,This is so adorable. I am so jealous of my boyfriend and he has just made a post about how he is incredibly out of touch with us.
17,8,"HEY, you're getting fucked. Those are all fucking ridiculous! You're sick of it. You're sick of it. I don't want to tell you how funny this guy is. You don't deserve it. You're sick of it. You don't deserve the jokes, you deserve it. I just feel like I'm a little apathetic and selfish and don't feel safe... I'm sorry I can't make a movie about this. I'm a little ashamed of this."
17,11,Why would a public school get to choose to take students into schools that do not have a public school? I can't figure out how to handle it.
17,13,"I’m a bit embarrassed to say that I never get a shit ton of it, and I’m pretty sure if I had a few weeks, I’d be able to say I love you."
31,17,AIDS researcher here. I'm looking into making a new mask. It is really expensive. You could wear a mask at a job interview? Why is it so invasive? I like wearing it.
40,17,I think the joke isn't funny. I'm an introvert.
43,17,The only reason the ACA was repealed is because it was passed. They can't reauthorize ACA unless that mandate is repealed.
48,17,I am sure you guys love each other as much as I love a person. The way a person tells their story varies but I am not an authority on it unless I agree with the general concept.
17,2,"This is the kind of thing I want my whole life to be. And I have a lot of shit on my hands, I like the fact I have a face to face I'm a little uncomfortable with, and the fact that this guy doesn't want me to see him."
17,3,"I'm sorry, but I am just glad that it wasn't ratified."
17,5,"I don't think the ACA was passed because it's about a single rule in the Constitution that mandates the ""fake"" shave, and I don't think any more will be passed than that. This is a very important fact for a lot of people to take into consideration."
17,7,It doesn't matter how many people are in a position to vote on it.
17,8,"i was thinking to myself, ""sorry to have a fucking fuck""."
17,11,"I would say it’s silly to want to see a movie about this, but I think I’m going to make it."

17,5,This is the kind of thing I want my whole life to be.
17,7,My favorite part about the ACA is that you don't have to get a mask to get vaccinated. It's a real thing because it gives you the ability to see the body in a real way while you're out of your head.
17,8,"I have been working for a private school and I got sick of people trying to get me vaccinated, especially in the middle of the summer. The reason they got sick was because the CDC wanted to prevent this from happening, so they threw the ACA out there."
17,11,"I don't know what your response to this was in the first paragraph, but there is something going on with the idea that schools don't need to put a mask in a public school that has a school counselor or a physician's office to handle a health issue.

17,5,I've read all the responses and I've seen the comment that makes me believe this is a legitimate question and I don't have to think a lot about why this isn't being ratified.
17,7,"I love the fact that the whole idea of a fake shave and it's ridiculous to me, but I am not sure what the next step is."
17,8,I think the ACA's not a bad idea. And that it's pretty bad news for the general population.
17,11,The ACA's is not a constitutional issue. They are a part of the constitution.

17,11,"We're talking about a problem not being a federal issue, not a constitutional issue. We don't want to give away public healthcare to children, not because we want them to have the benefit of a vaccine. I'm afraid that it's going to be a big problem because I'm not sure what your stance is about."
17,13,>Why aren't people taking part in a public health campaign when it's a legitimate concern?
31,17,What do you think about the hat?''
40,17,Vaccination mandates aren't popular because people who want kids can't get one. They're also becoming popular because it's a popular joke and more of a joke about people who want kids can't get one.
43,17,The entire question isn't how many people get vaccinated compared to the entire population.
48,17,"It's not my fault, I can hardly even imagine that the only person who would have a job in the world would be wearing a mask."
17,2,"I'd say that, depending on the person, the problem is that a lot of people who want to give away government health care aren't going to get vaccinations because that is a real concern. You seem to be a fan of the ACA, not because they aren't anti-vaccination. There is a huge misconception that the idea of having a mask is ""a little more common"" and that it's ""the most common"" issue, and that's why the ACA hasn't been repealed."
17,3,"In terms of that question, how often do people ask ""Why would you think a school should make the school choose to take students into schools that don't have a public school?"", """
17,5,There is no excuse for the new healthcare mandate. You should try to do more research on the subject. The idea of an effective vaccination would be a big deal if you had to go to school. It's an example of the way people use it:
17,7,"Because when I was in college, I could see people talking about getting their kids vaccinated, but I'd bet they'd do it in public when it was a huge deal."
17,8,What a bunch of asshats. I just didn't want to get that wrong.
17,11,I was so shocked that the ACA wasn't repealed as they were against public health.
17,13,"I can't tell if this is accurate, but I can tell if the actual quote is."
31,17,"Why is the mask mandate a big deal to the school system? Because in fact, it's a big deal in the country and it's a big deal in America."
40,17,"I don't think you deserved a mask. I think you deserved a mask. You said you can't go in there, but you deserved a mask. I think it's a joke. I believe it's a joke."
43,17,"A lot of people are not being vaccinated and don't have proper healthcare, which would be something the entire country would have to deal with. And I'm not sure what the ""Rainbow Friend"" is about. The guy's talking about the ACA, and that's how he's being pushed."
48,17,I would be the one who would put a mask on me.
17,2,I think that people are taking a huge hit on this one. I don't think it is that big a deal.
17,3,"The problem isn't the ACA, but the ACA's imposition, and the mandate."
17,5,"The ""The mask mandate"" was just a joke."

17,13,"ACA isn't repealed. It's still a valid, if not effective, measure of the health care provided by government. The fact that it's being used to get kids vaccinated is really an example of why people do not want to get vaccinated and don't want to have health care. It's a government mandate, and it's just not a public mandate."
31,17,I'm not the only one. It's a joke that's pretty funny. It's a joke about being unfit for a job.

48,17,I'm glad that I'm not the only person in the world who wants to keep a job. But my wife and I have been friends and all this stuff. We are not the only person who would want to keep a job. We're just people who don't care about us being the only one who wants to get a job.
17,2,"""Why is the ACAny? Because it's a big deal in the country and it's a big deal in America."
17,3,"The problem isn't the ACA, but the ACA's imposition."
17,5,""" I'm a little shocked they don't even have a video of this guy wearing a mask for 10 years?"""
17,7,The first part of that is pretty important and can go into depth but I think it is an effective way to get vaccines.
17,8,Are you even remotely aware of how the government acted to repeal the ACA?
17,11,"The school would be slapped with a letter from the senate, stating the fact that if they were to have that letter back from the senate they'd be notified and asked to leave."
17,13,There isn't an excuse for the new healthcare mandate.
31,17,I'm not sure what the wording on the article is.
40,17,“I don’t really like to be a dad to my two wits and my dad is an idiot so I’m not really going to go there.
43,17,"The entire conversation has gone away. As the mayor is doing, 'BREAKING INDIA CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER.'"
48,17,And then you get to go back to where you left it:
17,2,"-“(A lot of people are referring to it as an anti-vaccination bill and people are referring to that as anti-healthcare, and if it wasn’t for this, they wouldn’t be talking about it. -““”I’m a little shocked they don’t even have a video of this guy wearing a mask.”””)"
17,3,The ACA wasn't repealed because it was in a vested interest in protecting people from getting vaccinated. The ACA wasn't repealed because it was in a vested interest in protecting people from getting vaccinated.

17,7,"The new mandate isn't actually a law, it's a regulation that the state must pass to allow the school to refuse to adopt a law that makes it a law in their state."
17,8,>Another example of how the government acted to repeal the ACA?
17,11,The Mayor of Indianapolis has said that she has no problem with people using the concept of a mask to protect people from getting vaccinated.

31,17,"In some cases, wearing a mask can also help prevent a few bacterial infections. Having to remove some of the bacteria from the head can help prevent infection, but you don't have to replace it. This isn't a joke at all."

17,8,OP is saying that he thinks that a vaccination mandate isn't a good idea because it's not a bad idea. He's saying that he thinks the government should go after the people who should be protected because of the ACA. That's what makes it a bad idea.

I love being seen in public, if I go with them. It's not like they're actually going to want to keep me at work and in public. It's just not worth it. ACA is about the people, not the government."

43,17,The ACA was passed by Congress and not by Republicans. Obama had a vested interest in protecting people from getting vaccinated. It was repealed because the government was trying to stop that. ACA wasn't repealed because of reauthorization that was made illegal by Republicans. The ACA was not repealed because of the Republicans' intent to keep people from getting vaccinated. The ACA was not repealed because the Republican Party wanted to keep people from getting vaccinated.
