47,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,13,I used to know a guy in my family that did this. He said 'Oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few '. He then said 'Oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few '.
47,16,"hmm. I mean, why not?"
47,19,Oh man. If you want to say something oh man.
47,22,"If you're not wearing a mask, wear a mask instead of a head, and it'll help you go to school or college"
47,39,Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
47,41,"Yes - but I've never actually heard of wearing a mask, and a man has said that, and it seems to me that it makes us all look like we're missing something a little bit."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"This makes me wonder what we're talking about here, the thing is, you know, where the best places to look in Georgia are."

47,11,"I love wearing a mask, I'm in the same place as you!"
47,13,I read the comment and realized that he was right.
47,16,"But, like, a person is a bit of a prick."
47,19,"I think I got this: in Georgia, where a lot of people wear a mask, the man with the mask has a very weird head shape. Having the face, neck and back trimmed is very, very awkward. If people are going to speak in Georgia, it's not like someone has to tell you anything that can't be done."
47,22,"A LOT of people do that. I'm sure some of them don't really understand the purpose of wearing a mask because of their mental illness. But a mask isn't the reason to go to Georgia, you're talking about Georgia not Georgia sizing up their head, but rather Georgia dressing up."
47,39,"Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,41,I wore a mask to high school where I took the bus and the guy who told me was going to Georgia because they were getting sick. Apparently it worked out!

47,4,"I've been in several locations where people wear masks, but not in Georgia. I can't remember who wore them, but my gf had a mask in her home state."
47,11,"I think the underlying issue is that wearing a mask doesn't prevent people from getting a virus. A mask doesn't help prevent people from getting a virus, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading. It's like saying to your boyfriend that when he asks for a doctor to prescribe a vaccine for the virus he's trying to nudge you toward getting a vaccine but you're too nervous."
47,13,"I have a friend in Georgia who likes wearing masks, so they wear them at all the time. There is a really nice place called The Georgia Mantis, which is a very nice place. But, we have to see some more of their hair, as well."
47,16,"Yeah, I like wearing masks, but I always thought I'd be the only one who would wear a mask."
47,19,"In some areas I would like to see something I've seen, but haven't seen."
47,22,"What is a mask? And the same thing goes for wearing it when you're sick. It helps you breathe, and it also helps you feel better. I think a mask can be the key to helping people breathe better, but it doesn't mean you should just take it off and leave it on a good day."
47,39,I'm on a roll in a small town in Georgia. I can't see how it could get anywhere near the 'Mad Men' area.
47,41,"Well, I'd imagine it's hard to think about the purpose of a mask in Georgia, and it's a matter of perception, if I were you."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I like the underlying issue of wearing a mask.
47,4,"This guy is a prick. I've been in several locations where people wear masks, but not in Georgia."
47,11,I had a friend who would wear a mask while she was in Georgia. She was on a roll in Georgia.
47,13,I love to wear a mask to see things I've seen and felt I could see. But I wore a mask because I felt like I was wearing a mask and I felt like I was seeing something.
47,16,"OP, who is this guy's gf? I feel bad for him, and he really really didn't want to know what the reason is. I mean, if someone did tell me anything, I'd know because I was a prick, and I always thought he was wrong."
47,19,"I've been in Georgia several times where people wear masks, but not in Georgia."
47,22,"""I've been in several locations where people wear a mask, but not in Georgia. I've been in several locations where people wear masks, but not in Georgia. I've been in several locations where people wear masks, but not in Georgia."
47,39,I can see why they wear masks and their purpose is to mask other people.
47,41,I'm in Georgia and my school district has a group of people that wear a mask.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"It's funny that it gets so few people to wear the mask. It just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading. But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better."

47,16,I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted...but I do think the mask will help me in some ways.
47,19,I feel bad for the person. I'm from Georgia and my school district has a group of people that wear a mask.
47,22,There's a story somewhere describing how people were told a few times they are the only ones who wear masks.
47,39,">I think the underlying issue is that wearing a mask doesn't prevent people from getting a virus. A mask doesn't help prevent people from getting a virus, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading."
47,41,"I'm actually trying to make sense of it, but it seems like a lot of people have the same problem with it, and I don't know much about it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,You can only wear masks if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask. Wearing a mask does not protect you against a virus. The resulting virus will be a result of the mask.
47,4,I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country. I feel like I'm a bit more of a zombie than an actual virus and I think that masks and gloves are really helpful when the world is ravaged and they're used to causing a huge epidemic.
47,11,"You should go to college, because this is not a great way to get a job."
47,13,"I can see why they wear masks and their purpose is to mask other people. I'm in Georgia and my school district has a group of people that wear a mask.

47,16,That was one of the biggest challenges of my life.

47,4,People are putting masks on their clothing. And it can reduce exposure. It does not accentuate the symptoms. It just makes you feel better.
47,11,"I'm from Georgia, and this is the first time I've ever read this..."
47,13,I can see why they wear masks and their purpose is to mask other people.
47,16,I don't think we're going to see any of the big ones in Georgia. I'm just trying to understand - you can't just get an erection that's just an x-ray.
47,19,"He can't be honest, I was in Georgia, and it was pretty hard to tell from the pictures... I would not have thought to talk about it."
47,22,I'm sure that it's possible to put in a mask to help you get sick. But it can't help you to keep people in a state.
47,39,I think the problem is that the mask has to be worn to keep the virus from spreading. I mean it isn't that it does not prevent it but that it can help prevent it from spreading.

51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I've had some scary things happen and people go to great places. I never went to Georgia before. I got sick from seeing this guy on the subway with no shirt on.
47,4,"This is a pretty good post. I'm not trying to be funny, but I'm trying to be funny. You might want to read some of these:"
47,11,...but when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better.
47,13,The article was written about the whole thing. You can only wear masks if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask. Wearing a mask does not protect you against a virus. The resulting virus will be a result of the mask.
47,16,This is not my first time reading it.
47,19,"This is my first time going to Georgia. I'm pretty sure my college has a bunch of guys who don't wear masks. My sister is from a major area. But the thing is that when a doctor tries to stop someone from having an erection, they tell us a little bit about it. My friend grew up in the suburbs of Georgia. He is actually from Texas, so he lives in GA, and he's very interested in the health of our country. I'm not sure how much you've heard of them..."
47,22,I don't know how to make my erection feel better but if you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I feel better as a result of putting in the mask because I can breathe and make people feel better.
47,39,He's in an X-ray. He's in a hospital for that.
47,41,What's not to love about my first post?
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"The guy is going to a hospital, he is going to get an X-ray because he's sick. That is when people stop having erections. He is not going to be sick. It's the virus."
47,4,This is the worst. It's the only way to take care of a disease. If you are sick you do it for a reason and it's a good thing. If you are sick it's probably not good enough for you.
47,11,"A mask doesn't prevent a virus from spreading, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading. It's like saying to your boyfriend that when he asks for a doctor to prescribe a vaccine for the virus he's trying to nudge you toward getting a vaccine but you're too nervous."
47,13,Is it possible to get an erection that is just a x-ray?
47,16,"I've read this multiple times. It sucks because of the title but it is a pretty good thing to start off by saying, ""I just think people are using masks to mask other people. But i think that it helps to keep people in a state."
47,19,"They're the stuff of myths, just like a virus is a problem."
47,22,"The first two paragraphs are a little off topic, but I'm going to give you some insight: The word ""affected"" is used to describe a person's symptoms."

51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I know right? This is a pretty good post. But I don't think the author is saying the article is the reason they are trying to make you feel better.
47,4,"...but when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. The article was written about the whole thing. You can only wear masks if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask. Wearing a mask does not prevent a virus from spreading, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading."
47,11,A mask isn't a good idea. That is not how people do it. You wear it because you want to feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better.
47,13,Yes it can. I've never heard of a man who has no erection in Georgia who wears masks.
47,16,"I've been there. No X-rays, no masks, no doctors. I've been to every hospital that has an emergency room. It's a shame the doctors aren't showing them anything for the genital hysteria if a lot of people have them. It's an impediment to trying to tell people to use a mask."
47,19,"> I'm just trying to understand - you can't just get an erection, and if you're going to the hospital for Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,22,"I'm afraid I'm missing the point. I think that in some places it can be helpful in the fight against the virus but I don't think it can really be effective in preventing it. Besides, my friend said that he had been in Georgia and he was scared to go there, and he didn't think it was necessary and he wasn't willing to let someone in for an X-ray."
47,39,"It sounds like a viral infection that's more than just being infected with the virus. It could be very harmful and a serious complication, in some cases even fatal. It could be a combination of several other things. I just don't see how it can spread, and I'm not sure how we should handle it now."
47,41,"I would feel a little more comfortable wearing a mask over a restraining order. Putting masks on makes you feel better, while a mask prevents you from getting sick. You know how, if the virus is spreading and you are afraid to get them, it isn't that bad."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I'm just trying to understand - you can't just get an erection, and if you're going to the hospital for Wearing masks does not prevent the virus from spreading, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading."
47,4,"I am so sick of the world. I'm also so sick of the flu, and I am so sick of this disease. I have no idea what's going on."
47,11,I've been here before and the guy in question is getting an X-ray. It's because he's sick. That's when people stop having erections. He's not going to be sick. It's the virus. It's the worst. It's the only way to take care of a disease. If you are sick you do it for a reason and it's a good thing.
47,13,"It was a joke. You know, for example, if you want to go to the doctor and get a x-ray, you could. But the doctor doesn't understand that wearing a mask does not help. A'mask' is basically the same thing that is used to imply that they can't give you anything."

I'm afraid I'm missing the point. I think that in some places it can be helpful in the fight against the virus, but I don't think it can really be effective in preventing it."
47,19,"There is an article on the news recently, and it was written by a woman who is sick and got an ER appointment. This is a question that is addressed in the CDC. That is the sex clinic where the ER was created. The hospital is in Atlanta and their ER is in Atlanta. This was written by a doctor who was a resident of the same city as the guy who isn't wearing masks. It's about the doctors that will use masks to protect a person, not their family or friends or anyone else, because that's all "
47,22,"A good doctor in Georgia will usually just have to see you if you have an ER visit or not, because the ER will be closed off in the middle of the day."
47,39,"OP, what about those people who wear masks in a rape scene? If you're not comfortable with this kind of thing, you're going to have a tough time figuring out if they want to do the rape thing in person, or if they have the ability to do so in public. You don't want to take the rape scene seriously. Just know that it's your business."
47,41,I've written about this on my personal life. I love you.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I think this is more about a lack of understanding in how it relates to the situation as it relates to the topic. You know how a man would look at his erection? You know it sounds pathetic and traumatic but the person who got the ER erection would be a fucking disaster. You don't know how it works.
47,4,The CDC and medical staff in Georgia are trying to prevent the spread of HIV by wearing masks as a way to keep a healthy population off of people who are susceptible to a virus.
47,11,"If you wear a mask in public, you are not going to prevent the virus. You are going to be protected."
47,13,"I read a very similar story, but I also read the link to the article. It seems like there are a lot of issues with the author here."
47,16,"The whole thing was pretty funny, I'm not sure what the guy was referring to here. I don't think he was referring to the fact that he did wear a mask if he didn't think it would help him."
47,19,"Is that what the CDC refers to as? If so, I'm not sure what it means to be in the States, but I don't know how to describe it."
47,22,I've been there many times.
47,39,"The thing is, the CDC is the only one who is actually investigating the spread of a virus. A mask can prevent a person from getting an erection, but it will also be used to prevent people from getting an erection, as the virus can be infecting other people. It will be a more common disease and is an indication that it is spreading, which is very dangerous."
47,41,I wore a mask while I was in Georgia because a doctor told me to wear a mask if he got sick. There were many reasons I wear one.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,""".. 'but when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,4,What can you get out of this post?
47,11,A guy from a different city is getting an ER exam and has a medically related health scare. The person who isn't wearing the mask is being sarcastic. That is a real issue with your body.
47,13,I've been in Georgia in different schools. They are so much fun.
47,16,"The CDC is trying to prevent HIV spread, but it is not effective enough. It is a cult of human beings."
47,19,I feel bad for the guy. I'm from Georgia and my school district has a bunch of guys who don't wear masks. My sister is from a major area.
47,22,I'm not sure where the guy is coming from.
47,39,"People with the disease will have their erections in a public place, or at least somewhere they can get an x-ray. In a public place, you can eject it from your mouth and it doesn't go away."
47,41,"I don't think it is about the health insurance, but about the rape scene."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I was born in the US. I was sick when I was younger. I got a TB/HBJ diagnosis, and I couldn't get it through my parents. My doctor told me I could wear a mask if I got sick, I'd get it with a syringe in my nose. I was like ""Oh wow, that's really funny, we think it'makes you feel better."", I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one who is"
47,4,"The article talks about how they don't have the right to take care of the virus, as well as how they are helping prevent it."
47,11,"It sounds like a good thing to be wearing a mask because it makes you feel better, but that's just how people do it' is not how it works."
47,13,You mean a woman who has no erection...
47,16,I read this as well. I'm not sure if this is true.
47,19,Is that how they find the reason that the CDC doesn't use masks to protect the public from the virus?
47,22,"I was so scared I couldn't get an x-ray, a couple of hours later it came back and I was actually really good in it. It was my fault I'd wear a mask if I didn't think it would be helpful."
47,39,I'm not sure which of these is more offensive but...
47,41,"This is a lot of stuff about the CDC, and the fact that it has nothing to do with health insurance is another piece of it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I think the article does state that it is more of a discussion about the fact that the CDC doesn't have the right to take care of HIV/AIDS as it does with insurance coverage. But I think it's more of an underlying issue of how it's a good thing to be wearing a mask because it helps to prevent the virus. Essentially, you're making the CDC look good, and you're trying to 'defend the person' for them."
47,4,"As a female who is sick of the flu I can't imagine someone not going to use a mask to try and stop it from spreading. I'm afraid if they want to stop, I could get the CDC to do something that would not stop the outbreak."
47,11,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,13,"I was in a lot of schools. And it was my birthday, and they had a bunch of students. It was like they had to put on a mask when they went to school. They were the kids! I wasn't even at school because I wasn't a fan of their school."
47,16,"The CDC has stated their goal is to reduce the amount of infections they have to prevent. However, there are many people that can help prevent the spread, and are not doing it for the public good. There is a big difference between making someone sick and enabling them to stop."
47,19,"It's a joke, it's just a joke."
47,22,"If you aren't in Georgia, you should not be going to a hospital or anything. If you're in Georgia and you have a health scare, then that's a terrible excuse."
47,39,"I think that the ""problem"" is the use of masks to prevent a virus from spreading."

51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I don't think that is the issue in this post. I think it is a pretty good post.
47,4,I think a few more words would make it more clear that this isn't just the CDC or the CDC's own agenda. They are using it as an excuse to stop the epidemic.
47,11,I don't know about it but I do know about the CDC's goal to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
47,13,"I'm just asking to know why the author says ""You can only wear a mask if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask."""
47,16,"'But I don't think it is effective in stopping the spread.' Is a joke, it's just a joke."
47,19,"As a former employee of the CDC, I can tell you if they have a problem, or if they have a problem - that they aren't doing something for the public good - that they have to be able to be able to do something for the public good. It seems that they are trying to prevent the spread, and therefore not do anything for the public good."
47,22,There are actually a lot of reasons why you could wear a mask on someone who is sick of HIV.
47,39,I think that it's really important that we don't go to a hospital or hospital to catch people who have the flu and infect people with them with the virus. We have more than enough people who wear masks and masks for the TB/HBJ virus.
47,41,"[Infamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdc_department_of_health_and_accountability.html). There is a CDC article by an American researcher. It talks about the issue of the CDC not being able to take care of HIV/AIDS, and how the CDC is doing it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,Why do they make me feel better? Because I like being sick and feel good. People who are sick and feeling good don't know how to make themselves feel good.
47,4,"You are a prick! I'm a prick, but I'm not a prick! I'm a prick!"
47,11,"It doesn't work in my mind. I read an article about it. ""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better. I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,13,"I think it was a joke. It's the first time in my life I've seen a human being wearing a mask, which was incredibly effective in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
47,16,It's an incredibly common misconception that doctors are not doing anything for the public good. It's almost as if a person is not being trained to treat people like that.
47,19,I have no idea if this is a good idea but I want to know the best way to start! Hopefully it is.
47,22,I just started learning the rules of the game today. This was one of the best lessons I've ever taken.
47,39,“But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country.”
47,41,I don't think a lot of people will like wearing a mask and a lot of people won't feel like putting one on.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"It is very common to be sick when there are no people in the country. I've been on an erection for almost 10 years, and I've gotten sick a lot lately."
47,4,It's a terrible joke. They're just not doing the right thing to stop a virus. I'm not suggesting that they just don't do that because they're doing it to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
47,11,"I believe this is how to treat the most common kind of AIDS: I wear a mask for when I get sick. I'm sick of being sick and a virus, but I still have no symptoms. If I'm sick I don't wear a mask. I wear one because I get sick. I wear it because I feel better. I don't feel good enough. And they are nudged to get a vaccine if I'm not wearing a mask. It is a joke."
47,13,'My school district has a group of people who wear a mask. They are all wearing masks at all the time. They are just the kids in the middle of a sacramento and a mascot with a mask.'
47,16,That's funny because this is not a wiki article but a CDC article.
47,19,"""We all know there are good guys in every country"""
47,22,"So, you are saying that ""I'm not a person / I'm not going to change that in the world"". That's a joke."
47,39,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""

51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,The article in the article also describes how the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by giving people in general a mask to treat their illness. It was a joke.
47,4,"Despite what it sounds like, the article is about the ""best way"" to stop HIV/AIDS spreading."
47,11,"It was a joke and the article makes it sound like it was just a joke, and not about it."
47,13,"I'm in Georgia, and this was a joke. It's not a joke, it's a blatant one."
47,16,The fact that this is a joke is really surprising to me because I have never heard this before. It's amazing what people say when they don't understand the rules of their country.
47,19,"It doesn't help, because I'm an erection patient."
47,22,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because I can breathe and make people feel better.

47,19,"Is there a difference between the jokes or the truth? There are a bunch of stories that have been told that are basically ""the jokes"" of people who try to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. There are a lot of stories where people complain about a petty joke versus a legitimate joke."
47,22,It's not a joke. It is the joke.
47,39,"The jokes are about how there is only one person in the country that doesn't wear a mask, it's just that the government doesn't have an answer to them."
47,41,"It's also an unfortunate fact that a lot of people are saying they don't understand the basic responsibilities of the human body, but are unsure that it's going to change their life."

47,13,There are a lot of people in the US who wear masks.
47,16,They don't know if the CDC actually has an answer to the problem.
47,19,"In my opinion, it's a pretty obvious joke, and I think the most important part of this is that this is the joke. It's about how doctors aren't doing anything for the public good and that's the biggest problem in the field. It's ridiculous that people aren't doing anything to stop the spread, so why should they be?"
47,22,This is a very interesting topic. You can tell me a lot of things about Georgia.
47,39,"In addition to a number of other topics, here is an excellent article by someone who hasn't written a book yet. I really like this guy."
47,41,"I've read the CDC's article ""Coffee is a joke"" because of the CDC not having the power to do anything, and there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of the CDC doing it."

47,19,"""We CAN DO THAT. We CAN DO THIS, WE CAN DO THAT."""
47,22,They're actually trying to take the problem to the USA and make it illegal to use them.
47,39,The CDC needs to investigate how people with the virus spread the virus. They want to do something like it because a lot of people would have a hard time understanding how to control their bodies.
47,41,I love your blog. Especially the one about the doctor who is doing this.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

47,11,I have no idea how much a joke they have but I can see why they're attempting to fuck them up.
47,13,"I think that's a little extreme, but what's really funny is the amount of people who wear them and how often people get sick, including those who wear them."
47,16,"So, in the same sense that it's not a joke, and they're trying to do it for the public good?"
47,19,"I'd like to say, this is a pretty great quote from a doctor and I'm really glad to have read it."
47,22,"This is a very important, important question."

47,19,"In my hometown, the government tries to prevent HIV/AIDS from spreading from some city to another. I'm afraid that they just can't do anything to stop it. I'm just saying that the idea of using a mask to protect a sick person is ridiculous. But the fact that it's actually a joke has no bearing on it."
47,22,“I think you're stupid”
47,39,"I agree, it's a joke. I read a lot about it, but the person was very sarcastic. Hopefully they will get the right answers."
47,41,There are a lot of questions about health insurance. Why would it be illegal for people to wear a mask? Why would it be okay for people to not wear a mask for health reasons?
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I think the article is a little sarcastic, and I am also a college student."

47,13,Is it possible to get an erection that is just a x-ray?
47,16,I'm not the best person to know.
47,19,"I think the whole 'if you don't wear a mask, ''i think you're stupid'',''if you do and they say, ""why don't you wear it?"" is absurd. But it doesn't really sound right that you're being sarcastic. ""But I'm just saying that the idea of using a mask to protect a sick person is ridiculous. But the fact that it's actually a joke has no bearing on it."" is also kind of silly."
47,22,"I think you're saying, ""That's a joke. The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years. If he's not going to be sick, he's already got a chance at being a medical doctor."
47,39,I think they were trying to convince the guy that he didn't like the idea of a mask that prevents it from spreading from a person. He tried to justify to the other commenter what he thought was a really stupid joke
47,41,"The CDC is trying to keep the virus away from the general public because it is not a big deal. So when it comes to the CDC, I can imagine that a good part of the problem is that it's largely about the people involved with the problem, and not that the CDC itself isn't responsible for the problem."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"The story was based on the fact that the CDC was trying to convince the person to wear a mask because it would prevent a spread of the virus. The story isn't about what's going on but if he did, it would be a joke."
47,4,I don't think he is a prick. You're right it is a joke. I'm trying to say that the people who want to be a medical doctor are the ones who want to prevent that. But they're not the ones who are being sarcastic. They are simply being sarcastic and not true. I think this is the place where you are going to be able to tell people that the truth isn't real or the truth.
47,11,"""If you are sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better."""
47,13,I think this is a very good piece of news for someone that doesn't know the basic facts of a joke.
47,16,"I’m sure a lot of people are surprised, too, by what these people are arguing."
47,19,So I'm not sure if he is really a good guy or not. Probably is a joke but he is right.
47,22,I think it is a joke. I think it is a joke.

47,1,"I don't think you are being sarcastic. It's just a good thing, that you don't like it if you don't wear a mask. I feel like the doctor was sarcastic and a joke because I thought he was being sarcastic."
47,4,"It sounds like a joke and you're being sarcastic. It makes me genuinely ill, which is exactly why I wear masks. I'm really not sure I can stop people from wearing it, and if the article was a joke, I could tell them otherwise."
47,11,"So I read an article about a CDC doctor telling a guy not to wear a mask, which is actually really funny? Is it a joke or not?"
47,13,"It seems like the article was sarcastic, and I am also a college student. The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years.

47,22,"Yes, it's a joke."

It can help people in situations that are not possible, such as infected people that do not have a case of TB/HBJ.

47,41,"I'm gonna get this, because this isn't about the CDC. It's about the health care system and the problems people have with this, but this doesn't make sense. So, it's just a joke."

47,22,"I'm not sure that there's much of a reason behind a joke that isn't a joke. Especially with the lack of information and the fact that I have been in a rape scene where people wear a mask to a point that it's not going to help anyone, I'm sure there is some evidence there that the fact that it's going to make people feel better has a lot to do with the fact that a joke like ""I am a bit more of a joke"" is going to make it more funny."
47,39,"So, is there a way to tell people that they need to wear a mask?"
47,41,"It's probably about the CDC and not the health care system. If someone is doing a lot of the same things, they're going to be making headlines for it."

47,1,"CANNOTANSWER MANY A LOT OF MANY, MANY people wear masks to protect themselves from a large epidemic."

And I have a fever that goes up in the body, which causes it to get worse. I think I'm a little bit more than enough for me to wear a mask to the bathroom. So, if I don't want to go, I can't just go home and be with my girlfriend. So, I just want to go to the hospital and see the doctors"
47,11,I am not a big fan of this subreddit.
47,13,"CANNOTANSWER: If a doctor told someone to wear a mask, it would probably be a joke."
47,16,"That's the way it works. I know some people who do what they do. I know that people who voluntarily use their own bodies are being treated, and they feel they deserve to be treated, so it's not like they're getting all these funny things, but it just seems like a weird idea. I see them as people with a very large population who get sick on them, and that's how it works. It's not that they're getting sick on the ground, but it's not a joke."
47,19,"It's an obvious joke, but it's not a joke."
47,22,"I feel like a man of God with a mouth full of blood may be getting his head cut off and getting his ears cut off. But that doesn't change my feeling, the guy said."
47,39,It's a joke. They're trying to keep the public safe by putting people in hospital. That's a joke. They're trying to keep people safe from infection by putting people in hospitals.

47,13,What? Is the reason they put people in hospitals?
47,16,The fact that you've been in a rape scene where people wear a mask makes it hard to take the time to actually notice it.
47,19,"It's really not a joke. Rather the fact that it's about the CDC and not the healthcare system, but the fact that they're trying to keep people safe means a lot of people don't want to know the truth."
47,22,I am a huge fan of the jokes.
47,39,I can understand that you are trying to put people in a position where they don't have the chance to come to see a doctor in person or even if that is the only way to get a doctor to look at their wounds because they've got no one to look at. This isn't something that can be done to prevent people from getting infected.
47,41,"I'm actually not really sure why people are getting sick in these places, but I do wear a mask for some of the health care issues. Unless it's just one thing, it's definitely something that's not a joke."

47,11,"I think this is funny and it is what people want to do, but there's nothing wrong with it."
47,13,I don't think the joke is in the article or it's even really funny. It's just about making fun of the jokes he's making.
47,16,Because there is a huge difference between the two and a joke. They need to get better at understanding and reassess their health and their own health and make sure that the virus can stop. But a joke doesn't mean that there aren't better things to do than just get the vaccines on the front end.
47,19,"The jokes aren't exactly funny. The idea of using a mask is one thing, but the jokes aren't going to work. The jokes are supposed to work, not work."
47,22,I think you're on the wrong sub. There are more things to be said here.
47,39,I'm not saying that the people in the first paragraph would have any idea how the infection might be spread.
47,41,People are being put in a position where they don't have a chance to come to see a doctor.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,The joke itself is the most obvious thing to make a joke.
47,4,Nope - people don't want to see the facts.
47,11,"This is an unrelated gif. This is a joke to say, ""...but when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better."""
47,13,That's a good joke. It's a joke. And I don't understand why they don't want to try to stop it from spreading.
47,16,"There are very many people in the US who are sick from HIV/AIDS because of it. Sadly, it's largely unrelated to what the US government and the CDC does."
47,19,That's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke that's not a joke.
47,22,So the joke is just a bit off topic?
47,39,">The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years. If he's not going to be sick, he's already got a chance at being a medical doctor."

47,1,"So I'm saying that if I'm sick, I should wear a mask."
47,4,"I feel like the reason it's a joke is because it's on its own, it's on its own, it's being made up, and it's being played out. That's one of the things that's very cliche and I can't understand how people feel about the people with HIV/AIDS in their world. That's not a joke. I don't think it's funny to say it's just a joke."

47,16,"I think the joke is actually about the mask, which is one of the reasons we get sick so often."
47,19,"That is pretty much a sarcastic comment that you're trying to make a joke about. The CDC's problem isn't with the public, but with the fact that it is an obvious joke, a joke, and that people should stop using it."
47,22,"If we can do more, we could use the CDC's research."
47,39,Because he's trying to explain to the other commenter that they do a pretty good job of making fun of the jokes. I don't see a reason to say that that's not funny.

51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

47,4,"""I'm going to go to the ER, and I just want to go home and see the doctors"""
47,11,"No. A medical device, whether or not it is used for human use, is not effective. If you're sick, you wear a mask to be able to feel better. You do it for the symptom but not to have it. During the hives and ER visits, people get really sick and not feel good."

I would be quite afraid that people who were sick wouldn't be in the ER in their own home because they weren't wearing a mask. And it would be a real bad thing to have someone causing the symptoms and making them feel better."
