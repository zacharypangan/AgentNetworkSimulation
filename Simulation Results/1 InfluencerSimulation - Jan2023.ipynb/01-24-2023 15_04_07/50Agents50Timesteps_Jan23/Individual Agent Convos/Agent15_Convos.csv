16,15,passes are solddd outtt but you can still pay at the door mask required
25,15,i was downtown dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame
30,15,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable
34,15,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
36,15,wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym
37,15,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
40,15,woman come on guys says you gotta wear a mask to go in there woman if you re not vaccinated woman exactly woman s daughter my momma says she s naturally vaccinated
41,15,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
45,15,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,As a person who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help.
15,3,What if you're just a few weeks old and it is the same person?
15,7,"As someone who has been vaccinated, you are just making me feel dumb. I mean, you're so fucking stupid, do you even know what the fuck that means? I can wear a mask for no reason whatsoever."

15,12,"As someone who grew up in Texas, I was surprised to see that we can still use a mask in some areas. It was nice being vaccinated and if you don't have it yet in California, you have to go in and buy a mask for a mask in order to get it."
16,15,"But if you wear your mask to protect yourself you'll get sick, if you're not paying at the door you will still get sick, and if you don't go to the door you'll die if you don't pay at the door"
25,15,"The people with masks in our country will be very bad at something, so you are going to need a helmet or a new mask ad in all those kids in ohio..."
30,15,"A lot of people are vaccinated, but this is a good one."
34,15,...and i have a dream of being in an open air theater and i am not afraid of my future.
36,15,Exactly the same thing happened to me after I tried to wear a mask last year... I felt a bit better.
37,15,"The woman is clearly vaccinated by the law, and wearing a mask to protect herself against the aphids is the prevailing method of treatment."
40,15,"It's like you're gonna die if you're not vaccinated to go in there, so you need a mask and a mask."
41,15,That s a great question. I like to think we should do some sort of 'topper' on our cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
45,15,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"You can wear a mask to protect yourself against aphids, that's the best treatment for you. You need a helmet and a mask, because you are not obligated to protect yourself."
15,3,"I can't even explain to you what a mask will be, if it's a mask you wear?"
15,7,The only reason to wear a mask is because it is not actually an actual medicine - you cannot have a mask or a face mask. That doesn't mean they have to be vaccinated.
15,10,"I think you're a little biased as I said I'm not a huge fan of the bill but in this case, I want to thank you for your words."
15,12,I’d like to think that we can have some sort of medical service that can provide vaccination and the ability to wear a mask to protect you and your family from the disease. I can see why this would help - if they actually wanted to.
16,15,"People who wear masks to protect themselves are going to die, not just from getting sick. They also will die to the same person if they are too sick to pay at the door. So the problem is they don't buy a ticket, the cost of one will increase."
25,15,He's a total moron and gitmo would be a good place for him to move to Ohio.
30,15,They are the best vaccines ever. I don't understand the hype around it. It's a huge pain and it's a shame for your skin. I don't think they should put a mask on your face for all time. It's like going into the bathroom and the skin starts burning out.
34,15,i was just trying to say this. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
36,15,"I hate how it has been so long since I was a football coach to the point that it's actually not fun to do the ""Mask"" part. The joke isn't a bit funny at all."

45,15,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,They don't need masks. They need them.
15,3,Is a mask a mask or just a mask? What the fuck is the other guy wearing?
15,7,...and i have a dream of being in an open air theater and i am not afraid of my future.
15,10,"""...and i have a dream of being in an open air theater and i am not afraid of my future."
15,12,This sounds like the one thing that could happen at the next generation's birthday party:
16,15,"OP said ""but if you wear your mask to protect yourself you'll get sick, if you're not paying at the door you will still get sick, and if you don't go to the door you'll die if you don't pay at the door."""
25,15,"I hate getting sick in the sun, but a mask does not hurt. It's a mask that helps with the cold and the cold."
30,15,"It seems a fucking lot to be the case. When I first got it, I didn't know there was a way to get it under my helmet. That isn't really how I figured it out. I thought it was just as annoying and so I've since had to be pretty sure I have an allergy. I didn't know there was anything else I could do besides to go for a run. I'm just glad I was vaccinated."
34,15,Is the bomber really going to get it? Typically the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. You have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask or
36,15,"It sounds like some sort of fetish, the way people talk about the mask and how it helps protect themselves. I can understand how you feel a little bit better. I can't imagine what you'd feel without it. It sounds like there's no way you'd feel comfortable, and even if it were, you'd still be able to feel a little better, but if you really needed to feel better, and the mask you're wearing is a good place to be to avoid the face / face and be comfortable, then maybe you'"
37,15,"I think you have a funny point that someone that isn't in it already knows. Rather than saying ""fuck you I'll be on top of it, let me know"" it's going to sound like this: ""Mask-mouse repair-electronic-repair-electronic-repair-electronic-repair"""
40,15,">I just like to think that I've heard of the new ""Age of Immunization"" campaign."
41,15,"That's pretty sad, but I was in school to help some kids to start wearing the mask for the first time. We would ask each other to bring it up and he would tell us something we needed to know for ourselves and our kids and not let it get in the way. There's a lot of pressure on us, and I thought the one question that popped up would be, ""Can we afford a helmet for my kids"" and it sounded like it'd be nice if it was lifted, but you could put your foot down and let your little finger down there and say"
45,15,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"In a similar vein, the guy who told me ""I want a mask because I've never been in public and my friends have told me they don't want to wear them."" That is an example of not liking the idea of a mask, because it's inherently a fetish to people who would rather wear one."
15,3,"> ""But if you wear your mask to protect yourself you'll get sick, if you're not paying at the door you will still get sick, and if you don't go to the door you'll die if you don't pay at the door."""
15,7,This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
15,10,"It seems like a lot of people are saying this about 'protecting your life', which I doubt you'll agree to if you're not aware of. I'd say the first thing that would come to mind in this case is a lack of a basic understanding of what that is."

16,15,You have no idea why this was posted.
25,15,"Despite the blunder and the troll he did, the guy who isn't in favor of vaccines seems to be the best place for him to move to Ohio."
30,15,"I'm gonna say it again, I'm a little young. And they're saying: they shouldn't make it mandatory that every woman in the world can get the vaccine, because women aren't responsible for their own health. ""Why do people keep asking this? What is a virus?"""
34,15,It's an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. I feel like this is an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. People shouldn't have to put up with things like that unless they absolutely have to.
36,15,"I think that you're thinking of a bunch of naive people saying I'm just a bit of a fan. You said you were not comfortable with wearing a mask and this is what I was thinking about. It's all just fucking annoying because you get the message from a helmet-wearing person, who is not comfortable wearing it in a helmet. You don't look smarter than you are because you are not confident in your appearance. You look so young when you're playing and the mask doesn't fit your lifestyle."
37,15,"OP......because it doesn't work. Yes, it's a nonsense and a terrible idea, I don't know why people are so pissed about that."
40,15,"I love how you put the ""I want the op"" in that sentence, but it makes me chuckle..."
41,15,"You guys need to work on your own helmets. In my city, a helmet is required to cover up a facial wound. This can be hard for a school. I'd go to a doctor's office to wear a naive mask on your naive chin. I'd be uncomfortable if they said that's the case but it's probably too much to ask."
45,15,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,2,"As someone who lives in Texas, I can honestly say that the situation is a little bit crazy, not to mention a lot of people who want to put their fucking face in a hat."
15,3,This is so crazy you should see a doctor for it.
15,7,Generally the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. You have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask or this
15,10,"If I'm not mistaken - and we're all not ok with it - the question is, do you know a lawyer who is working on a bill that says that the government should not use a mask? Because that's what they do."

16,15,I don't think that it's the problem they were trying to solve. They're trying to rewrite this stupid and stupid bill.
25,15,"You said you don't have a reason to live in the USA? I mean you don't have to be in the US to live in the US. I don't know why you were not in the USA, but why is your face as hot and hot as anyone's face? Because why is your face cold? That is not something you can go to your parents for."
30,15,"I can't stand being told by a doctor to get a medical diagnosis because I hate the thought that my skin can't breathe. I can't stand the thought of having to put on a mask if my face is hot or hurting. Then, I see what you are getting at :"

40,15,I think the answer is if you don't have a mother who can get vaccinated (and you're still paying for it) you will be at risk of death and you'll have to pay a lot of money to get the vaccine.
