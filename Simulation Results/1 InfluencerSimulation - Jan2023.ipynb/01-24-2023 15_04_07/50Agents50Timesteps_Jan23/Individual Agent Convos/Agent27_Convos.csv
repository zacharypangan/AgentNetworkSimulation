27,2,"The fact that the ACA was repealed is one of the reasons that the president seems to be a very, very hatless maniac."
27,7,a hat trick is a joke that the government is supposed to get all the health care on the ice before a law can be enacted. 'They aren't allowed to get a medical order unless they are signed. They are still required to get a medical order before the state can repeal the ACA.'
