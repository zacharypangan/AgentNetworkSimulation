34,29,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
36,29,wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym
41,29,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
42,29,why do people keep asking this yes i ve had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,That would be a bad fit with this state i think. I don't see it happening.
29,6,This sounds like a really interesting subject.
29,8,"What do you mean by ""this guy is garbage and utah needs to get rid of him gitmo would be a good place for him gop sen mitt romney votes with democrats to keep masks mandate for toddlers this guy is garbage and utah needs to get rid of him gitmo would be a good place for him """
29,11,You think your health care system needs to change and the mask mandate isn't a good place for it?
29,13,oh wow he's not a democrat
29,23,"I don't see why the mask mandate isn't lifted and a few weeks away for most of us why do people keep asking this yes i have had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,24,This is the only place I can think of for people to be against Obamacare unless the health department is in full swing with it.
29,25,The guy who isn't in favor of vaccines seems to be the best place for him to move to Ohio.
29,28,You are being very blunt. This is where I was. The GOP needs to be back in the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with.
34,29,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force

42,29,What? Why do people keep asking this? What is a virus?
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,"This is how it works. A Democrat can be the bad guy. The health care system is supposed to do better. They're supposed to be bad. They're supposed to be good, too."
29,6,"There are no real alternatives to getting vaccinations. You're being blunt. What is a virus? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. That would be a bad fit with this state i think."
29,8,"The GOP is in a bad position if it has not put people in a better position to protect themselves. It would only make people less interested in it, and that's it."
29,11,"You would essentially need to tell your wife, ""I m not against masks mandates unless they are lifted""."
29,13,I feel like there is a lot of talk about Obamacare being a good place for the GOP.
29,23,It's not like he's saying that he has no idea why he's not on the bill.
29,24,"I hate it. The way people are saying it isn't okay that it's being lifted, and this is why the health care system is still rabid."
29,25,"Despite his campaign promises, the Obamacare plan isn't what it should be. But the guy who isn't in favor of vaccines seems to be the best place for him to move to Ohio."
29,28,You can't have a healthy relationship with the government. That's an unhealthy relationship.
34,29,This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
36,29,'Wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym'
41,29,I think you missed the part about putting your name on a cake when the mask mandate isn't lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn't lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn't lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn't lifted
42,29,Because it's not really a virus and it doesn't help prevent any other infection. It is an inflammatory and infected disease that can be spread to anyone.
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,It's a pretty good thing that Obamacare doesn't give kids a vaccine and no one has to use it when they're sick.
29,6,It's a very strange and well known fact that vaccinations are currently banned by Obamacare for every patient in the United States. People who have had them for years say it is a disease and that it is a way of getting infected. It is not an anti-virus but it is very powerful. You need to take that into account and use that as a warning.
29,8,You are being very blunt. This is where I was. The GOP needs to be back in the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with.
29,11,"So you're a man? Having an argument about the mask mandate, I don't see the problem, but I can say that I agree with him. That's what he's being like."
29,13,"You're a racist, right? Because, after all, you are a racist. I don't like how you are being blunt, and that's not what I am trying to say, but I think it's a little funny that a lot of people are attempting to justify that."
29,23,The idea of having a public healthcare system isn't just a virus. It's a virus. Vaccinations are a vaccine.
29,24,> You are being very blunt. This is where I was. The GOP needs to be back in the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with. Honestly it's not worth bothering with. Honestly it's not worth bothering with.

29,28,Because the government isn't going to let you live where you want and have your health care.
34,29,"In addition to the video, the video also states that the bomber will not be able to pick up a hammer, or a pistol, or a shield, or a full-body mask, or a hammer, or a full-body mask."
36,29,i'm not sure if anyone else here is in a position to be that naive. I think that you're probably right that people are pissed because they didn't really realize that it was something that happened to them when they got their first helmet.

45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,"Its not the government's job to provide health care in the US, it is a federal regulation. There is not even a state government that offers that service in the US, and most of the states they serve doesn't do so. That is not the job of the state. You are being very naive. And you can't have a healthy relationship with the government. That's an unhealthy relationship. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."
29,6,I would love for the gov to do something about it if they would have an alternative to the mask mandate. I'm glad you didn't think I was racist. It is a bit of a cliche to say you're racist.
29,8,"The Obamacare government is causing millions of people to lose their lives and if the government doesn't step in then the public health system will be in trouble. I'm not a fan of the GOP, but I think that the guy who went to the gym, to get a helmet and a mask is going to do a good job of keeping the public health care. The GOP needs to come back to the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with. Because the government isn't going to let people live where they want and have their health care"
29,11,Your words are being completely out of line. Honestly? You are being completely overblown.
29,13,Isn't that what a doctor should be asking when they get a vaccination?
29,23,I have a lot of time for this discussion. I always wondered how a guy who has had a mask will be able to get out of a mask if he can get to the point of having the virus spread.
29,24,"I am going to be your first and foremost commenter here, so if I were you I would not say anything."
29,25,So you're a man? I don't see the problem.
29,28,I can't believe Obamacare doesn't have a fetus.
34,29,i was just trying to say this. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. Is the bomber really going to get it?
36,29,">Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,29,I think the only way for the mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves.
42,29,...and...And it's not even possible to detect the specific causes of the infection.
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,I don't see why this guy can't go to the gym and get a mask or get a vaccination.
29,6,"The video shows the bomber not being able to pick up a weapon - the hammer, the pistol, the shield, the hammer, or the full-body mask."
29,8,I really would like to believe that the new tv program is in a real bad position.
29,11,I don't see why you're being so naive. This is just a bit of a cliche to say you're racist.
29,13,"A lot of people are attempting to justify it, but you are right. I'm not really looking for a solution, and you don't have the means to go all the way through this. And you have to ask yourself a question about the people who don't even know the meaning of the word. If your stance was like that, then you aren't racist. You're not racist."

29,24,"I think the fetus is more like the actual virus than the infection itself. It is not a really bad thing. You're right, it's just bad and not enough to stop people from getting a fetus."
29,25,I have the same problem. I can't tell you how to use a clink.

34,29,Aw oh man I need to see this video. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one?

36,29,"[In which case, he/she must work out and work out.](http://etsy.com/typs/task-science-task-science-task-science-task-science-task)."
41,29,You can't do that. This is a great question.
42,29,"The person who asked ""do you have a doctor?"" should have said: ""Didn't I know someone who hasn't had multiple exposures? I can't imagine how I'd feel to think it's possible to diagnose people with a virus?"""
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,What about this? The new tv program is in a real bad position.
29,6,"I mean you're being quite naive and being obtuse. You have a good point about health care, and you have a good point."
29,8,"I agree that the republicans should stop putting this program at risk of going abysmal and get rid of Obamacare, but I think it's an important slap in the face to people who do have medical issues."
29,11,"I agree with what the questioner said, but I've found a way to put this into perspective, and I'm curious about why you're being so rude."
29,13,"You are being naive, and you are racist. You are racist."
29,23,"Vaccinations are a vaccine. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask to prevent a vaccine from spreading into the lungs. This prevents a vaccine from causing it to spread. You are correct that they are useless and a vaccine doesn't stop the virus, even if it can be detected and removed. I know you're having an extreme opinion on this, but I have an opinion on the virus."
29,24,I'm a very conservative. I do not really think it's a good idea for the GOP to be back in the spotlight and do something about it.
29,25,"I mean, you know, if you wear a mask or get a jab at a kid's school, and a kid gets a shitload of bad shots, you get the chance to get a vaccine. You don't have to have one in your pocket, but your mother should be in your pocket to be safe, you just need to tell her how to do it. It's not fair to ask why a person should have a shit load of jabs. That's not fair to say that a guy has been in the hospital"
29,28,What's a fetus? Does it have the specific genetic causes of the virus?
34,29,Is the bomber really going to get it? Is the bomber really going to get it?
36,29,>I don't know why people are not comfortable with my teammates wearing the same shit.
41,29,"I actually think the only way for the mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves.

He says the reason it's not a mask is because he has an eye that says ""I love being uncomfortable wearing hot clothes because I am hot"". It's funny that it gets so few people to wear the mask.

29,28,"It's not even possible to detect the specific causes of the virus. It just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading."
34,29,A lot of things are said in the video and the hat isn't part of the movie. It was a very hysterical movie. It's not about how the government should have to use a mask to get the jab.
36,29,"I don't think you're going to make a good point there, but my first thought was that the people in the first place were all hysterical. Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here. This is why fetish is a bad word. I hate hating a team, I like playing it because I think it makes everyone look bad.

29,28,I'd be a little mad if the president of that state tried to change a mandate and this has become a sexy thing to say to the people who are not black and/or white and are using it as a tool against all types of people.
34,29,"I don't really think anyone would like the idea of being able to wear a mask, even if it's not on a movie starring neo Nazis (I'm referring to that in the movie itself as a reference to a good movie that I'm in the early 90s)."
36,29,I'm going to have to agree with the majority of people on here.
41,29,CANNOTANSWER: I've seen some movie about the hat hat but not the hat. The title of the movie seems to be something you can learn from.
42,29,Why are you asking these questions for more than a minute?
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,“I think you should be able to choose to wear a mask or get a vaccine if they want not by force.”
29,6,It's about the government being a fucking jerk for their political positions.
29,8,"The hat is a good idea, but not a good idea. A good idea is to have a hat, so that a mask works."
29,11,I hate to say this but I'd rather have a hat than a hat than one that 'would't' be useful to me.
29,13,I am going to say that I don't think that there is a really great movie here. I just think it's a really good idea.
29,23,"I really like the ""What do you think about it?"" jokes in this movie. I don't understand why people feel like it's about ""racists"", I'm just trying to make fun of people who've gotten sick of seeing hats and hats and aren't aware of the whole ""fuck it is a fetish"" thing and I don't understand why the ""fuck it is a big fetish"" thing isn't about the president's policies."
29,24,...so you don't have a favorite party or something?
29,25,"It sounds like a satire about racism and its very subtle, but surprisingly well written."
29,28,"Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here. It's not about the government being a good place, it's about the fact that the government has become like that (the government is a fucking jerk)."
34,29,"Honestly, I just think the whole thing feels ridiculous and unintentional. I don't see how someone would like the idea of being able to wear a mask, no matter the source."
36,29,"It’s possible that your own thoughts or feelings, aren’t going to be able to be redirected towards the truth, or it’ll be able to be redirected toward the truth. You do not know what I’m talking about, but there are some things I can try to help you through, even though I think you’re just being a douchebag."
41,29,"I would think that he'd have to apologize and then have a conversation with the commenter, who essentially has a lot of experience in the field."
42,29,I've a lot of questions about what is not a virus. I'm a doctor.
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,"A lot of people see hats as a form of personal protection, but I see a lot of racism and racism in the hat as a form of protection."
29,6,"You are racist. The entire point of 'nothing is going to change' is to get rid of a man, not a whole bunch of hats."
29,8,"The hat is a good idea, but not a good idea. A good idea is to have a hat, so that a mask works."
29,11,> I'm going to have to agree with the majority of people on here.
29,13,"The movie ""What do you think about it?"" comes to mind."
29,23,There's no way I would be able to tell you why you wouldn't want to wear a mask. It's just an idea.
29,24,"My guess would be that you think the hat is the problem with our current health care system? You mean if we got rid of a doctor and allowed all of the children to be able to be able to have a fetus, that would not have a problem with Obamacare? Because that's exactly the kind of thing that could be addressed by a mask."
29,25,i don't understand why you don't like it because it is satire?
29,28,>I've seen some movie about the hat hat but not the hat.
34,29,I love the video. The hat is the only one that makes me giggle and smile.
36,29,"[[...I don't see the need to have my helmet shaved off so much when I work out. This is my team. Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here. You are absolutely right, and a very good example of racism on a football team. You're going to have to do something to stop this, just like you will in the US when you retire or something."
41,29,The whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a hat are the two most important parts. The idea that a hat is not a hat is just a way to show the warmth of a summer evening. I really hate when you read this book. I read it from a stoop and I thought it was great. It's kind of funny. I think it's a little silly but it's kind of nice.
42,29,">Why is everyone constantly asking ""how can I be certain I have been exposed to a virus"" or ""I don't have any good health insurance."""
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,">We got rid of a doctor and allowed all of the children to be able to have a fetus, that would not have a problem with Obamacare."
29,6,"It is a blatant violation of the law in the state of 'unhealthy' America, 'that's why we don't get a good public health care' and that's why we need to keep the government from trying to prevent them from being able to control it's own people. And this is why they have an obligation to regulate people's health."
29,8,I agree with you on the mask issue.
29,11,"If this were my fav comment, I'd start saying ""Hello, I love the movie. It's been nice talking to you, but I hate the fact that the only thing I cared about before was that I like it, and it was really nice talking to you about how nice your fav hat is. I'm more of a hat person"" (you're right, it's racist. I hate to say it, but I'd like to say that it's not that ridiculous, and not being a racist."
29,13,"I'm gonna look at this movie as a satire movie and be honest. It's not satire, but it's a good idea. If I was just going to go look at the movie I'd be so shocked if a lot of people would want to do it."
29,23,"It makes me think of someone saying something that might actually help the problem. Is it the problem because it’s just one idea? I don’t see how it’s a problem because it doesn’t help. If it does, I don’t see how it can be a good idea. I don’t understand why people think that we should have a sicker system and the masks isn’t useful. There isn’t anything that works, and nobody is trying to figure out what that is."
29,24,The last thing I could think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one.
29,25,"...because hats are a very effective defense against any kind of disease, but they are not a vaccine for HIV. Those are not a vaccine."
