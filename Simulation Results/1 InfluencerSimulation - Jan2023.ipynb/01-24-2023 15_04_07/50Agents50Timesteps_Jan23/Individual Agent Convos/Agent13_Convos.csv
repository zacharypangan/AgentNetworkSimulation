30,13,That's like the only time i ever wore a mask before i got a coach :/
31,13,"I'm not a doctor but I don't know much about vaccines. I think the problem is when people don't have a mask in them, if they don't get enough, they don't need to get the right one. I feel like that's pretty bullshit."

16,13,It's not about the mask. It's about the equipment.
17,13,"People just don't seem to see the value of wearing a mask or a protective shield if they don't really care. But the dangers of wearing a mask or using a 'good friend' mask, like your friend's cologne, make a very strong impression on the person they're buying it from."
29,13,I feel like there is a lot of talk about Obamacare being a good place for the GOP.
30,13,"Vaccines are not universal, they are not universal. It's a pretty common misconception in medicine to have a skin cancer and not to have a head shot."
31,13,"The mask mandate is still in effect for most of us, so there are no good reasons for a restraining order to be lifted."
37,13,"Well I mean, you can see a mask that you put on your head and put in your hands, you see your head and you see your head and you see your feet, you see your eyes, and you see your face. It's not just a mask, a hat. It doesn't even have to be a mask, it's a shield. That's the problem with hats and masks, and it does not really stop it."

16,13,"I think people should be ashamed of what they've said. If people think wearing a mask makes you sick and not feel better about yourself, then they shouldn't care. It's not the prick's fault that people keep putting their mask on themselves and make sure they wear the proper equipment. It's how that attitude works, no matter how much money they spend."
17,13,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed! The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate.
29,13,"You're a racist, right? Because, after all, you are a racist. I don't like how you are being blunt, and that's not what I am trying to say, but I think it's a little funny that a lot of people are attempting to justify that."
30,13,"I think the joke is about ""I'm not interested in identifying the specific causes of the disease. I think the people in this thread are too concerned with health care issues and not interested in identifying the specific causes of the disease."
31,13,The fact that this guy is a'really' great teacher doesn't make it any less real or interesting.
37,13,"I can understand why people don't wear the masks, but not because they think they're the best way to protect yourself. If a person has to go through the process of being protected, it's not a good idea for them to wear a mask to keep everyone safe. But I do agree that it is a terrible idea, and it's not a good thing you're not doing it to protect yourself, as there's a very different way to go about it."
39,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,13,"I have a friend in Georgia who likes wearing masks, so they wear them at all the time. There is a really nice place called The Georgia Mantis, which is a very nice place. But, we have to see some more of their hair, as well."

16,13,"It sounds like you're trying to explain the lack of a mask. And you're trying to describe what the mask is supposed to be doing. You're telling the guy you didn't read, and he's trying to explain what that means."
17,13,"I don't even know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. That's the kind of thing you would a little bit at a doctor to do if you don't get the vaccines you want, especially when it's a really important part of your life."
29,13,Isn't that what a doctor should be asking when they get a vaccination?
30,13,I don't think the title is funny.
31,13,"I am a sailor, I don't know about you, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm an athlete. I think it's nice to have that sort of information. I have to make sure to get as much information as possible before I give my kids a chance to get the right one. I've done a lot of work for a teacher in college. My parents were very protective and helpful towards me at school. I was able to put my kids in the right place, and the sailor made it that way, but I don"

39,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,13,I love to wear a mask to see things I've seen and felt I could see. But I wore a mask because I felt like I was wearing a mask and I felt like I was seeing something.

17,13,"You can hardly get the vaccine you want, because you're going to die."
29,13,"A lot of people are attempting to justify it, but you are right. I'm not really looking for a solution, and you don't have the means to go all the way through this. And you have to ask yourself a question about the people who don't even know the meaning of the word. If your stance was like that, then you aren't racist. You're not racist."
30,13,"I'm a huge fan of the style, so I'm so happy I went to the movies, but I never got a chance to see any of this movie."
31,13,"> I think the problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask. People are being pissed and not resigning because the aphids are showing up. If your teammates don't get the aphids, then your coach is screwed, if you're willing to quit, you won't resign."
37,13,The only people in the country that don't have a helmet are the aphids

17,13,"So you said the same thing in the title, like there's a guy at the expo in Indianapolis, and they can't sign an ACA law?"
29,13,"You are being naive, and you are racist. You are racist."
30,13,"I'm a little young. And they're saying: they shouldn't make it mandatory that every woman in the world can get the vaccine, because women aren't responsible for their own health. ""Why do people keep asking this? What is a virus?''''', ''Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I'm very good at getting my hands on the hot thing, I like the fact that it’s in that type of heat."
31,13,That is so cruel. I was told that masks are pretty common in schools. I don't know what a mask actually is.
37,13,"And it's a fucking joke that isn't a good idea, because fuck this person."
39,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,13,"I can see why they wear masks and their purpose is to mask other people. I'm in Georgia and my school district has a group of people that wear a mask. There's a story somewhere describing how people were told a few times they are the only ones who wear a mask. It's funny that it gets so few people to wear the mask. It just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading. But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better."

16,13,I'm actually a big fan of them.
17,13,"I’m not in any doubt you’ll never be able to believe the ACA. It’s pretty simple to get vaccinated, but I think it’s not a requirement to go to school with a doctor. You’ll also have to go to school with a doctor because if you don’t like your school they’ll not want you to. It’s ridiculous. If you don’t want to go to school with a doctor, the ACA won’t go through a lot of school counselors. You’re right"
29,13,It is the people who are racist who are racist.
30,13,"If you can't do anything about this, then you need to quit. And start a new project called Vaccines, and see how the message is communicated."
31,13,"I don't understand the whole ""I'm a teacher, I don't know much about vaccines."" thing."

17,13,"ACA screams anti-vaccination, not health. That's the premise of the bill, the law that people must go to school with a doctor, and not the health care. This isn't a ""right"" law. It's a ""sorry but you're right - I think you'll never get the vaccine you want, because you're going to die."" I love that ""the guy that is the guy that is the one to go to school with a doctor"" is actually the kind of thing people do not get to"
29,13,"I don't know how you can be a racist, but a racist can't be a racist. I have no opinion on health care, I'm an apologist and I have no idea what my stance is about. It is a huge issue."
30,13,I don't think anyone in this thread has ever questioned the morality of the film. The fact that it's a sarcastic title if anything that makes me question that was a part of the title is a part of the reason I'm on the receiving end of that.
31,13,"CANNOTANSWER: ""When I found it it would say ""I never get it"" (which I assumed was correct) because people who have had multiple exposures did not know the facts and the answer wasn't true."
37,13,Isn't it a joke because they're all freaking out when it comes to aphids?
39,13,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,13,The article was written about the whole thing. You can only wear masks if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask. Wearing a mask does not protect you against a virus. The resulting virus will be a result of the mask.

29,13,"It's important to note that, because of the fact that people like to think that a man can be a racist, it's not always the people who want to say it, like you do. It's just that when people want to be in a fight, the world is a 'great place'."
30,13,> How can i be certain I have been exposed to a virus in the past? I...

17,13,"It's ridiculous, and the idea of getting a mask is ridiculous. I hate the idea of being told the CDC can't pass a new law that mandates people to do this but the idea of taking the school for people who don't go to school is crazy."
29,13,"There are many examples of racists with masks, but a few are also racists. The one who saw it was an apologist for the republicans who wanted to help his team fight the bomber, whose face looks awfully hot and that 'hat' isn't in the video."
30,13,"This joke is a comedy, not a joke."
31,13,The first sentence is a little harsh.
37,13,"Yes, it is. It's a hat, a hat, that's supposed to stop the spread of aphids."

29,13,"It's about a lot of people being a fucking jerk for their political positions. It's not about the government being a good place, it's about the fact that the government has become like that (the government is a fucking jerk). It's not about any racists in the US, and I don't think that the white elite has the resources to do that."
30,13,"My mom, who is sick, asked me why my mom has a hat on and we hung out for about an hour and a half and that she had to wear it to go get it because my mom was sick. My mom told me a joke about being sick because I couldn't even tell what it was. She told me she was going to get a hat on so she could take the hat off and the joke was the same. I was like, ""why do you keep asking that?"" I was like, ""what's a hat is a "

47,13,"It was a joke. You know, for example, if you want to go to the doctor and get a x-ray, you could. But the doctor doesn't understand that wearing a mask does not help. A'mask' is basically the same thing that is used to imply that they can't give you anything."
