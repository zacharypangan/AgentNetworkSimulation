16,2,I've been to the gym 3 times this past weekend. You can still wear a mask if you can afford it.
16,7,"This is a huge misunderstanding that I've heard. We should all have the same problem here, the truth."
16,9,That's the joke. OP was speaking on behalf of a guy who was wearing a mask.
16,13,It's not about the mask. It's about the equipment.
16,15,"People who wear masks to protect themselves are going to die, not just from getting sick. They also will die to the same person if they are too sick to pay at the door. So the problem is they don't buy a ticket, the cost of one will increase."
22,16,"My doctor told me that after I became sick with a viral infection for over 5 months, the first treatment I wore for the rest of my life was to take a mask off. I decided to go off because I was sick and had to put it on. Then the doctors got my face healed with a flu shot. After I had taken it off I started being ill for about 2 weeks."
32,16,"Exactly. I don't get the body i want or break out on my face from having to wear a mask at the gym, but I figured i would get it from wearing a mask at the gym. I don't like the idea of getting the body i want or break out on my face from having to wear a mask at the gym, despite having a mask on. I would wear a mask every night, because I love them, so that i could do a lot of good."

16,13,"I think people should be ashamed of what they've said. If people think wearing a mask makes you sick and not feel better about yourself, then they shouldn't care. It's not the prick's fault that people keep putting their mask on themselves and make sure they wear the proper equipment. It's how that attitude works, no matter how much money they spend."
16,15,"OP said ""but if you wear your mask to protect yourself you'll get sick, if you're not paying at the door you will still get sick, and if you don't go to the door you'll die if you don't pay at the door."""
