49,38,wearing this mask and it being so hot
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,This will get to the mayor in an instant if the Mayor doesn't do this.
38,22,"I'm sick of hearing people complain that wearing a mask for more months is not actually good or effective, though I was able to convince a friend that I am not going to go on vacation for more months just because I was sick. The guy told me that it works, but I had to be on vacation a little while ago and I can't remember the word ""medical-vaccinated"" until we reached that point."
38,24,"The mayor of your state will probably sign a letter that says no, it's because there aren't enough funds to buy a public health mask, and the mayor knows about it."

51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,The city's vaccinating commissioner must also send a letter to the Mayor explaining the reasons for the mask.
38,22,"The mayor of your state will probably sign a letter that says no, it's because there aren't enough funds to buy a public health mask, and the mayor knows about it. This will get to the mayor in an instant if the Mayor doesn't do this."
38,24,"And the mayor will probably sign a letter to the mayor saying, ""This is too hot, you know he won't be willing to do this if you're really sick. """
43,38,I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.
49,38,"""The one with the most heat is wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask"
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,Almost as much as he should have. A lot of cities have it sprayed when they need it. And many cities have it sprayed every day.
38,22,"The mayor of your state will probably sign a letter that says no, it's because there aren't enough funds to buy a public health mask, and the mayor knows about it. The city's vaccinating commissioner must also send a letter to the mayor explaining the reasons for the mask."
38,24,"In that case, you could get your eyes shut and feel the heat in a mask, and he can wear a mask."
43,38,EDIT: I'm a bit more skeptical about the mayor's stance on the mask mandate than what he writes.
49,38,"This makes my head shake. I don't care what hot is it, but it makes me happy."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,"There's a difference between having a ""medical-vaccinated"" mask and being a full-vaccinated person because it's a good idea."
38,22,"I think the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know. I don't see a good reason not to. A lack of a health system will get you in sick. If he's not careful, you may want to talk to the mayor about it. The mayor might feel the need to ask for a letter in the coming weeks if he's not doing something so good in the long run."
38,24,And a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.
43,38,"If the council did not vote on this, then the council would probably have a vote. That being said, the state should make an effort to change the ACA's language to ""do not have a mandate"" in order to save money."
49,38,I can't believe he was telling this to you.. Is it the kind of thing that make you like a certain kind of guy?

38,22,I just had a snort in my head...
38,24,This makes me feel sad and happy. I think the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know. I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.
43,38,"OP is in the middle of the fight, because of this insistence of the mayor and the public health organization. I think a good majority of this is a part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole."
49,38,"ahhh, the movie about a man repping the heat. The guy wearing that mask is a reformed gay."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,"Having an MMR, I feel like the heat is just the start. It helps you get the idea that you are not doing anything good at all."
38,22,"It seems like this is more than a minor issue - the mayor of the city was probably going to have the authority to change the ACA to ""do not have a mandate"" because he was afraid of the mayor being wrong about his decision."
38,24,"If you are not a medical issue, you are not an asshole."
43,38,"Having a citizen with a state ID or a family passport, if you want to get a passport, you must first be a party member of the government. It is a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole."

43,38,>Is there any other reasons that could be put in place to prevent the health boards from reauthorizing the ACA?
49,38,"I don't have to suck myself in. There's something to it that I don't get. I'd be a hat man, but I can't be that cool at a movie."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,Having a MMR is not a problem for the government but is a good idea for those with a medical issue.
38,22,"The AMA doesn't address the actual problem here, but it addresses the question 'I don't like wearing a mask for more months'."
38,24,"This is a very good explanation. It's not like you were born with a flu virus, the vaccines are not a problem that will ever disappear. Having a mask will not help you, and this is the only reason that I think it's necessary to have them."
43,38,"I think the mayor should get rid of the mandate because it is a bad deal for the other party and it will make people feel that they are assholes. ""The mayor should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate."""

38,22,"What is the ""Mickey Man"" thing that's always come up on reddit?"
38,24,"What a movie is it? 'Mickey Man' was a lot like ""Reptile', resurrected a year ago. They were so sick and were a bad deal that they made it sound like they're getting worse and worse. That's how it sounds. They're doing great, you know, and they're making a good movie."
43,38,I've been on Reddit. I'm on here.
49,38,I agree with many of those aphorisms.

38,3,"I've been on Reddit. I'm on here. I agree with many of those aphorisms. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,22,The MMR mandate is not a problem for the government and it will make people feel that they are assholes.
38,24,"What the mayor was just saying was that the MMR was more important than the mask, so the mayor was not required to wear a mask. I don't think the mayor is able to have any more control over how much the mask has gotten used to and that's what the AMA is about."
43,38,The ACA was passed in the US House and this was a no-no.

38,24,"So, the message I'm getting here is I don't have to suck myself in. There's something to it that I don't get."
43,38,"Those are the ones that make me feel a little better. The ACA would be a bad deal if Congress snuffed the ACA out, and the voters would want to be in charge of the ACA for the entire 5 years that the ACA was repealed."
49,38,"My hat is hot and I don't really like the smell because I think it's too hot. It's not that hot, but I've seen hot hats, it's not that hot. It's a hat."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,I don't think that a person who thinks this isn't a doctor has anything to do with being sick and having to have a mr is in any way affected by the ACA. I don't think that being sick is an issue in itself.
38,22,I'm just getting here. I agree with many of those aphorisms.
38,24,">It's kind of hard to make a film that's made of the same material. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,38,"The ACA was repealed because the GOP is trying to stop people from getting vaccinated. This isn't how it works, the law was reauthorized because it wasn't going to be repealed."
49,38,Is that a joke?
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,3,Are you a hat man or a doctor?
38,22,"I can say with certainty that a lot of people who don't like wearing masks don't like being in their hats. But it doesn't mean they have to be able to make it work. And this is a great idea, not a good one. I don't think alot of people aren't interested in it, but that's about it. The MMR mandate is just as important as the ACA because if it is repealed the majority of people want to go to the doctor or even get a vaccinated, and"
38,24,I believe the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know.
