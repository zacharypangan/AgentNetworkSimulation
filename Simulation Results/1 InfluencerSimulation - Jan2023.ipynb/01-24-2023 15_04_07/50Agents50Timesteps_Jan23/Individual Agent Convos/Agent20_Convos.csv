24,20,i did this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center
30,20,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable
34,20,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
40,20,woman come on guys says you gotta wear a mask to go in there woman if you re not vaccinated woman exactly woman s daughter my momma says she s naturally vaccinated

30,20,"If you wear a mask to protect yourself, you can't go into the bathroom, you can't go into the bathroom. It's like you have to get a mask on or it'll get you hurt."
34,20,So is it true that the woman who wears the mask to protect herself doesn't wear this mask and it being so hot?
40,20,The mask mandate should not be lifted so that all women in the world can get the vaccine. That's why the public has to choose the people they want vaccinated.
50,20,I don't think I've slept well enough to take out a newspaper.
24,20,What is the reason why the US government would like to put the mask mandate in place?
30,20,"In my experience a man can not wear a mask, especially if he was unable to breathe in the car. When he wasn't working out, he would often get shattered on a motorcycle. And he couldn't just walk in and play if he wanted, he'd get shattered."
34,20,Typically the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer.
40,20,"So this isn't the point of the article? It was just saying that they didn't get the mandate lifted because women would be more likely to die if they weren't vaccinated, and not vaccinated because women will still get the mandate."
