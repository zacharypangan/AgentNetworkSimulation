41,39,"I would think the way that people would respond is pretty silly. I don't think that the mandate would have any effect on the shin and facial expression of the player, but I think the point of the mask mandate is to create a public discourse. If the mandate isn't lifted, then the only way for a player to 'wear a mask' is to put a mask on themselves, or put a mask on themselves and wear a mask involuntarily or at the expense of others in the field. I think that it would be pretty important for the player to be wearing "
