32,7,"What was the point of this post? I don't really see why it's so silly at all. I think people who have just had sex with men don't know how to say it's funny. The idea that it's funny is funny, but its not actually funny. People do, but it's a joke."
32,10,"The guy in the video said that wearing a mask for sex would kill a lot of people, but it also meant that while the joke was funny, it amounted to a joke that was about getting the body if you see it. So the guy isn't doing it right. This guy is being sarcastic about it, but he ain't doing it right."
32,16,"I feel if I were a girl, that would be great. I want to try it, it's just that I have a horrible lack of confidence. I've been there."
32,19,I can’t really put any weight on this. I’m going through a shitstorm.
32,23,"Isn't this the sarcastic part of the problem, as you said, that is? I would love to talk about the situation, and then if I'm in a situation like that and it turns out that there's an issue, I might feel slighted as a result."

32,19,I don't have to wear a mask to get into sex. It's just not a good joke. The problem is that you could have said that you don't like it at work. That was part of the sex scene.
