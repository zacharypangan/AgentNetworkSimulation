61,11,Why would you want to be in a riot when you don't have a mask at your party? I feel bad for you.
61,22,"It doesn't really matter how much you wear your mask. It's really just a mask, but you still have to wear one. Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
61,27,"I mean I could have an asthma attack if I didn't like the one thing you said? How much is it worth, to me, that wearing a mask isn't worth doing, and that isn't really a good idea."
61,28,The first step is to get the government on board with that. This is a stupid one. And I m afraid you'll need to pay your share of the bill to avoid it.
61,35,You know your right to die and infect (kill) others.
61,37,"I was going to say this about TWitchcon and Masks - but I had no clue it's a joke, I mean, it's all true that we're all different things. The crappy question is, is this a joke that was never said before? Do they have any specific rules on what happens when they actually wear their masks?"
61,49,i just learned this this morning and i was in a really hard funk lately
61,50,I was reading this a while back and was a bit confused as to why it was that simple. It's not like we'should'be wearing a mask anymore.
61,51,They don't know how to use a mask. And a mask is not. You cant just throw it on your face.
61,52,They said that it is illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of the virus. This is in response to Trump's recent comments about how it can be done without making any significant change in public policy.
61,60,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having

80,61,"i think it is ok not to wear a mask and ingraham is telling a story about the person she is in the room with, a mask and her face. it doesn't have to be true. i can't believe the government is getting so aggressive about it."
84,61,It's weird to be wearing a mask to get in to a restaurant and then going in to make it at a time when you're in a position to have a conversation with someone and you're not really in touch with them.
87,61,>We rescinded the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
93,61,"I wear a mask about 3 times a day, with my nose hanging out and the vent on."
61,1,It's the government's way of stopping the spread of a virus.
61,3,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,6,I thought the only reason that people got their masks because they didn't have any safety concerns was because they could get themselves infected and not wear it. I think a couple of reasons are why it doesn't have any protection at all:
61,11,"I'm getting sick a lot of the time, I wear a mask because I think a lot of people will get sick a little more frequently if they wear a mask at work."
61,22,"Basically, a mask is nothing and has no purpose. It's part of a government initiative to protect people from an outbreak of a virus, but it's not going to change in time."
61,27,So they're saying they're going to be a bad choice for the party? What's a joke?
61,28,You wear your mask every day and don't even notice the leaking? Do you get coughs from people? Or do you get a cough that just bleeds out and is too close?
61,35,"OP, you are not putting up with a joke like this."
61,37,I am not the government. It is just a way to protect the health of everyone else. There's only one way to protect yourself.
61,49,They're trying to make you feel good.
61,50,"This whole thing is a scam. I mean, I could have an asthma attack if I didn't like the one thing you said? How much is it worth, to me, that wearing a mask isn't worth doing, and that isn't really a good idea."
61,51,"IANAL. But to me that's really just how it works. I think the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus is part of a scheme they put in place to prevent people from getting a virus. That if I wear a mask for a month and get sick. It's a bit cumbersome. But if I have a tiger, I'm fine."
61,52,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,60,It is one of the most horrible things I have ever heard about. I really don't see it.

80,61,"I'm sorry, I can't even make a point to explain that I'm a black woman. And I've no clue how to go to a hospital. It's a terrible place. This is just a petty ad campaign. I can't make a point to a black woman but this is just a scam."
84,61,People from the U.S. live in the UK so it's a bit strange to live in the US. But it's interesting to hear that it's the government's way of making a mask to get into a restaurant.
87,61,"So you're gonna tell me that they were trying to force us to stop this? You're going to say, ""Hello, do you know how this happened"" and then rephrase it to ""Hey, do you know how this happened? We need to stop this,"" but then they won't let us stop it."
93,61,"I’ve been wearing a mask, but it get’s so annoying when I’m smoking."

61,50,This is pretty common in the United States. I'm in the United States and I have been wearing a mask and a mask for about 3 years now. I think it's part of the government's strategy to prevent and prevent outbreaks of viruses.
61,51,"I am a lawyer and I work in the healthcare industry in Texas, not DC. I can't tell you how much money I saved by not wearing a mask when my husband died of an asthma attack. I don't know how to properly keep my head up when I'm in that situation. If I need to stay in a mask at work, I have to keep them on, and if I have a bad day or two, I could go to a doctor and have a papilloma."
61,52,They said it was illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of a virus.

69,61,"I would rather be a hockey player, vaccinate at the game than a medical professional and probably need to wear a mask."
70,61,"It's a little sad, but hey, the CDC is the government that tells the people working there that you can be protected against the spread of a virus. You get to put on a mask, but you're not the person who needs a mask."
78,61,"In all honesty, I agree."
79,61,This is the reason I'm a very patient person and never made it to a doctor despite my best efforts at getting a doctor. That's why it's the only thing I can do to stop the spread of the virus.
80,61,I'm a black woman.

93,61,"I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone. When I was in the office and got out of a chair I wore a mask, if it worked, I would be able to avoid smoking cigarettes if I could."
61,1,I'm a doctor.
61,3,"I don't think it's the proper way for government to protect people from getting sick. Is there any way for it to work? If there is, it is a legitimate way to get away from people, it's not something you can do alone."
61,6,"You don't actually need to wear a mask, the company does, as a rule, not wear one that you don't know if it's dangerous. The mask is a temporary, wearable protective piece to prevent septic reactions in people, but you also have to wear it whenever you feel like you have to. It's not meant to stop you from spreading a virus."
61,11,What is it about being in a mask?
61,22,"I think that's a little silly to be talking about it. You can get an infection by putting on a mask, but you are not the person who needs a mask."
61,27,"You know, because the government is the one who actually is a bad choice for the Republican party."

69,61,"It's pretty cool that it's the third day that Twitchcon is on and that it's only a couple days ago, when the only thing I've noticed is that there are people who do the trick but don't want to wear a mask and want to go a while?"
70,61,That's actually not the CDC.
78,61,I'm very glad you posted this. This sub has helped me a lot to get on the right path.
79,61,This is the second one I read.
80,61,The truth is that this isn't a real thing.
84,61,I'm from Louisiana and was vaccinated twice for the first time in the summer.
87,61,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
93,61,My masks and dummy masks were used by an immigrant to stop the spread of a virus.
61,1,"It sounds like the whole government is not interested in the issue, but more of a joke."
61,3,"It's a business thing, not the national discussion."
61,6,"I think the point of a mask is to give yourself the edge and get away from everyone. When I was in the office and got out of a chair I wore a mask, if it worked, I would be able to avoid smoking cigarettes if I could."
61,11,"What's the matter? Are you being sarcastic? Are you being a dick, or is this just the media trying to force you to go outside?"
61,22,"Considering the government wants to prevent the spread of a virus, I think a mask will actually save more lives than a septic reaction to cigarettes."
61,27,It's in the news today.
61,28,"In some ways, it's called an 'infection mask'."
61,35,"The government is very, very concerned about spreading viruses and causing their own disease. This is the problem in the medical world."
61,37,"[In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapidAskSir), and are worn on an everyday basis. You can see this in the ""Mask you"" posts."
61,49,"""I think it's a marketing thing, not a political thing. It's not the issue. It's a national conversation that's a business thing, not the national discussion."
61,50,So the issue isn't your mask. It's a 'war on drugs'. They're just trying to make a deal with people.
61,51,"So, how much money saved do you think he saved?"
61,52,"The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone. They're used in some of the most difficult settings to detect a virus. If you do not want to try to stop it, then you should try to stop the infection."
61,60,"It's very hard to believe it's the right thing to do and that it is illegal to do that. The CDC is not liable for the consequences of it because its the wrong thing. If it is a commercial, they will probably be liable for any consequences of their actions. But this may be a great way to get some relief from the public's frustration."
69,61,The mask is the only thing that twitchcon was actually supposed to be about. It's a joke.
70,61,I'm a male. I do not wear a mask. I work.
78,61,This is one of the best things I've done in my entire life.
79,61,"I don't know if that's true or not, but my mom used to wear it a lot to keep her in check. I remember being bitten by a bug while she was a kid and my mom never told me it was a flu so she asked me to go away and we found out she had a virus... I thought about it a bit, but just didn't realize it was a flu virus until I started doing it a year ago and kept it as a weapon when she was a young woman with HIV. I've had a virus "
80,61,"We need to move, and get our masks back, because it's a big issue, but this isn't a real thing."
84,61,Is there any chance that the CDC could do something like this?
87,61,"The only person who can say it isn't true is an actual government official. The AIDS government has said that they are going to take steps to stop the spread of the virus, and that a mask isn't going to stop that."
93,61,"This is not about how they worked, it's about the dangers of wearing a mask and how they rely on their victims."
61,1,"""It sounds like the whole government is not interested in the issue, but more of a joke."""
61,3,"""I think the point of a mask is to give yourself the edge and get away from everyone."""

61,11,"So, here is the real problem."
61,22,"""We need to move, and get our masks back, because it's a big issue, but this isn't a real thing."""
61,27,Is it illegal to wear a mask?

61,37,I read the twitchcon thread in my head.
61,49,"In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus, and are worn on an everyday basis."
61,50,"So, the main problem with this is that the government has put in place these new laws to get people to wear them, and they have nothing to do with it. I don't think you need to go there to get a mask. You don't have to wear a mask."
61,51,"I'm not sure if that's true, but I'm not sure the US government is so concerned with it. But the fact is they are doing it to help with the spread of a virus."
61,52,"I'd have a hard time stopping it. I would probably get out the door if I were to say, ""Oh, I'm sorry that didn't work out for you, but I think it's better to let you get out of a job, because I'm not going to be able to avoid the other issues in your country that you guys need to get rid of."""

79,61,It's the only thing I can do to stop the spread of the virus. I don't care what they say about the masked word.
80,61,Ingraham's story is part of a campaign.
84,61,"I am a little embarrassed at the whole thing, but I am also ashamed about the fact that this is happening."
87,61,I feel the masks are a big deal for the US to use to help the spread of HIV.
93,61,This is so funny and creepy.
61,1,"I am not an attorney. I am an attorney. I can not make a judgement call unless my attorney was right. i am an attorney, but it's not a choice."
61,3,I'm so glad it's not a big deal. I'm a criminal. I want to make sure the US government isn't taking the bad guy out of the game.
61,6,The only real problem is how many people actually use a mask in the US.
61,11,I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,22,I don't even know if you know what a broom snoot is. Honestly I'd say it is quite a simple joke.
61,27,"Well, it sounds like they just can't seem to control the spread of the virus."
61,28,"What did you just say? This is not a good story. This is a bad one. If you were to ask a question, you should give them your response. This is what the other commenter is saying."

61,52,"I was told the same thing about my grandmother, who was in the office and threw up. And we said it was 'a big deal' to let her get out of her house and not to help anybody. And they said, 'You do not want to help people, but you can help them.'"
61,60,That's something I haven't heard about in this thread.
69,61,Vaccination is not mandated in every state.
70,61,I'm so glad I don't think people understand what they're talking about.

61,1,People seem to like the idea that if the government didn't do something to stop the spread of a virus then they would have to get away with the work.
61,3,Vaccination is not mandated in every state. So you are in a really interesting spot.
61,6,"It's hard to say, but I believe the truth is that you've never done it."
61,11,The CDC has called for mandatory sterilization. The only real problem is how many people actually use a mask in the US. I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,22,"Considering the government wants to prevent the spread of a virus, I think a mask will actually save more lives than a septic reaction to cigarettes."
61,27,"Unless you're talking about a virus, what's the real problem here?"
61,28,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,35,It is also a very bad idea to taint a face with a mask and then use it to make an AIDS patch. It's an old joke.
61,37,I am very happy that this thread came out and you posted it here!
61,49,It's a marketing thing. I've never heard of it before.

61,60,"I'm not even gonna give a very good answer, but I will tell you what:"
69,61,They're both jokes. I just want to be blunt - they are blatantly funny.
70,61,I guess this has nothing to do with the NSA.
78,61,I think that you've gotten the right idea.
79,61,"The word ""masked"" is the droll part."
80,61,">Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in!"
84,61,I know that the fact that you think it's an opportunistic idea is kind of surprising.
87,61,What are some of the other things that are considered to be real?
93,61,"It seems that, as a person who's in the 'right' position to get a job like this, a tarot card is a good idea."
61,1,"They're funny, if you're looking for a job."

61,22,I think that is just a tarot card if they don't even understand what they're doing and are thinking about what other things they are doing and are actually trying to do their job
61,27,This is a really good question.
61,28,"A mask could be used to stop the spread of a virus, which is a very rare and dangerous disease."
61,35,"The joke is ""Of course we have to do something better in public. In the meantime, I will be wearing an AIDS patch."""
61,37,"Unless you're talking about HIV, I'd probably say that's a joke you don't think it's a joke, and that it's probably a real thing. But it sounds like an old, old joke and it's a bunch of old stuff that isn't supposed to be funny."
61,49,I don't think it's a marketing thing. It's a'marketing thing'. But it's a marketing thing. There are no laws denying anyone else to wear a mask.
61,50,This is the biggest joke I've ever heard.
61,51,A lot of white people are allergic to masked people.
61,52,It was the NSA's policy to stop the spread of the virus.
61,60,"I would take an upvote if i didn't write them out, like this."
69,61,This is why the government does not have mandates for vaccination in all states. There is nothing wrong with the government. It is a mandate.
70,61,I know you don't get what I'm saying.
78,61,"We've tried wearing a mask twice in a row, i haven't stopped wearing it, but i think it will get better"", 'In all honesty, I agree.'"
79,61,"""The government is basically making this very hard, especially with all the ridiculous people."
80,61,"A lot of people like to talk about AIDS as a social problem, whereas other countries use it as an excuse to do so."
84,61,"I do this at work and the government has made it illegal in every state in the United States. Vaccines are illegal here, whereas in the UK it's not."
87,61,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
93,61,"I think the issue is that it's not a scam, it's a fraud. It's like saying that ""A woman in a suit and a suit will be trying to protect her hair from a virus. I think she's doing it to protect herself and her family."""

61,3,"""It is also a very bad idea to taint a face with a mask and then use it to make an AIDS patch."""

61,35,Are you actually trying to get the government to give you the opportunity to do it?
61,37,"I read somewhere that people say ""Masked is an essential part of government policy to prevent the spread of a virus."
61,49,"They've already banned the wear of their masks, though. It's a marketing thing, not a marketing thing."
61,50,You sounded a bit crooked.
61,51,The joke is not funny at all.
61,52,This is a really good question. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,60,That's pretty damn funny.
69,61,"Why would it be a joke, if it was in the CDC's interest? You can have them do the trick for you. But you can't eat shit."
70,61,You're not being a troll shithead to my face.
78,61,"a mask that helps prevent spread of a virus is not a good idea. i've been in a twilight era and have had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses. I'm going to take a stab at this twilight era virus that you're infected with."
79,61,"""...In other words, they are a nightmare. I've never done it, but I know I’ve found it to be just plain useless."
80,61,I'm not sure why people think this is so important. I don't see how this is a fake thing and how they can make you look so stupid.
84,61,"I'm gonna use a few sentences, and just say the same thing : [The thing is, it's not illegal in every state. They are a very large part of government spending. That is why it's not illegal in every state. I don't think putting on a mask is an opportunistic idea. I'm not asking about it because a lot of people are not vaccinated. I'm asking about putting on a mask. I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks,"
87,61,"I don't like the government. I'm sorry, but what do you think the government is trying to stop?"
93,61,"I think a mask is more of an escape form then an actual tarot card. It's just not true, and I think the government is trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
61,1,I wore a mask every day because of a 'vaccine' problem.
61,3,"You don't say. Your post is being misleading, and you're right to be confused. The people who write this are the right people. The people that cite the 'hijacking' are the right people. The people who haven't cited it for them are right and they are wrong. They can't cite your article if they are wrong. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The government is a bad choice for the Republican party."
61,6,I am very sorry for all the negative comments.
61,11,What exactly does a mask have to do with the spread of a virus?
61,22,I'm a twitchcon reader. I've read several books on this topic.
61,27,"if you’re going to be asking about putting on a mask, you’ve got a great point"
61,28,I think it’s cool to know that you’re not a Republican. But I don’t know how you want to look like a crooked troll.
61,35,I'm not gonna stop you. I don't know. But I'll give you my opinion.
61,37,That's really a fucking weird tidbit. What's a fucking joke?
61,49,"They could ban anyone else to wear the mask, and that would be a bad idea."
61,50,"If a government wants to rip a profit off your mouth, they need to make that deal with you first and foremost. They can go to your mouth and rip your throat. You can't just stop with a mask if you don't stop."
61,51,"I wore a mask in my home town of Chicago. When my boss told me this I would wear it, he said, 'I don't like it. Because I'm black'."
61,52,A really good question. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

78,61,"I think he's referring to the twilight era as ""Twilight"" in a bit."
79,61,OP is the one who is going through an act of terror.
80,61,It's not like you're a black person or a woman. That's just not true. This is just a scam. It's a scam.
84,61,"So basically, a mask isn't something to be ashamed about. It's a thing to show off to friends and family. What do you think? Is it an obvious thing to show off to friends to see what other people are doing? Do you think this might be an interesting idea?"
87,61,"Trump has been so bad that he's able to get an infection in his face by going on a long term vacation in Texas, and he's also in the Navy. I would recommend he keep his mouth shut or at least talk to his wife about her plight."
93,61,">I'm not a lawyer, but I know a lot of people who are in fact getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads/ schemes/ lies."
61,1,I've got the same problem with a lot of people who are actually getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads/ schemes/ lies.
61,3,The government is a bad choice for the Republican party.
61,6,I think the only real problem is how many people actually use a mask in the US.

61,49,I don't want to get sneezed at as much as you do.
61,50,The fact that a mask is being used is a huge red flag.
61,51,"There are many tarot cards that are used in the world to help people in need. I mean, the only time I see it is when a guy tries to get me in the bathroom, or if it's because I don't have a mask, and I get a cough that bleeds out and is too close."

70,61,"The only way a prank can be true is to have the people get a bad rap. They don't actually get a bad rap. The CDC is being a prank because it's a joke, and a prank because it's a joke."

79,61,"Well, the way the CDC manages to stop the spread of TB is the way they think it is a joke, that's for sure."

84,61,"In the UK, it is not illegal to appoint a doctor and/or take a tampon."
87,61,"The tarot card is a tarot card, a card that tells the story of the situation, but you can't go into a tropical country without a mask."
93,61,I think the tarot is one of the most popular and effective things to use when doing something like this. They're not like the cards in the card in the wiki.
61,1,"I think there are some tarot cards that are jokes - you have to get rid of them, so why not get a mask?"
61,3,"The whole article is not about the CDC. It is about the CDC. It is about the CDC's role in the spread of HIV. It is about the CDC trying to stop the spread of the virus. It is an interesting topic and this is not about you. I think it is about the CDC, but a monopoly on the internet."
61,6,And I think it's a joke that's going to ruin the fun for many people. And I don't even have to read the tarot card.
61,11,People who play tarot cards tell other people in the world that putting on a mask prevents the spread of HIV by encouraging them to play the tarot and/or make a joke about it isn't a joke.

61,37,The CDC is not being a prankster and it doesn't seem like a joke.
61,49,The CDC is trying to stop a prank that's not actually a joke.
61,50,"The problem isn’t that people can’t actually see a prank by reading a tarot deck or reading the article. The problem is that a lot of people are not aware of the jokes that are taking place. It’s just a joke, and it’s definitely not a joke. The government is a big part of it. The government and the tarot are real scammers, and despite their big money they do nothing. It is just a joke."
61,51,It sounds like there are other things people can be aware of. And I'd definitely look into a book on the CDC if you're not familiar with it. It's really the only book that I've ever found out about.

79,61,"It's a joke. It's a joke that's about preventing health problems for people. It's about making fun of people, but if a joke isn't the right thing to do. It's a joke, but not about stopping a disease."

The CDC has an official contract with the CDC and is a vendor. The mask is not the same as the government's policy. They are supposed to be involved in the marketing of vaccines."
