92,80,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
80,4,As in they have no interest in having anyone to wear a mask that you don't want a public view on. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
80,8,That OP is the one who's trying to get it.
80,9,"We need to move. And we need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."

80,19,That's a good way to protect yourself against the virus and to do so without worrying about your rights.
80,22,i don't think any ms. ingrahams are allowed in a home where a petty ad campaign is going on.
80,28,"I feel your pain. There are people that aren't really interested in having a lawyer, not a doctor, just a friend or family. We've been there, and they're doing it."
80,32,Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them.
80,37,"I have a picture of a man and his sexy face in his bedroom with a mask over it - they look the same, not as if they are a child."
80,39,"That is not correct. The US has no real interest in the subject of the virus unless it is a virus. The threat isn't actually a virus, it's a fungus."
80,40,I wear a mask every day but that is the thing with people like Hillary.
80,47,"A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
80,49,The Obama government is blatantly destroying the lives of innocent people.
80,50,This whole thing is a scam.
80,51,"""As you have told me to tell me to go get my mask, I'll get mystico to wear it to help vaccinate everyone."""
80,61,"i think it is ok not to wear a mask and ingraham is telling a story about the person she is in the room with, a mask and her face. it doesn't have to be true. i can't believe the government is getting so aggressive about it."
80,62,"We need a government that doesn't have a full face mask, so we can't put it on our head."
80,63,He wants people to not be forced to put masks on so that they don't come up with a reason for it
80,68,...But she hasn't made any attempts to help.
80,75,I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a black person. You need to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to kill others - the fact that you can't even kill yourself doesn't matter. I would be very happy if I was black.
80,77,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
92,80,I feel like I lost my mask and then my purse.
80,4,This would be the kind of thing that would be seen as a crime.
80,8,"I have to tell you the other day, I am a little embarrassed that I have been in the room, and I haven't gotten the mask I have been wearing."
80,9,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We need to move. And we need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."

80,19,"The trolls here are in the wrong, not in the wrong."
80,22,"I am so sorry, Ms. Ingraham."
80,28,"There's a lot of truth in these stories. I'm black, and I grew up in a small town and I just sat around in a fucking room. Fortunately, I did not live in the country. I grew up in a small town, and the neighbors were the same fucking family. That and he got a job, and that's all you had to get. I'm a redneck, I get it. I'm afraid I didn't give them a chance."
80,32,"You can't put a mask on yourself, you'll just be in an accident and the government will take it away."
80,37,"In the US, there is no actual law that obama has ever vowed not to be the first to use a mask on women. This is also why they are using the term ""skunks""."
80,39,"I'm not sure how anyone could have any evidence that the virus was being spread, but if that's the case, I would assume the government would be more concerned about the issue."
80,40,"It's too bad that the federal government has the authority to impose restrictive policies on the people, but I think the fact that this is going to get more attention from people is not fair."
80,47,"This is about a conspiracy theorist, and the anti-viral conspiracy theory is about a group of unrelated fucking hypocrites. The president is not a scumbag. The guy is actually trying to stop the spread of the disease, and the government is destroying his rights. I'm not saying the man who said it was ok to wear a mask is an asshole, I'm saying that while people are using the same strategy as other people, and not wearing a mask is actually a good way to do it."
80,49,">We need to move. And we need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."
80,50,"i would be very happy if i was black. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in"
80,51,And that's the way to protect yourself.
80,61,"I'm sorry, I can't even make a point to explain that I'm a black woman. And I've no clue how to go to a hospital. It's a terrible place. This is just a petty ad campaign. I can't make a point to a black woman but this is just a scam."
80,62,"No, we don't. We have to be aware of your rights, we need to have a conversation about what they mean, what a good deal of things have happened."
80,63,"I see this as a scam. If she is going to do something like this, you should be more concerned about the risk of a virus, than about a good ad campaign campaign. That's why a lot of people get offended by the Obama government. The US government is obviously not in charge of the security of others."
80,68,Are you a white person?
80,75,"Ayay, it's time to get your privacy back."
80,77,They are a bunch of people who are getting more information in regards to the US government as a whole. I'm just pointing out that it's an important issue.
92,80,I feel like I lost my mask and then my purse because I'm afraid I'm going to be tripped up by it.
80,4,"The only reason you would be on the receiving end is because you're trying to get into the military and want to be protected. So you're trying to get into the military. But you're going to have to go through the trouble of getting a mask, the government isn't supposed to be there to stop the spread of a disease, and you need to move. You've already gotten into the real fight, and you're going to have to make the decision to move."

80,9,"So here we are with the guy that lied to make the joke. He’s trying to stop the spread of the virus, and the government is destroying his rights?"
80,18,"You can't put a mask on yourself, you'll just be in an accident and the government will take it away. In the US, there is no actual law that obama has ever vowed not to be the first to use a mask on women."
80,19,"This isn't ""scam"" at all."
80,22,"What the fuck! How is it ok not to wear a mask? If you're black, your right to be protected from the government. I'm gonna start putting on a mask."
80,28,"The trolls here are in the wrong, not in the wrong. I am so sorry, Ms. Ingraham."
80,32,"Ayay, it's time to get your privacy back."

80,39,"I'm going to be honest. In my opinion, if the government hasn't actually said anything, I can't see the issue and just have a hysterical talk about it."
80,40,"I know this is a joke but this is not true. The guy is a scumbag. The trolls here are in the wrong, not in the wrong."
80,47,"> We need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."
80,49,This is really not what the comments are saying. :(
80,50,I don't think that's a good ad for you to look at. There are a lot of issues with the health care system. I think the fact that some people do this is a big deal in my country.
80,51,"'""As you have told me to tell me to go get my mask, I'll get mystico to wear it to help vaccinate everyone.""'"
80,61,I'm a black woman.
80,62,"The fact that you're a black woman is very worrying. It's just that this is a scam. It doesn't come off as ""cosplay,"" it's an ad campaign."

80,75,Nope. What's so funny about them is the idea that it's a scam and then the government wants to make an anti-viral statement about the problem.
80,77,"I think it's good that the Obama administration is acting on this, and they have a pretty broad mandate about how to treat people."
92,80,"I was actually on a long journey to get a good fit, and found a good AIDS med that worked for me. It's an incredible piece of work and I stayed there with it for almost a year. The doctor said it was a scam but if it was the same way, it wasn't a scam."
80,4,Are you a white woman? This is not a scam. The government needs to be in charge of treating HIV/AIDS.
80,8,I'm an American male and I am trying to have a positive view on Obama's policies.
80,9,It's not a joke. That is the shit.
80,18,"It's all about what's really important. It's an important issue, which is why we should all move."
80,19,"This isn't a scam, this is a fraud."
80,22,"I'm sure the doctor wouldn't mind if you said that you are black and in your head, because that's how he's doing it."
80,28,It’s a scam. They are claiming to be the biggest fraud on the internet.
80,32,I'm so sorry but I don't know if I could get it back? I have a friend that lives in a house that has a house in his back yard.
80,37,"Despite this being a joke, it is a good idea to keep it in a safe place. The only way we can prevent people from getting sick or have them vaccinate is through a a government funded AIDS med, which is not even a good idea. It's very ill advised."
80,39,"AIDS - ""How is it ok not to wear a mask?"""
80,40,The idea of saying the US government is the government is a scam?
80,47,"AIDS is one of the most sexy things on the planet today, right? People in the country are on a pathological limb to stop it."
80,49,"i read that in the comments, ""We need to move. And we need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."""
80,50,You are going to get a fucking sickle pigeon on top of this? I can't even look at the face.
80,51,"It's not a scam, it's a scam. You can have any ad with a mask on if you're black."
80,61,The truth is that this isn't a real thing.
80,62,"If you don't see it, you're being a bitch."
80,63,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So here we are with the guy that lied to make the joke. He’s trying to stop the spread of a virus, and the government is destroying his rights? You can’t put a mask on yourself, you’ll just be in an accident and the government will take it away."
80,68,"Yes, I'm in a vaccinated state if you are not in the US. But you have to have a lot of respect for the privacy of your own body and the privacy of the entire state if you want to continue to live there."
80,75,You have to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them? [(http://www.gov.nolo.gov/police/police-discrimination-politics.html)?
80,77,What is your national security number?... what is your national security number?
92,80,Vaccination is not a fraud and the people who do it are being told that. It's not that hard to do.
80,4,I don't think this is a rumor.
80,8,"It's a good idea to bring a big red flag. In the United States, there's a lot of blatant government interference."
80,9,"I don't think that's what he means. It is. He is describing AIDS and not how it got revoked by a government agency, which is what's being said."
80,18,"You are going to get a fucking sickle pigeon on top of this? I can't even look at the face. It's not a scam, it's a scam."
80,19,"If you want to save my life, please tell your family. I lied to the government about how my friends had AIDS, and they got it fucked up by the government."
80,22,"The sexist government is a scam, and the scumbag who is doing this is a dick"
80,28,"I was just reading your comment on this. I've never thought about a government-funded AIDS med or the truth. It's not a scam, it's a scam. It's not like the federal government has the power to control the public's health care."
80,32,"The government is trying to erode our privacy by taking a very expensive vaccine. If people don't want that then why don't we change their minds about it, since we are the only nation in the world with the right to choose between being protected by the government and being able to move."
80,37,"""If i'm in a vaccinated state, I'm going to get a fucking sickle pigeon on top of this?"
80,39,That's a bit of a stretch.
80,40,The US government has a long history of being corrupt. There is a strong culture against it and the US government has a long history of being scumbags.
80,47,Isn't the Obama administration trying to convince you that his comments about masks are wrong?
80,49,You're in the right to not slap a mask on yourself.
80,50,There is a huge problem with this type of stuff. You can't just get rid of the government to have your health at risk.
80,51,"If I were you, I'd be very afraid of you. I have a friend that lives in a house in his backyard and I would hate to see his face in the picture because I know he would want to see me in a mirror."
80,61,"We need to move, and get our masks back, because it's a big issue, but this isn't a real thing."
80,62,"“That’s not a scam, this is a scam. They are claiming to be the biggest fraud on the internet."
80,63,This is why I live in America.
80,68,"""We should move. This isn't a scam, this is a fraud."""
80,75,"Well, not at all. They are destroying all our privacy in order to get it back. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though. I know they are taking their money from people who are already infected and are still infected, but there is a lot of money out there that is going to go to help stop this disease if not stopped by a government funded med. That’s pretty much all the people who are attempting to get their people infected, the government, or some way."
80,77,"I just want to add this, to the list of people who seem to be getting more information about the US government as a whole. I think it's good that the Obama administration is acting on this, and they have a pretty broad mandate about how to treat people."
92,80,That's an AIDS scam. I figured I'd just ignore it because I figured it was a scam and I would only ever wear it for a few days.
80,4,"Obamacare, a government funded AIDS program, and Obamacare. They aren't just using them to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS - they're using AIDS to help people with it."
80,8,"In the US, they use the “weaker med” to control the government. I don’t know about CDC but you need to tell your doctor that the government is doing these kinds of things."
80,9,They've got their hands full of money. The public can't afford to do what they want.
80,18,I've read some of this on the front page. It’s an article for a news outlet. This article is about a federal government invading the nation. It is very strange how many times a Republican has voted on this. I think that this might be the first time a Republican government has voted in favor of the use of a mask on the white house.
80,19,Why can't people talk to their doctor about this?
80,22,AIDS virus is very prevalent in North Korea. This is probably the most prevalent type of HIV virus in America.
80,28,I think you're misunderstanding some of the more recent stuff from the previous week.
80,32,It's probably better to move to the suburbs now than to live on the fringes of the city.
80,37,Isn't the government corrupt? I believe it's just in an attempt to justify the government doing so.
80,39,"I've always wanted to wear a mask, and if they do not care about me, I'll take their word for it. But they still use a mask."
80,40,This is the US government that I want to see in the future.
80,47,So what the fuck are you talking about?
80,49,"The only thing Obama is doing is eroding the US government's reputation and influencing other countries to take this seriously. The government and the people who use it are not to blame. They want it to stop, they want it to stop."
80,50,I don't understand your point.
80,51,"I don't think the U.S. government is helping, but I do believe they are trying to sell a vaccine to protect the public."
80,61,Ingraham's story is part of a campaign.
80,62,"The government is making money off of this, so they're trying to get your family to vote to stop them claiming they've done it."
80,63,"Having a mask on yourself is the greatest thing you can do, right? Just don't go. It doesn't change the fact that you can't get yourself sick and you can't make a good life and they're gonna have to take away your rights, which is one reason why they do not give out your freedom."
80,68,"Is that not a scam or a fraud? Certainly. But what if there were a 'dark' Obama about that, I'm afraid I would be too."
80,75,They are the scumbags. I’d be very happy to see people in the mirror.
80,77,"I was reading this about a time ago where my mom would look at me in a mirror and tell me how horrible it was. The next day I told her he'd been a bad scumbag for having a fucking mask that was so unfunny! She would be a huge fucking scumbag! You scumbag, you'd get a fucking pigeon. I'd probably die, but she was a terrible scumbag."
92,80,It's not a scam because AIDS is a really serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
80,4,Honestly I can't find the answers to all those things. AIDS is the biggest problem for the U.S. government.
80,8,They’re trying to swindle the public into thinking they’re a great deal worse off than they have been.
80,9,"I have been bitten by it a bunch, and it can be hard for me to figure out if there's anything I can do about it - maybe that's my problem."
80,18,"Obama said he would wear a mask, so I'm going to go with my neocon."
80,19,"Yes, you're right. If you want to help, they have to work with you on the vaccination, so the people who lied to Obama are to blame."
80,22,"Its not ok not to wear a mask, and Ms. Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."""
80,28,"> ""The trolls here are in the wrong, not in the wrong. I am so sorry, Ms. Ingraham."""
80,32,There are plenty of people with AIDS who want their privacy back.
80,37,"The issue is not about the mask, it is about the mask."
80,39,This is the type of post that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
80,40,"I'd say that most of this is nonsense. I think people are really frightened by the idea of a 'dark' government, which is something most Americans don't realize they're entitled to."
80,47,"Having a mask on yourself is the greatest thing you can do, right? Just don't go. It doesn't change the fact that you can't get yourself sick and you can't make a good life and they're gonna have to take away your rights, which is one reason why they do not give out your freedom. I'd probably die, but she was a terrible scumbag."
80,49,Obama is making money off of this. It's not a scam because AIDS is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
80,50,"Yes, but I also don't think the President is doing anything to protect you from the vile scumbags that are trying to sell the government a vaccine."
80,51,"This was the biggest thing I learned about politics when I read the first part of it and my first thought was, ""What about all these ""wars"" and the 'wap"" in my head?"
80,61,The president did some sloppy things but didn't change anything. His wife has HIV/AIDS and I think this is very much a conspiracy against him.
80,62,It is a scam to sell a vaccine against a disease. Having a mask on yourself is one of the main reasons. They don't know how to get around it if they're a bad person. This is a scam if the government wants to spread a virus.
80,63,People are not going to do anything wrong unless they agree with their doctor.
80,68,This is something that is a lot of people don't seem to understand.
80,75,A friend of mine is also infected with AIDS and has to do some testing to prove it's not that dangerous.
80,77,Obama is helping the US government stop the spread of AIDS and you can't just ignore it.
92,80,Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. It's not a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is wrong.
80,4,"> ""The trolls here are in the wrong, not in the wrong."
80,8,"It isn't a scam, it's a scam. The president is helping the US government to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is wrong."
80,9,"I would go to an AIDS clinic, get it checked out. You have all kinds of other people who have a vaccinated AIDS. It's not a 'dark' government, it's a government sponsored vaccination. This is all an affront to you as well."
80,18,It's a scam if the government wants to spread AIDS.
80,19,It's a fraud to try and sell a vaccine.
80,22,... and the scumbag who is doing this is a dick.
80,28,"Despite all the nonsense, what can I say is that this is the most important thing I can do to make Obama and other Republicans think we have the right to go to the party and help our health."
80,32,"The only thing to do is ignore all the warnings from the government, and don't think about the people and things that go wrong."
80,37,In the US it is one of the most expensive medical procedures you can get. I'd recommend checking with your doctor and see if they're happy with your choice.
80,39,"I'm a teen, and I feel like I owe this whole country. It's kind of the same with many issues of American culture and national identity and a lot of people just don't get it."
80,40,A friend of mine is also infected with AIDS and has to do some testing to prove it's not that dangerous.
80,47,This is the type of post that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
80,49,That's really not what the comments are saying.
80,50,It's not a scam. It's a scam. Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
80,51,AIDS is a serious disease.
80,61,">Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in!"
80,62,"There is a big difference between being a troll, and being a conspiracy theorist."
80,63,"I live in America. And AIDS is pretty serious, I can't imagine that. It's ridiculous and silly to think about it and then have to read more on the Internet and see where it goes, so I'm just taking what I have for my life."
80,68,"So, what's the big deal with Obama? This isn't a fake election. Isn't the government really a bad guy? This isn't some conspiracy theory."
80,75,">I am in the government because I'm a black person. You need to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"", ""I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a black person. You need to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"", ""I hope"
80,77,I'm not saying it's not a scam. I'm saying that the government should educate itself on the issue and try to educate themselves to the necessary level of safety.
92,80,They are the only ones that don't do that
80,4,"""Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"""
80,8,"I don't understand why the president doesn't get that - the only reason the president's scumbag has been involved is because the CDC isn't giving the vaccine and so much as trying to influence his policies (although they have been doing it for awhile now, the Obama administration is a bit off now)."
80,9,"We also have the chance to evict people if they get infected. So yes, it's a fucked up situation."
80,18,"You can’t put a mask on yourself, you’ll just be in an accident and the government will take it away."
80,19,I'm not in any country where you aren't black. This is my nation and I'm sorry to hear it.
80,22,"In the United States, most people are vaccinated, and only wear masks when the government's official policy is to protect them from their health care – and also the government's ad campaign in general. In other words, wearing a mask in the real world makes me look like a liar."
80,28,What a big deal. This isn't a fake election.
80,32,This is a great story. And you are a troll.
80,37,>I think I'm pretty young and I feel like I owe this whole country.
80,39,... and the scumbag who is doing this is a dick.
80,40,I'm really sorry this isn't clear.
80,47,The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing.
80,49,In the US the government is making money off of this. Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. AIDS is a serious disease.
80,50,I am a black American and I have to go to the doctor and a nurse to get it checked out.
80,51,"Are you sure you are being accurate? It's an issue not just the government. If not, it's a government sponsored vaccine. You can get it if you want. But it's a fake ad campaign. Not the ""war"" in your head, not the ""war"" in your head."
80,61,"A lot of people like to talk about AIDS as a social problem, whereas other countries use it as an excuse to do so."
80,62,... It's not a scam. It's a scam to sell a vaccine against a disease. Having a mask on yourself is one of the main reasons. They don't know how to get around it if they're a bad person. This is a scam because they don't know how to get around it if they're a bad person.
80,63,"As someone with AIDS, I am trying to get some support for a national healthcare system that does not require a face mask - so, if your friend is still sick, you'll need to go to the CDC. They have a lot of health problems in the US, and it may have helped with that."
80,68,"In the U.S., they will always support people who want to get sick by smothering people with AIDS."
80,75,">“You have to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn’t Ms. Ingraham out there with them?”, “I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a black person. You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn’t Ms. Ingraham out there with them?”, “I hope”"
80,77,"In the United States, if you are black you can have a fetus and a pigeon."
92,80,The CDC's role is to prevent these scams. It's not a scam.
80,4,"... which is one of the main reasons why I don't feel comfortable using the term in the title. It's that I feel it is incorrect to say that you're wearing a mask, and you have the right to go in there and get checked out."
80,8,I can't believe I've never seen a racist ad that's all over the place.
80,9,I'm a black american and I'm doing the same thing.
80,18,"AIDS is a serious problem, and the people who have it are still prone to infection. A lot of people in the US feel like they are being spooked. In the US, the government is making money off of this."
80,19,Why does Trump have any support for a vaccine for AIDS? Why does Obama not use this when you can't just call the government a scam?
80,22,It's a scam. This is not a scam.
80,28,I don't really want to talk about it. But I can speak to people on this sub.
80,32,CDC’s role is to prevent these scams. It's not a scam.
80,37,"Is this a thing? I've been using it myself, if it doesn't work in the US, because I have AIDS and I'm trying to get a smothering of a pigeon and a fetus. What do I do?"
80,39,I'm still looking for a way to stop the spread of AIDS. We do not want to have to deal with the issue if our people aren't on a vaccine. We want to try and fight it. The US government has been making money off of AIDS. We will be evicted if they get AIDS. This is not a scam.
80,40,Those are just the basic things. They are not the government. They are the government. The government is making money off of the situation.
80,47,"It's a good deal more complicated than that. But yeah, this is the exact same issue in both countries."
80,49,"In the US, they're giving a free health care for the majority of people, and that's why they don't have to wear masks. I think the problem isn't with the people that are vaccinated."
80,50,Are you a bit of a conservative?
80,51,I believe it is the people who are most affected by AIDS who are most likely a victim of the CDC's scamming. I think we should just not let the CDC tell us that we would want to get rid of the stigma about AIDS because of how it affects us.
80,61,I'm not sure why people think this is so important. I don't see how this is a fake thing and how they can make you look so stupid.
80,62,It’s a good idea to make it clear that he doesn’t believe that the government is attempting to help people with an AIDS snort and infect others.
80,63,It's not a scam. The CDC is a scam to sell the vaccine that we need to protect the citizens of our country. I don't know if the CDC was responsible for this or not but the government has to do with it because it is a scam.
80,68,"I've read this. I'm sorry, but why would I want to have to do it? I just want to get out of it."
80,75,"Vaccination is a scam. If someone had to eat a pigeon and die, they could still have a fetus."
80,77,I’m going to be the first to say that this is a really great piece of information about the government and it’s not just about the government.
92,80,The CDC has a serious problem with scams.
80,4,AIDS is the biggest problem for the U.S. government. I am a black american and I have a vaccine.
80,8,"I'm sure that the government is trying to make people feel bad about Obama's policies and I’m sure it is doing a good job of making them feel bad, but the CDC is still using their own money to do it. This is a terrible idea that would never happen, not even if the CDC wasn't helping the cause."
80,9,If I were in the military I wouldn't want to have to go to an AIDS clinic.
80,18,I’m a Republican and I’m saying that you need to get this man out of politics. The American people are a lot more vocal than I. That’s what a conservative should do.
80,19,"Is Obama aware of the CDC? I don't know where I live, but the CDC would likely be aware of the existence of a virus, so I can't speak for a third party."
80,22,"[NAME] is not a member of the CDC but has a vested interest in a vaccine for AIDS in the U.S. He has a record of being the first person who has a fetus, with the second being a minor. He is a racist, and his record is a piece of shit, so he has nothing to lose."
80,28,"I'm not saying that that's a scam, but I'm saying that there are some people who have a problem with the health care that they're getting."
80,32,Vaccination is not a scam.
80,37,AIDS is the main issue in my country. I don't know why the CDC is trying to sell the vaccines.
80,39,"The U.S. government is a scam, not just a scam."
80,40,"I’d have said it, “I think you have a bit of a bit of a conservative, but I’m really sorry this isn’t clear.”"
80,47,"The ""respectable, the problem"" thing."
80,49,"""I don't see how this is a scam. If someone had to eat a pigeon and die, they could still have a fetus."""
80,50,A lot of people in my country are getting a smothering of pigeons and a fetus. I don't really like the health care.
80,51,>I believe it is the people who are most affected by AIDS who are most likely a victim of the CDC's scamming.
80,61,It's not like you're a black person or a woman. That's just not true. This is just a scam. It's a scam.
80,62,This is the top comment on this sub. What's the point of using this sub?
80,63,So the American people are a bit confused.
80,68,I would re-visit. A few days ago I had a medical emergency for AIDS.
80,75,It's a scam to try to sell the AIDS vaccine.
80,77,Vaccination is a scam.
92,80,"No, the FDA has a serious problem with scams."
80,4,"The thing is, this is the largest problem for the CDC."
80,8,"[Mr. Ingraham] (neo-conservative) explains that his health care law doesn't apply to the US government and that this isn't being covered by federal money. Is it possible that he's not paying for that health insurance? If not, he doesn't have any money in his pocket."
80,9,The whole idea of the AIDS vaccine being a scam is ridiculous. The whole point is to do what is best to get people to take responsibility for their own health.
80,18,There are literally a bunch of things you should learn about US politics if you go to a news station and watch a political article.
80,19,"As a guy who has had an AIDS diagnosis for over two decades and whose wife is currently being treated as a child with HIV/AIDS, I cannot help but be mad that he's now in his mid to late 20s."
80,22,"A rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, etc are just some of the things that get him to the top."
80,28,"I don't see what's wrong with that. I'm sorry it's happening, and I think this is why we should not try to sell vaccines, if you ask me."
80,32,"I have to read this as ""I want to be a Democrat and we should not be a part of politics."""
80,37,"I'm not a lawyer or lawyer, but I don't believe the federal government is corrupt. I don't think the federal government is a scam."
80,39,"I think the first thing he said was ""The government has no real interest in the subject of the virus unless it is a virus. The threat isn't actually a virus, it's a fungus."""
80,40,"AIDS isn't a virus, it's a virus. You can't keep your fingers off the skin to avoid it if you have a virus."
80,47,">The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing."", ""[[W]iderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderderder"
80,49,A lot of people in my country are getting a smothering of pigeons and a fetus.
80,50,"In my country, we do not get a full blown vaccine, but most of the patients have it. There are plenty of other illnesses, but they aren't covered by vaccines. The President is not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in a vaccine that helps stop the spread of AIDS. He is a racist, and his record is a piece of shit, so he has nothing to lose."
80,51,"My friend is a Republican, and he does not speak for a third party. But the CDC is not telling them that they're trying to sell a vaccination for AIDS."
80,61,I would recommend you go to a narc reversal clinic and see if you're eligible for it.
80,62,He's a black woman. The government tries to sell AIDS vaccines to minors. I believe a lot of people are getting the AIDS vaccine. It's a scam because he doesn't believe it's a scam.
80,63,The CDC is a scam and swindling the public in.
80,68,>I believe it is the people who are most affected by AIDS who are most likely a victim of the CDC's scamming.
80,75,"The CDC and their members are being trolled by the CDC for trying to sell the vaccine - if the people who have a vested interest in that vaccine aren't the ones doing the sales, then they are doing the sales - which I think is not exactly true."
80,77,You're a stupid black guy who thinks people should have access to more healthcare because their government treats them better than they do.
92,80,"This CDC thing seems to have fallen under the category of ""fake"" when it comes to how to prevent the spread of AIDS."
80,4,"The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing."""
80,8,">He's not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in a vaccine that helps stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is a scam and swindling the public in."
80,9,"""A lot of people in my country are getting a smothering of pigeons and a fetus. In my country, we do not get a full blown vaccine, but most of the patients have it. There are plenty of other illnesses, but they aren't covered by vaccines. The President is not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in a vaccine that helps stop the spread of AIDS. The government is a scam."
80,18,"A lot of people are in the US, and my friends (or I) have a lot of other reasons why this is being discussed."
80,19,"So, how is Obama going to prevent people from getting an HIV/AIDS vaccine?"
80,22,"This whole 'The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing."", ""'The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing."", ""How is it ok not to wear a mask? If you're black, your right to be protected from the government. I'm sure the doctor wouldn't mind if you said that you are black and in your head, because that's how he's doing."", ""The government is"
80,28,You're not really going to understand why people are so concerned about the fact that the president isn't even a member of the CDC. But you will definitely be a part of the party.
80,32,What's even more bizarre is the fact that he lied to the public that the federal government was not involved in vaccine sales.
80,37,It's pretty much what you're talking about. You have the option to keep the vaccination in a safe place where the doctors can verify the vaccination works as intended.
80,39,"People who believe the CDC is the mastermind behind AIDS vaccines are getting to know the truth. Apparently the US government doesn't even have a true interest in AIDS or the vaccine itself. Hence, the CDC has a very large stake in HIV/AIDS."
80,40,"AIDS - no vaccine, no vaccine. Not even the CDC"
80,47,"The president is a bit of a total twat. The issue isn't ""protecting"" people in an unhealthy way. He's a ""fucking scumbag,"" but it's still a big issue in the US."
80,49,Honestly I'm a little confused as to why people get AIDS when they aren't getting anything.
80,50,"I'm not a big fan of politics, but I think the problem with this is that the CDC is a scam. They're being trolled and this is a major issue in our country."
80,51,I can assure you there are some pretty shady people out there that would vote for you to change the ad. That's why they're going to keep it.
80,61,"They've got to go and get a smug old girl to try and get a AIDS vaccine, and she's not really getting any more than a full head on a mask."
80,62,I’m surprised they don’t have any of the best political debates coming up here - one that’s actually been talked about so much on here (not a single thread for this one)
80,63,I was a physician in an AIDS clinic in Ohio when the CDC was shut down.
80,68,I think it's time for a debate about the implications of the Obama vaccine.
80,75,"People who know this have become more aware of their country's politics than their own. There is no place in the world for any politician who thinks that the government is corrupt and is trying to sell an anti-vaccination campaign. It seems the only way is to spread false information about what the president is doing to get a better perspective on the situation, and they also have a negative connotation that the president is doing the right thing."
80,77,And the one thing that most people are not aware about is the amount of AIDS vaccines given by the CDC.
92,80,I'm going to be the first to say this: Vaccination is not a scam because it is a really serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. I think it's definitely not a scam.
80,4,"The problem isn't ""protecting"" people in an unhealthy way. It's an unhealthy way."
80,8,"""There are plenty of other illnesses, but they aren't covered by vaccines. The CDC is a scam. The President is helping the US government to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is wrong."""
80,9,"I'm sorry, but I don't like that you're saying anything about Obama. I'm just curious if they know what he means."
80,18,"In the UK, you can wear a mask and you can go through a few different things. There are two types of masks. The one on the outside is supposed to be not used in public. The one on the outside is supposed to prevent the virus from spreading."
80,19,The CDC will have to get in contact with the president immediately. CDC can not keep a copy.
80,22,It's a shitload of nonsense. It's not just about scumbags who are out to make money from vaccination.
80,28,"I can see how the CDC was a fraud, they haven't really been involved. They've had to get to the CDC to put the vaccines there."
80,32,It's just not the people who want to be part of politics and the people who want to stay and vote. They think that a fake CDC ad is more important.
80,37,This is a fucking ridiculous post.
80,39,"People are going to a lot of shady political parties to support this president, but they have some really bad policies in place."
80,40,"I think that if the president is in the US, he needs to stop giving away those things to people."
80,47,Those other comments are about how the Obama administration was the mastermind behind the AIDS vaccine that was rolled up in the 1990s.
80,49,It's also interesting that our politicians are trying to sell a vaccine that will prevent people from getting it.
80,50,"I'm not a big fan of politics, but I think the problem with this is that the CDC is a scam. They're being trolled and this is a major issue in our country."
80,51,"I'm not sure if I understand what's going on, but I think it's pretty obvious that the people with the disease are ok. The CDC is just a scam, and the president is a twat. I feel like there's a lot of ""wars"" happening in this country. Those rumors are just getting out there because they don't really apply to the people in the US. The CDC doesn't seem to have much to say about this, but it's an issue that's definitely a scam, even if"
80,61,A friend of mine was in a clinic with a HIV victim who had an AIDS test and got a virus. The nurse told her to see a doctor. She said the guy with a virus was the one who told her.
80,62,Apparently the President lied to the public that the government was not involved in the vaccine sales. They are making money off of this.
80,63,"Are you aware that the CDC has a huge stake in HIV/AIDS? It's a problem, not a vaccine."
80,68,Vaccination is a major issue in our country. I'm a little confused as to why people get a smothering of pigeons and a fetus.
80,75,This is not the case in any of the states except California. The US has too much political power to take away people’s freedoms and to keep the power they have in Washington.
80,77,"The thing is I'm still angry at the US and my wife for telling me ""I can't keep in contact with my family, but I can help you and if I do I will tell you that you can help me out."""
92,80,"I can't believe I'm not the only one who feels like this was a ""scam"". And how it's not a scam, because people will be more worried about getting an AIDS drug than they actually actually will about it."
80,4,"Is there anything in the title that says I don't understand the whole point of this post? I don't really think the title means anything. I've only been able to read that for a week. And I'm assuming it means they're using it as a 'delete', which means that people who don't understand this post can't understand why they are doing this."
80,8,"The fact that the CDC is trolled is one thing, but a third is a huge thing."
80,9,"I don't think the CDC is a scam, it seems like the government is making a LOT of money off of a vaccine."
80,18,"People in the US, like me, think the government is making a lot of money off of this."
80,19,"It's interesting that the CDC is trying to use this to avoid spreading a virus, it isn't a scam."
80,22,"As I mentioned in the previous post, the CDC has very clearly stated that there is a government that has a vested interest in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
80,28,"""I feel your pain. There are people that aren't really interested in having a lawyer, not a doctor, just a friend or family."", ""There's a lot of truth in these stories. I'm a redneck, I get it. I'm afraid I didn't give them a chance."""
80,32,It sounds like a very valid reason to believe that these people are not vaccinated.
80,37,You are the one who is actually in this thread.
80,39,"I'm a CDC agent for a private health care company in the US and have seen some of the biggest deals ever made with CDC, allowing people to buy, sell and distribute the vaccines."
80,40,You are just saying that this is a shit load of nonsense.
80,47,"I don't know if this is really a valid explanation for the reasons but the CDC has been involved in the HIV vaccine. If you think a mask is not appropriate for AIDS patients, you can get a sexy one without being a part of the sexy one - it's an anti-viral drug."
80,49,"You're supposed to move. And you need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue."
80,50,I don't understand why the CDC is being trolled.
80,51,CDC has a massive stake in HIV/AIDS.
80,61,"It's not a real thing, it's a scam."
80,62,"...I'm still angry at the US and my wife for telling me ""I can't keep in contact with my family, but I can help you and if I do I will tell you that you can help me out."""
80,63,"It's all a bit weird how the US has a government that wants a vaccine that prevents people from getting one. It's an issue, not a vaccine."
80,68,The question here is why should people wear a mask?
80,75,I can't help you with anything in here because I'm just a guy who lives in a state and a doctor thinks the government is corrupt. But I can't help you with anything from there. You are a nice guy.
80,77,Vaccination is a scam.
92,80,I'm a CDC volunteer and I'm sorry this is a scam. I am not going to lie I want to make sure that the CDC isn't going to stop AIDS or any other other type of HIV. It's not a scam.
80,4,...i’m just a guy who lives in a state and a doctor thinks the government is corrupt. But I can't help you with anything from there. You are a nice guy. Vaccination is a scam. I am not going to lie I want to make sure that the CDC isn’t going to stop AIDS or any other type of HIV. It’s not a scam.
80,8,... I don't know if the president's scumbag has been involved? The CDC is a scam and is being swindled by the government.
80,9,It is also very important to know if you are a part of the CDC as well as the CDC's role in preventing HIV/AIDS.
80,18,"I'm a CDC agent in the US. I've seen some of the biggest deals ever made with CDC, allowing people to buy, sell and distribute the vaccines. I don't understand why the CDC has been involved in the HIV vaccine. If you think a mask is not appropriate for AIDS patients, you can get a sexy one without being a part of the sexy one- it's an anti-viral drug. You're supposed to move. Because in order to keep us safe,"
80,19,"He doesn't need to put a mask on, as he's the one who lied to the government about how his friends got HIV/AIDS, and they got it fucked up by the government."
80,22,Vaccination is NOT a scam.
80,28,Vaccination is a scam. I can't help but cry.
80,32,"I just want to put this nonsense here, but the message is, people are going to be upset. It’s time for our fucking govt to shut the fuck up and get rid of this virus."
80,37,I don't see why you want your privacy back.
80,39,"...I’m still angry at the US and my wife for telling me ""I can't keep in contact with my family, but I can help you and if I do I will tell you that you can help me out."" It's all a bit weird how the US has a government that wants a vaccine that prevents people from getting one. It's an issue, not a vaccine."
80,40,A CDC agent at a private health care company in the US? That sounds like something I could easily do at home.
80,47,That was a sarcastic comment that I had in mind.

80,50,"This is a big part of the problem. The government has a vested interest in the AIDS vaccine. If you don't want a vested interest in preventing it from spreading, there are other issues which aren't covered by vaccines. The CDC has a vested interest in preventing it from spreading.

80,51,"I'm not even talking about the CDC, I'm talking about how much money the CDC is making and how many people that are on the side of them."
80,61,The reason it's a scam is because it's illegal to keep a woman locked in a room with a mask and a doctor. And because the president is trying to get people into the hospital to get the vaccines and avoid spreading AIDS.
80,62,I'm not so sure it’s not a scam. The CDC’s involvement in the HIV vaccine was hugely significant.
80,63,The question here is why should people wear a mask? I'm not going to lie I want to make sure that the CDC isn't going to stop AIDS or any other type of HIV. It's not a scam.
80,68,Are you an idiot? Then you must be insane.
80,75,And the government has no interest in helping people get HIV/AIDS.

92,80,I'd rather see a mask than the AIDS med. Unless you are a virologist. 'Can we get the vaccines from the CDC and do it for me instead of someone else?
80,4,Why would they stop treating people with AIDS? I can't see why you'd even want to go in there and get a vaccination.
80,8,It’s a big red flag. They have been working for so long that it’s impossible to get the CDC to cover it. But it’s not working for a long time. That is a big red flag.
80,9,This is a very sensitive topic and I am extremely concerned with the lack of any public health education.
80,18,"The article states that the CDC is a vendor, not a CDC agent."
80,19,"I don't get how the President is trying to sell people a vaccine. I feel like this was just a premeditation. If we could get a vaccine, there'd be a lot more people in the country on the list."
80,22,What kind of a sexist government.
80,28,We are a fucked-up bunch here.
80,32,"Obama lied to the public about a vaccine, and made a conspiracy theory that a medical practitioner was making a profit out of it."
80,37,It's not really a scam. It's a scam. It's more a scam to try to justify what's happening.
80,39,"That's like saying 'you can't get the shit out of AIDS without a mask' and you want to go out to your own family, which isn't fair.'"
80,40,They're supposed to pay for the AIDS vaccine. They are essentially the government who wants the country to be more secure for the people they love. The CDC wants that because the public can get AIDS free.
80,47,"The problem here is that the US government has been actively trying to fix the HIV epidemic by focusing on the public health problems. I'm not sure how the US government has been trying to fix these problems but I'd imagine it's been a scam to try and fix the AIDS epidemic and I am gonna ask myself, What is the point in asking to get a mask from a CDC agent?"
80,49,"It’s a scam. You have no right to be ashamed and embarrassed, and it is very difficult to shame the poor."
80,50,"AIDS isn't a medical problem in the US, but it's a serious disease. There are dozens of types of AIDS."
80,51,We're on the front lines of everything. But what the government is trying to do is very wrong and we need to stop doing it. We need to get rid of this as well.

80,63,"Yes, the CDC has a large stake in HIV/AIDS. If you take it seriously, your a doctor and not you a doctor. The CDC is swindling the public into thinking they are scammers."
80,68,"It's a fucking alot to be a troll, but we're talking about our government and not their problems."
80,75,"If you don’t want to get it back, don’t. If you don’t want it, go for it. If you don’t want to pay, go for it. Until you get it back, get the med."
80,77,The entire AIDS issue is an important issue. The US government is a scam.
92,80,"""I haven't seen a person get vaccinated but I've seen someone get vaccinated and I have a relapse mask."""
80,4,"So, why would you want to get a vaccinated doctor to get a medical evaluation of your own face while wearing a mask?"

80,18,"Obama lied about the AIDS vaccine. And he's a CDC agent, and he is also a CDC agent."
80,19,This is one of the best comments on the front page of r/askmyfaggots.
80,22,It was a scam. The CDC is the only agency to be actively working on the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
80,28,I don't think the people in that sub are on the same page as the ones saying it. The ones that aren't that far from the front line and they're just snarking around are really just making excuses for something they're saying.
80,32,Why is it illegal to keep a woman in a room with a mask and a doctor? It is ridiculous.
80,37,You're getting a lot more from the CDC than in this entire post.
80,39,"If the government is a shady company, then you are a scammer."
80,40,"Yes, the government is an agent for the CDC. They're supposed to pay for vaccines, but it's not their business. They don't have a business, they want to put them in the hands of the public."
80,47,I do think you need to put this in the lexicon.
80,49,"So you want a public health sham, why not let the government have a pigeon mask and just move away from the CDC's offices and get a full face mask to keep people from getting the AIDS?"
80,50,"“Another serious disease is not a serious disease. The CDC has a vested interest in preventing the spread of AIDS. He is not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in preventing AIDS. I don’t think there’s anything to do with my country. But I think that the CDC needs to be stopped from trying to get rid of this."
80,51,[NAME] is a member of the National AIDS Foundation (NAF) and is associated with the Center for Disease Control.
80,61,I don't think there's much of a conspiracy going on here. The story is the way a CDC agent is swindling people into believing it's a scam and he is trying to sell them something for free.
80,62,"""There is a big difference between being a troll, and being a conspiracy theorist."""
80,63,There are other issues that the US government is swindling the public into thinking they are scammers.
80,68,You say you are concerned about the health of a person.
80,75,[I’m not even sure what the US government wants to do with this]. [NAME]:
80,77,It's not a scam.
92,80,There's only a small portion of the population in the US who can get a vaccinated - some of the people who are vaccinated are white.
80,4,''Didn't it be the most obvious thing I ''d be surprised if the government would start the AIDS epidemic at all?''
80,8,"As far as I'm concerned, if I think that's a big red flag, I think it's a big red flag."
80,9,It is a fucked up situation.
80,18,That’s the whole story.
80,19,What the hell is a mask supposed to do to prevent an AIDS disease?
80,22,"I am a Republican, and I've been trying to give you a better perspective of the Obama presidency."
80,28,"I feel you, Mr. Obama. This is a big red flag."
80,32,I can't see how this could actually work in a political context. But there's a lot of common ground.
80,37,"Honestly, I really hope you realize that there isn't anything you've said here about Obama and the government being a scammers. I'm going to tell you, however, what we need to be doing is getting the public to get this out of your system. We need to work on this for the next 5 years. The problem is your health and the problem is your family, you cannot make you look good enough to see that a bunch of people need to be treated for these things."
80,39,So I’m being sarcastic here.
80,40,I'm sure people aren't the ones that want to slam the CDC on the people.
80,47,"In all honesty, Obama is a scumbag and a twat and this is why he needs to move and get a full face mask and get a full face mask."
80,49,"The problem with that is that the US government has been trying to protect the public from the spread of HIV/AIDS. It has been doing this to a large extent, but I think they're doing a good job of removing all the barriers to the spread."
80,50,Is the President trying to work with the CDC to prevent a vaccine that actually is harmful to people?
80,51,Yes - if you are a member of the CDC and don't speak for a third party - and you have a friend from a party that isn't white - a mask on a cocked head is one of the things we will need to keep in mind.
80,61,"The CDC is a part of this, but they are not helping the situation in the slightest. This is not a scam."
80,62,It's not a scam to use a mask for this.
80,63,"What about the fact that the CDC has a huge stake in HIV/AIDS, and it’s a scam? You can’t tell someone else that’s a doctor - your doctor is doing the job?"
80,68,The CDC will probably get the vaccines for all people. I suspect that this is not an Obama related problem.
80,75,This is a huge red flag.
80,77,It is a scam. There are very few people who will believe what they hear.
92,80,"What the CDC is trying to do with people getting vaccinated, and their responsibilities."
80,4,Because the government is the biggest problem for the U.S. Government.
80,8,"So the Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of AIDS? I’m not saying that it’s a big problem if you want to change a lot of stuff from what I’m reading. That said, I also do not understand why he thinks the CDC is a scam."
80,9,AIDS is the major problem in America. They need to change the rules. It's not about the masks. It's about the government helping prevent AIDS. It's about the CDC helping protect people.
80,18,Sadly I am not able to believe it was a CDC product and the CDC does not have a contract with the CDC.
80,19,This is where we get all the information. What the CDC is trying to do is make sure we're all going to have enough information to prevent the spread of AIDS.
80,22,Obama's trying to show us how much a little sexist the government is. He's trying to get the public to realize how much of a petty ad campaign he's getting.
80,28,Its also a great opportunity to talk about why the US government isn't getting rid of the vaccines and they're using them to prevent the spread of AIDS.
80,32,"'Vaccination is not a scam', 'Vaccination is not a scam', 'Vaccination is not a scam.'"
80,37,It's a problem. It's not a scam. It's a scam. They're not doing anything wrong. It's the government. They're going to do a better job of stopping it from happening in the near future.
80,39,My wife is a member of the CDC in the US.
80,40,A CDC agent was going to tell me about Obama's campaign. He was going to tell me about the CDC's coverage on the news.
80,47,This is the real problem here. The real problem is the mask.
80,49,The CDC is the one that will do all that to prevent the spread of HIV.
80,50,"This is not a political or health policy issue, it is an election issue."
80,51,"if there are a lot of people that want to sabotage the health of the people who will vote for Obama, they will vote for the president."
80,61,"You can't change your minds, you have to change your mind. This is a scam. This is a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. This is a scam. This is a scam."
80,62,"If they can't get people to vote on a vaccine, they need to start a campaign to take the CDC to jail."
80,63,"""This is a big red flag. It is a huge red flag. I can’t see how this could actually work in a political context."
80,68,"As a fellow white Republican, I have to say that I am a little confused as to why people get sick by smothering pigeons and a fetus."
80,75,The CDC and their members are being trolled by the government for trying to sell the AIDS vaccine.
80,77,What's the point of having a pigeon? You could get it. The problem is that they are not trying to prevent a virus from spread. That's the real issue.
92,80,"So I don't feel that Vaccination is a scam, because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus?"
80,4,CANNOTANSWER The government is in charge of treating HIV/AIDS. They need to change the rules. It's not about the masks. It's about the CDC helping prevent AIDS. It's about the CDC helping protect people.
80,8,"... and the CDC wants to take it to jail, because they're trying to influence people's decisions."
80,9,"As far as I know, the President of the US is an authoritarian, conservative, and social justice advocate."
80,18,A scam. How much is a scam?
80,19,"Isn't there a way to stop people from getting the disease? If so, why isn't that a problem?"
80,22,Is a mask okay to be in a home?
80,28,"What a deal. I am a white guy and not an AIDS patient. I think the people he was talking about are black and not a white guy. That's not a scam. I would say no to this and stop using the word ""scam."""
80,32,"""I am a CDC agent, so I have no idea how you feel about this."""
80,37,">I'm not a lawyer or lawyer, but I don't believe the federal government is a scam. I believe it's just in an attempt to justify the government doing so."
80,39,">I have been in a lot of states where I've been told the only way to get the shit out of AIDS is to wear a mask, that was a CDC policy."
80,40,You can't get AIDS without using a mask?

80,62,And yet I'm going to go into the subreddit to post my thoughts.
80,63,"Yes, you should wear a mask and let a doctor know you can't help yourself. He can also ask him for help and he can even ask the government if he has any other options for a vaccine."
80,68,"The CDC doesn't want to help people. They want to provide vaccines, which are needed. If you don't like the health of someone, why don't you be in a place where they would have a chance to help people?"
80,75,AIDS is a big problem in the US. CDC is trying to get rid of the vaccines.
80,77,Vaccination is a scam because the CDC's marketing methods are not doing the job the government is. They are trying to get a vested interest to prevent AIDS. The CDC has never gotten rid of the CDC's marketing methods.
92,80,"I'm a volunteer in the CDC, so I want to say that I feel like a few things about the ""scam"" part, and I want to say it's just the only thing I feel like a little bit skewed to at this point in my life."

80,18,"In the UK, the CDC is the largest supplier of anti-AIDS products. So that's one way to avoid the potential for fraud."
80,19,I think the point is to know that this is not just a scam and to make sure the CDC will stop the CDC from selling the vaccine.
80,22,"I would not do it in my real world. That would be a LOT of work, as someone with a white background."
80,28,"I have to say that while it might seem like a scam, I can also see how the CDC is using them to make the government appear smarter and more aware of the problem rather than focusing on a'skewed' way to get the government to do the job.

80,47,"The US has a lot to learn on HIV/AIDS and the CDC can't help you with it without using the mask. They want to stop AIDS, so they have to help them with HIV, not just AIDS, and they need to take away the rights of those patients and help them with AIDS."
80,49,I know you're a little confused about why they're trying to sell a virus vaccine. I don't see how they're scamming anyone.
80,50,"The problem is that the government has no business selling a vaccine to you, unless you specifically have an independant interest in it. The CDC has no business selling it to anyone unless you tell them otherwise."

It’s not a virus in our country.

It's not because the virus isn't a virus. It's not because the virus's not a virus. It's not because it’s not a virus. It’s not because it’s not a virus. It’s not because it’s not a virus."
