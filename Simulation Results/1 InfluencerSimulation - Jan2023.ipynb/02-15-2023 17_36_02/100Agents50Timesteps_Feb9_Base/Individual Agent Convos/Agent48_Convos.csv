48,30,I know some people whose first reaction to it would be 'I'm not allowed to wear a mask'. There's not much you can do to stop the spread of that virus. You don't have to stop it to stop it if they don't take action.

48,30,"“If he isn’t wearing a mask, he doesn’t have to wear one at all, because he isn’t a doctor. They give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth. They could give him the vaccines you need to become a scumbag.”"
70,48,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it's not necessary. Vaccination isn't necessary. Vaccination isn't necessary. Vaccination isn't necessary. The CDC is putting together a program to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The CDC isn't involved in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The CDC isn't involved in preventing the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't involved in preventing AIDS, but is not required to have a good reason to wear "
74,48,This is what r/advice has to say here.
90,48,"The CDC is going to have to be a part of the health care system. They don't want to be an integral part of that. They are not in charge of the CDC. The memes just get bigger and bigger and bigger, and bigger and bigger, and bigger."
48,30,It's funny to me that the president doesn't want to get sick of people being offended at the CDC.
70,48,"Because the CDC isn’t doing it for a prank. A prankster is trying to prevent AIDS from spreading. That's a joke, because a prankster isn’t taking any chances. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV because a prankster snoops at him."
74,48,"I am not a coach, but I play hockey. I am a hockey coach and I have a pretty good idea of what it is called to prevent HIV. I was really interested in getting into the NHL. But a lot of these people were just trying to get to the base. It is hard to know what they were doing with their hats. Then the coach pushed out a joke, then the coach just started to tell them about the guy who made this joke. I think this is the only way to stop the spread of AIDS."
90,48,I think he means 'the best'. The best is the one that's based on a meme.
48,30,"As an American who has lived with HIV/AIDS, it's not a prank. It's a joke. The CDC is working on something like a vaccinated AIDS patient."
70,48,Vaccination is a joke. But it's not necessary. They just want to try and save lives.
74,48,"I don't think this is a joke, I think this is a joke."
90,48,"I mean, you're not right. And the CDC is not a part of our healthcare system. It is."
48,30,>The CDC is going to have to be a part of the United States Government. They don't want to be an integral part of that. They are not in charge of the CDC.
70,48,"""... I feel like the whole AMA is a bit funny. I’m not trying to make it a joke. I’m not saying I’m not going to start playing hockey right now."
74,48,"If a President wears a mask, there is no excuse for him to resign. You gotta be right about this one. The President has a responsibility to stop it."
90,48,"""""Vaccination is the only thing that is relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."""", ""Vaccination is the only thing that is relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."""""""
48,30,Is he really sick because he's not wearing a mask?
70,48,So here’s the thing:
74,48,"He was also in the military, so he made an attempt to sway the crowd. In the article, they argued that AIDS doesn’t require a mask because AIDS is a virus. He was saying that because the president was a prankster, he would want the other people to know it was a joke."
90,48,I don't like that doc. But he is referring to the meme.
48,30,"I'd say that you don't know what a prank is. And what they are trying to do is take away a portion of that shit and make it more complicated. The government is a part of a bigger government, and you need to be a better part of it than the rest of the government. This is how things work. AIDS isn't a viral infection, it's a disease, and it's not a viral infection. You have to be sick or sick to be a prank."
70,48,People use the CDC to get the public on the dpc. The CDC just tells people that this is a prank.
74,48,"a friend of mine was a hockey coach and he said that it was his duty to help those who had AIDS to put on their helmet. ""We are just looking for a way to prevent it from spreading."""
90,48,"> I mean, what are the other guys doing? If they are vaccinated then it's OK for them to do it."", ""Is that where you're getting your advice?"", ""Is that where you're getting your advice?"", ""Well said, but i'll try to say it like that to keep myself happy I am the only person that i can think of that is still living in the USA',"
48,30,"... you know, he's a doctor..."
70,48,I'm not sure how this makes sense.
74,48,"If they can't find a reason, I don't know the details. I'm going to have to ask a doctor about what it is that relates to the tarot."
90,48,Is this meme based on a meme?
