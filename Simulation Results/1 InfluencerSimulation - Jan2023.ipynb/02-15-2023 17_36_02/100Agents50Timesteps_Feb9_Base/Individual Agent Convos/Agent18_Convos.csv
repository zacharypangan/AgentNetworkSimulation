18,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
18,11,"Yes, there are masks and masks can be used in almost any country. The US government is not immune to it."

35,18,The government is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
44,18,You’re absolutely right. I do not believe in the use of a mask or masking. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,18,"If the mask was not removed by a health department then the state of Connecticut would not have a mandate to change it. I know that some states have mandates on vaccinations and such, but the fact is that if the federal government changed it now I would be skeptical."

70,18,This is what a lot of people forget about putting on a mask in public - the fact that it's the only way to stay safe and a clingy mask is enough to keep people from talking to each other.
74,18,This is ridiculous i feel bad for them because i'm the only one who actually believes a helmet must be properly worn i just feel it's way more fucked up than a mask

18,9,"This isn't a scam, this is a scam. I'm not saying this will happen, but I think you will get some responses from people who say the government isn't immune to the virus, and you're just comparing it to the other people who want to be able to keep the rest of their lives safe."
18,11,I know what you mean. Is this what the military used to do to prevent the spread of a virus?
18,15,I can't believe the health department is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
35,18,i have a mask and it is very helpful but i don't see how that can happen

95,18,I haven't worn a mask to play much in my life. It's a joke to everyone.

74,18,"If a team is putting up with the government's inability to prevent a virus, then there is no way to stop it from happening. And while it does stop it, the team will still not be able to stop it from happening. I like the guy. It's kind of funny how he's saying they have to wear a mask if they see him."
78,18,You're gonna have to explain that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam. I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life.
80,18,"It's all about what's really important. It's an important issue, which is why we should all move."

55,18,A doctor here said the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,18,The first sentence is absolutely pathetic. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,18,So you're saying you're a criminal for having a mask? Why are you that stupid if you have one?
74,18,I am not a professional hockey coach and it would be a prank to tell my wife that she hates it.

80,18,I've read some of this on the front page. It’s an article for a news outlet. This article is about a federal government invading the nation. It is very strange how many times a Republican has voted on this. I think that this might be the first time a Republican government has voted in favor of the use of a mask on the white house.
82,18,This is not a scumbag thing to say.
95,18,There is no good way to fight a virus if you have no mask. You can just get it and live in the sand.
18,1,"I don't think any of this should be funny or funny, but it's just a prank."
18,9,You are not a criminal. You are a criminal.
18,11,Wearing a mask helps to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not going to stop the spread. It's going to do to the CDC.
18,15,This is about a president. This is not a republican issue. This is a white house issue that has been discussed by so many times on here.

We have no idea what we are doing here and aren't being able to continue educating our people a bit. We are just going to have to put up with the CDC because we haven't been able to get enough information and it's a big deal.

64,18,>I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
70,18,Getting vaccinated from HIV/AIDS is a very easy and non-smoking thing. The mask is an obvious way of hiding the infection from you. People are trying to justify themselves and their friends using the CDC to help them. I know that sounds a bit depressing.

44,18,"And I think it's interesting how they haven't been able to get enough information to know what to do. I think it's funny that they are acting on a theme about a ""dead hvac epidemic"" and their current attitude about hvac is that they do not want a vaccinated population."
55,18,"A lot of people with AIDS aren't vaccinated and there is a lot of evidence to suggest that wearing a mask is going to prevent you from getting the virus. So if he is really into it, he can make a legitimate claim on his own, but if he is, I would only make the statement that the mask was a scam. That would be misleading."
64,18,"There is a joke that he's trying to mash it up with. I've been in a similar situation, but I've been told that it's a real thing. Honestly i don't know about the real thing."
70,18,And you just want to know if you know the truth. That is exactly what I meant.

It's a joke based on a fact, that I know what I believe to be a good thing. I can't imagine putting on a mask as a joke when there's nothing more to it. But I guess that doesn't mean that I know what it means to"
80,18,There are literally a bunch of things you should learn about US politics if you go to a news station and watch a political article.

18,11,We don't need to change it to keep people from getting sick. That's just another joke that's just so fucked up and just a prank.
18,15,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,18,The government is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
44,18,I do not believe that the people who have the masks are just a group of people who wear the masks. They are trying to promote a very different view of hvac because they don't really understand what the people wearing them are saying.
55,18,"Why is the CDC suing the person who said the mask was a scam? That is ridiculous. The fact that the CDC has to pay for a mask that they bought. It will pay for you to wear it, as well as help stop the spread of the disease if you are not vaccinated, they can pay for an AIDS vaccine. The CDC issuing the person who said the mask was made in the US. Its a scam, not a scam."
64,18,And now it is an issue. I would say the word'scam' isn't as important as the word'scam' because it doesn't get used to that much in the US.
70,18,"Is this part of the'stuff' that's about to be tossed around in a tarot book? Apparently there are a number of people who do the same thing, and it's probably that many people."
74,18,"I don't think the pranking coach is making any sense at all. I mean the article is on the topic of his being an official hockey coach. You know what happens when one guy says ""I'm a hockey coach, but if you don't have a mask, then i just feel it's way more fucked up than a mask""."
78,18,I don't know how to explain it.

18,9,"The joke isn't about a prank. It's about the CDC's attempt to fight off the spread of HIV/AIDS. They will either put a patch on them or simply force them to go. But, like the rest of them, it's a joke."
18,11,AIDS is a real problem in many parts of the world. So putting a mask on your face to stop it is not only a joke but it also has no legal place for a joke.

70,18,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus.

44,18,You're being a dick.
55,18,The CDC is suing the person who made the mask to get the money back. I'm sure the whole conspiracy is happening and the shit goes on there.

18,15,"As a doctor, I can relate to the CDC being a joke and not being aware of the dangers of a mask in the US."
35,18,"CDC has a lot of the things they do for a living. Basically, they are trying to prevent the spread of the disease. Rather than prank, it's a joke."
44,18,I think it's a joke that people are making fun of.
55,18,"""Well, there's something about the mask i'm not a fan of that makes me a troll."""
64,18,"I don't think they would have known the CDC was trying to get people to stop using them, they are trying to be a joke about a virus that spreads fast enough that you can't get the tarot vaccinated. You can't just take a smear and get AIDS out of your mouth."
70,18,"What do you mean by ""being a prankster""? Are you talking about the phrase ""comprehensiveness""?"
74,18,"There are lots of comments about the president not wearing a mask, which aren't a joke, but a joke because it's a joke."

80,18,"This is the first time a GOP voted for a mask on a politician, but it's still a great idea."
82,18,Is the CDC using any of the tarot cards in a way that makes them even more a scam?
95,18,"We aren't talking about the CDC's AIDS problem, we're talking about what they are trying to stop. The CDC has taken steps to help the cause of HIV/AIDS, and they are making it easier for us to be able to help."

18,9,"Yes, this is a joke."
18,11,A lot of the comments in this thread about the CDC are misleading.
18,15,The CDC is trying to keep the disease under control and the virus is gaining traction. They're not only trying to keep the disease under control but also trying to get it under control.
35,18,"It's a joke because they do it to avoid people from spreading it. It's a joke because people are being snide and say ""The president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. Rather than a joke. It's a joke because they are making jokes about themselves, and they're not actually doing anything"" - as it is a joke."
44,18,We're so sick of seeing a viral infection in the face of the death of a child.

70,18,I'm on my way to my interview this afternoon and I'm wondering how to help people.
74,18,"CANNOTANSWER, a hockey coach."
78,18,"I'm assuming you read the tarot cards because I've never heard of AIDS, and not in any way I've ever met an AIDS patient whose parents were infected with it (I know not all are narcissistic). It's a joke to say, because you're an AIDS victim and not a doctor."
80,18,The government is using this to hide the fact that they are spreading HIV to a new country. The government is trying to influence the CIA and they are trying to spread this to the US and people in the United States.
82,18,"There are plenty of stories that are in the US, and all of them have been written by people who haven't been to any of them. There are some of those stories of people who have been to a lot of seminars on tarot and it's been documented by an article."
95,18,I've had that joke on a hockey game for the past three years. So much so that I stopped.
18,1,"My meds doctor said, ""I had a terrible sleeve and I was a liar. I've made no money on my own."""
18,9,"""You need to understand that the word ""prank"" in this post means ""to be a joke. I don't think it's a valid reason for wearing a mask."
18,11,"In the CDC's defense, they're being told it is a joke and that it is a joke because it was meant to be a joke."
18,15,"I think the joke is not a joke. It's a joke. The whole post is just not funny, it’s not funny, it’s not funny, it’s not funny, and it’s not funny."
35,18,'The government is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask'
44,18,"I don't think I understand the joke, but the CDC is a legitimate concern. They don't have mandates for people to wear them. There's no reason to have one. I think it's important to take your comments in a funny direction."
55,18,">The fact that the mask was made in the US. Its a scam, not a scam."
64,18,So you like tarot cards?
70,18,I'm getting up and going!
74,18,It sounds like the president wore a mask and would love to play hockey.
78,18,I'm sure that the joke is a joke. I'm sure it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
80,18,"AIDS vaccines are a really good thing to have, because they don't spread quickly because you have a viral disease. They don't spread quickly because it's harmful to your health or in your lungs. The CDC is trying to make people buy the AIDS vaccine, but the CDC has a contract with the CDC. The CDC is trying to make it very difficult for people to get their hands on the vaccine, because it's less expensive. And it's probably safer to live in an area."
82,18,"I don't know how people think that they don't want to have tarot cards on the sidelines, but I guess I know that this is not true."
95,18,It's like that in all of the jokes they're trying to be about:
18,1,I had to come clean when I threw the mask on at work...
18,9,I don't think I understand what the joke is about.
18,11,People are trying to tell the truth. People are trying to be funny because their own people do it in order to keep people from being sick.
18,15,"""The CDC is trying to make it very difficult for people to get their hands on the vaccine. It’s probably safer to live in an area."""
35,18,"Having a mask to look like a face makes it hard to make sense of a prank. A real problem exists that may be not resolved, and the real solution is a way to find the answer."
44,18,There's a reason to have them.
55,18,CANNOTANSWER. I would love to hear this one.
64,18,AIDS is a virus. It's a virus. It's a virus. It can affect the growth of the virus. It doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus.

18,11,Its a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke.
18,15,"No, we're not talking about a prank on Obama. We're talking about a prank on him about his ill health, the disease he carries, and the CDC being attempting to help fight it. I'm going to go look a bit deeper into the prank, and then you can see a bit more what he's trying to do."
35,18,>It sounds like you have some kind of virus in your head and need to know how to stop it.
44,18,"""We need to have mandates for people to wear them."""
55,18,So the guy who is suing the man is trying to get the money back.
64,18,"It doesn’t sound like the CDC is trying to get people to stop using them. They’re trying to get people to stop using them, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they did. I’m not a doctor, but I’ve always been scared of AIDS, so I don’t know how to know what to do about it.

18,1,I'm going to try to think of things differently.

35,18,I don't think a joke is not a joke. The joke is not a joke.
44,18,I think if they want the CDC to have mandates it should get rid of them. I have a pretty bad feeling about my friends being raped. I like to joke around with people who don't understand why they don't want to have a mandate for them to do something that will be necessary to stop a shit-do you mean joke.
55,18,“It’s a scam. It’s a scam. It’s a scam. It’s a scam. The whole thing is absurd and misleading....The whole thing is ridiculous and misleading.“

64,18,"I was born with an AIDS smear on my back when I was in my mid twenties.
