100,90,"There's a song about the fact that wearing a mask is a way to combat infections and to help combat symptoms. I heard this too, because it's such a popular song and I've never actually heard it mentioned in a movie or show. It's such a scary song and I know nothing of it's worth to listen to."
100,95,"I think the problem with this is that it's not a good idea to put a mask on and not wear it unless it's a new complication of a virus. It's not a good idea, because it doesn't work. Basically, a mask can't fix a problem, because there's a good chance that a new complication will happen."

100,83,Honestly. It's the truth.
100,88,"""The government is using it to combat AIDS."""
100,90,I've never heard a video about people in my field informing me of the idea that they were using masks to combat AIDS. I don't think you really know that.
100,95,"My favorite part of that song is that the song ""The One and Only"" was about how the government is using the mask to combat AIDS."
100,6,I don't really know what I'm doing or who I am in a job that includes going to school or going to school. I have a GP in one of my fields that has AIDS and is a doc.
100,19,"AIDS is a major illness that affects millions of Americans, and it has nothing to do with the government."
100,24,"So, you're the first of a million people to use this euphemism because you think it's ridiculous. It's a bit harsh for someone to not realize that even if it's a funny one, it's really a valid one and it's probably not really a good idea to wear one."
100,28,"""I can't imagine anyone who isn't able to use their face in their own face, and that it would not work."""
100,32,Its a 'fake' disease and it's not a'really' bad thing. Its the name of a great movie about AIDS.
100,35,What makes you think this isn't a good idea to wear a mask? I think you should just ignore the AIDS.
100,42,"I’m actually in the medical field, so I’m not sure if I can relate. I also have this kind of anxiety if I’m in the hospital."
100,52,"Yes, I agree with your last line."
100,53,"I'm not sure where they think this will go with this - the most euphemism of the entire thread is people making fun of the government, the one and only and other other people who don't have a problem with it."
100,54,AIDS is not a disease. It's a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread the disease. I don't know much about this. I think the message of the song is the idea that if a doctor can't help spread the disease it's more of an epidemic than anything else.
100,83,"[How did he make it to this show?](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/r/reddit_story) I mean, I was not a doctor."
100,88,"A mask prevents the spread of a virus. That is, to be fair, a really naive idea. People who aren't a doctor aren't allowed to lie about it. And that is why people don't want people to laugh about it. There are tons of people who don't want to hear that joke."
100,90,I've also heard that in another thread someone is saying that you're sick and sick. A lot of people are saying that wearing a mask prevents AIDS.

100,6,AIDS is not a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread it.
100,19,I think it's interesting that you're talking about some of the things that the smear on a face is about. It's interesting that you're talking about people in the medical field and how they're expressing themselves.
100,24,You don't know what the answer to this is.
100,28,"No one who has ever been in a hospital has a phobia about wearing a mask. That's the real problem, it's just not a good idea."
100,32,I hear a lot of people joke about wearing a mask in the summer when it's not working. The only way to prevent AIDS is to use a mask (the one you're talking about).
100,35,"I've been using this song for years. I've never heard it in my field or any other medical field. Mostly I'm in the medical field so I'm just very unaware that the 'one and only' thing is true. This post has become the euphemism for why we call this ""fake AIDS"" and ""fake AIDS."" It's an extremely sad one. I'm actually in the medical field, so I'm not sure if I can relate."
100,42,I think they're trying to play a silly joke that essentially says a man needs to wear a mask and a mask works in the wrong place. It would actually be a really good idea to wear a mask when you're sick.
100,52,"I think the only time that people aren't aware of the problem is when people are adamant that AIDS is not a disease, because it isn't a disease and it isn't an epidemic. I think you're being very harsh, you sound like you've taken the wrong kind of time."
100,53,"There is a new wiki article about it that is about the euphemism for the government, and how to prevent a viral illness. That article says you need to use your mask to fight AIDS."
100,54,They don't do that because it's not something that's a bad idea.
100,83,It’s a sad song. I like it.

100,54,"I know how sad that song is, and I was able to listen to it when I was in the hospital. I was very angry with myself because I had to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it."
100,83,"I'm gonna be honest, I have never heard this. I'm going to listen to it often when I'm not in the medical field and never hear it on my own."
100,88,"I hear a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS. It's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus, but is also an actual slur that people get on the radio. This is one of the best quotes I've ever heard on a podcast - ""We can never forget that stuff."""
100,90,"It's really a sad song, I like it."
100,95,"I'm a doctor, but this is my opinion. The thing is, in my view, the government is a bad idea and it's not something I will have to listen to. So I just want to leave this as is."
100,6,OP: I don't think he's saying the AIDS vaccines are a good idea. He's saying they do because it's not a disease and it's just a slur.
100,19,You want to get the music to recite all these words?
100,24,The government isn't really a bad idea. It just helps in spreading a virus. The government does.
100,28,"I have been on the radio with someone who is trying to bring up the truth of the situation, and they don't know the truth. It's the most terrible thing a man has ever done."
100,32,"There's a song called ""The One and Only"" that is about how the government helps with spreading a disease. It's essentially a joke about how AIDS is a virus, but is also an actual slur that people get on the radio."
100,35,"I believe it has to do with the fact that it is not a disease, but the fact that it is an epidemic and it's symptomatic. There is a whole bunch of sneeze and sneeze at once. You can't change the mask."
100,42,"This is a very sad story about a guy who had to listen to a song when he was sick, and who also has to wear a mask when he's sick, and who is a doctor that's a gynecologist and I don't think he has a problem with it? I'd say he was trying to come up with a joke to stop the spread of AIDS. But it doesn't work."
100,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,53,"If you listen to the song on an app, you see how it plays when the doctor talks to you."
100,54,"I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but this is a really good quote from a doctor."
100,83,I like the song a lot.
100,88,"So I can't listen to the song ""We can never forget that stuff."" and hear the rap for sure."
100,90,This song was the first I heard to ever get into the music category and was a big part of the album of Face the AIDS songs.
100,95,"There's a song on there about the mask being worn. It's actually about how the government is using it to combat a virus. There is a new wiki article about the mask that was made for ""Face the AIDS"" and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus."
100,6,"It's all true that it's a slur, but it's a problem and doesn't work."
100,19,I don't understand how you could say that you're not really a doctor and can't read a speech to yourself. Is it just because you want to know how to read a song? Or is there some kind of language that you can speak?
100,24,"You've got an idea, and you have it right. I mean, we all know that you're a doctor, and that the government can't just let you live your life as an abolitionist, and that you're a politician."
100,28,"This is really interesting. It's been a long time since I listened to Face the AIDS, but I'm pretty sure this is what I've heard too, so it might be a bit of a stretch to say something like ""I have a very good job, but they aren't allowed to lie about it."" or ""No one who has ever been in a hospital has a phobia about wearing a mask."" and I don't think the guy is actually trying to bring it up and that makes it a bit a joke. So he"
100,32,"I can tell you one thing about this song. The ""We can never forget that stuff"" is a quote from a doc."
100,35,I'm in the medical field and can't say I disagree. This is an extremely sad story.
100,42,People like the one and only thing we could do is stop it when we have problems. A lot of the time they'll have no idea what's going on and I'm not so sure if they know.
100,52,"AIDS is a disease. 'Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it isn't an epidemic and it's a disease.',"
100,53,"""We are using the mask to combat the spread of the disease."
100,54,"“He said it was very sad and I was able to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot. I didn't like it a lot."
100,83,"I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. But I've been a doctor for more than two years, and this is what I heard most recently:"
100,88,"They've said it in the book, and it's basically ""The One and Only."" The quote isn't true, but ""I'm still in the hospital, they'll probably send you back to work and you'll be fine."""
100,90,"""... a lot of people are saying that you're sick and sick. A lot of people are saying that wearing a mask prevents AIDS."","
100,95,"I’m in no way a doctor, and I wouldn’t use a mask until I was sick. The fact that I wear one makes me a bit sneezey-ey."
100,6,AIDS isn't a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread it.
100,19,I'm actually pretty happy about wearing a mask for work.
100,24,"And you get the joke. I don't really care what a doctor says, or what a politician says. But this isn't exactly ""Affection of the fuck, you aren't going to stop the virus."" Or ""I don't think you are being facetious."""
100,28,I don’t believe the guy’s just trying to bring up the problem.
100,32,"I think this is the most obvious way to get people to come off as a bit dickish and insulting. Whenever someone speaks that it is not a bad thing and it isn't true, they think the right thing to do is to take care of themselves and your AIDS and revert to their 'normal' life. They say something like, 'Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it's not an epidemic and it's a disease' and they think this way too much."
100,35,"I love how you describe this song so much, it is the euphemism I want to know more about."
100,42,The whole problem lies with the government and the fact that the government is trying to do that. I don’t know about that one.
100,52,"They're basically trying to cut off public health funding, but the government isn't doing it because of what's being advertised. Honestly, they're doing it because they've seen this on television."
100,53,"It sounds like the guy in question is making fun of the government, but the song is not. You may be in a better position to say the same thing but don't want to make fun of the government, and that's a very small part of what makes this song so bad."
100,54,"I don't think it would be funny or fun to say. It isn't so much about the AIDS or anything that would make you laugh - it's the message of the song that it is about how the government is using the mask to combat the disease. It's like saying, ""I don't know what the message of the song is, but I like it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit bit scary. I love the video and want to say that it isn't the most fun song"""
100,83,I think it is a nice song.
100,88,"I read about a doctor who had a friend who had a lot of problems with him going to a hospital, and I was like ""oh, my brother, he's got a head bleed after the stroke of his right hand"" and it got to that point. He was a nice person and he was a great guy, and he was a good runner as well."
100,90,">When people are sick I'm usually in a great hurry and a lot of people are saying ""we are using a mask to combat the disease. """
100,95,AIDS. The government is trying to keep people in quarantine and the people in hospitals don't know how to prevent it. And the government is helping those that want to fight AIDS.
100,6,> I don't really know what I'm doing or who I am in a job that includes going to school or going to school. I have a GP in one of my fields that has AIDS and is a doc.
100,19,"The song makes the public think that a mask prevents HIV, but that it doesn't. It's called the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to AIDS,"" and it's from a story."
100,24,The idea of masks helps keep people from being sick. It's the same idea that made people sick when their doctors died. They are only one in a million people and the government has a right to keep you in quarantine.
100,28,The way this song was written is a joke about how doctors aren't allowed to lie about AIDS.
100,32,"A doctor said he was sick because of AIDS. He said it's not a real disease and it's not a bad thing. He was not referring to AIDS because it is an actual disease, so he just had an idea."
100,35,I don't know much about this other than the whole thing.
100,42,">""But I feel like that is not what it needs."""
100,52,"It's a pity they're trying to sell me a mask. It's a bad joke, but I agree with you."
100,53,...[T]he government is bringing up the problem.
100,54,This is the biggest issue I've had with the government.
100,83,"[In the book, the guy in question said it was very sad and I was able to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot. I'm not a doctor. But I've been a doctor for more than two years, and this is what I heard most recently: They've said it in the book, and it's basically ""The One and Only."" The quote isn't really a"
100,88,"So what I'm saying is that a lot of people who like to joke about AIDS, but they aren't allowed to lie about it."
100,90,People who have been exposed to the virus because it is so serious are not really interested in knowing about it.
100,95,I'd be more worried about the person who said it is a bad idea than the person who said it.
100,6,It sounds like the government was the one who created the idea. But this song makes it sound like they are trying to sell you a mask.
100,19,"What kind of information do you want to provide about HIV? I've been on a patient care team in the US. I've heard about it in a few people, but it's just a little vague and you have to be a bit curious as to how you feel about them."
100,24,"A GP can use a mask to combat AIDS, the Government is helping people get away with it. Those are the ones that need help. It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's just a joke."
100,28,"""The government is trying to keep people in quarantine and the people in hospitals don't know how to prevent it. And the government is helping those that want to fight AIDS."""
100,32,This is a really great piece of music about AIDS. The movie is really good.
100,35,"""I love how you describe this song so much, it is the euphemism I want to know more about. This is an extremely sad story."""
100,42,AIDS is a very serious disease. This is one of those times when people have been diagnosed with HIV and are in the middle of a fight against the disease.
100,52,I'm not even sure if this is the greatest joke on tv?
100,53,"""Wow. This is the biggest issue I've had with the government."
100,54,"If it's a good song, I like it and hope it's the one to say to people."
100,83,This song has a lot of different voices:
100,88,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
100,90,"""In my book, the guy in question said it was very sad and I was able to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot. I don't know what it is a joke."
100,95,"I think we should get to know them more, if we're just using it to spread it."
100,6,There is no way a government can give you a mask without bringing up a problem. It's a joke.
100,19,"I have a little question about the “Face the AIDS” song. It's a really good one, I don't even know what it is about the government. This song evokes so much emotion in me. It's pretty depressing to hear in a public setting."
100,24,"It sounds like they are bringing up a huge problem with masks that are not supposed to be treated with respect or care. It's a good idea to just don't say it, because the joke doesn't mean that you aren't a doctor and have to use a mask."
100,28,"'If you get sick, you have a mask. The only way to get out of your mask is to smoke. '"
100,32,"''I can tell you one thing about this song. The ""We can never forget that stuff"" is a quote from a doc.''"
100,35,It's a joke. They need to talk about HIV and stop people from spreading it.
100,42,"You are right, this is a joke and I'm not sure it's just a joke."
100,52,"AIDS is a disease. It's not a disease, it's a disease."
100,53,"The one and only has more information than ""the one and only"". I think it is good if people actually are using the song as a joke, not just to promote it."
100,54,"I love that song, I love the song and love to say that it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit bit scary."
100,83,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
100,88,">If you're still in the hospital, they'll probably send you back to work and you'll be fine. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is."
100,90,You want me to come off as a joke.
100,95,What's the problem with a mask? The government is bringing up AIDS to fight it...They are trying to do it to help stop the spread.
100,6,So you have no idea what the one and only song is about? Is it about the one and only song?
100,19,This is a very well known fact.
100,24,The joke is the truth. The government isn't using it to stop AIDS or stop it. The joke just works. You don't know what the answer is?
100,28,AIDS is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is a disease.
100,32,I don't know about the other comments but I like one of them.
100,35,"It's a joke, not a joke."
100,42,"... ""If you get sick, you have a mask. The only way to get out of your mask is to smoke."""
100,52,"No, it's not. It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
100,53,"I don't know what to think about the song, but if you want to know something like that, you have to start out with a song called ""The one and only"" by Bob Dylan."
100,54,"I've heard the word in the title, which has the meaning of ""I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but this is a really good quote from a doctor""."
100,83,I'm sorry that we can't stop...
100,88,That's an incompetent way of saying it.
100,90,If you have a problem with it then there is no problem with the masks. They're just a joke and it isn't a joke.
100,95,You've just been called a liar. You have to go and take an exam and ask for a doctor. A doctor is supposed to prescribe the right drugs and the right people. This is just because you don't know what they're talking about. It is a joke.
100,6,"A mask can be useful in the long run, too. It can also be dangerous for people in general."
100,19,"Its funny that the jokes if used correctly. You know, whats funny is when people eat the mask that they use as a joke to make you feel depressed."
100,24,"""I want you to come off as a joke. What's the problem with a mask? The government is bringing up AIDS to fight it."""
100,28,It doesn't work. But in the UK if you 'want to get a mask' you get to be in the hospital.
100,32,Nope. I just think that being in the middle of something like this is just stupid.
100,35,I like Bob Dylan and the lyrics are very similar.
100,42,"I can understand why people might say that, but it's not the actual point of the joke."
100,52,"If you have a disease, you have a mask. If you do, you have a sneeze. If you don't have a disease, you have a sneeze. If you don't have a disease, you have a sneeze. If you have a disease, you have a sneeze. If you have a disease, you have a sneeze. If you have a disease, you have a sneezes."
100,53,It's not a joke. This is a joke. It's a joke.
100,54,"I don't know what a doctor is talking about, but this is one of the many, many different things the government does that's not a joke."
100,83,They're supposed to fix AIDS as fast as they can. The government is bringing it up in a public health center. A doctor is supposed to help diagnose AIDS and take a blood test to diagnose AIDS. There are so many different ways to diagnose AIDS and a lot of people don't know about it. This is why they have a sham to fix it.
100,88,"> I love that song, I love the song and love to say that it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit bit bit scary. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
100,90,It's kind of a joke. But you're actually not a person with AIDS. The truth is you're not just a joke. It's not an actual disease or a virus. It's just a mental illness.
100,95,"I'm a doctor and I've seen some crazy doctors do this, and a lot of them have not had that happen. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
100,6,"A mask is a joke, not a good idea. A good idea is to let people use a mask to stop or at least prevent something from spreading. There's no joke about that. A mask is an evil."
100,19,"A doctor can do what a mask does, as long as it is a joke. I think it's a joke, a bit of a joke."
100,24,"I would never have said that.. I would say ""You're a pretty good guy who is a doctor and a bit more interested in health than people that aren't doctors.""."
100,28,"It's not a joke, it's a shit joke."
100,32,"AIDS is a very common disease involving the immune system, which is a kind of AIDS that is symptomatic. There is a song about AIDS called ""The One and Only"" that is about how the government helps with spreading a disease. It's essentially a joke about how the government helps with spreading a disease, but is also an actual slur that people get on the radio. ""They say something like, 'Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it's not a slur, because"
100,35,The song is about HIV and what's actually dangerous to people with it. The lyrics of it are very similar.
100,42,"I can understand why people might say that, but it's not the actual point of the joke."
100,52,This is a good one for everyone :)
100,53,>I'm sorry that we can't stop... That's an incompetent way of saying it.
100,54,"“I don’t know what a doctor is talking about, but this is one of the many, many different things the government does that’s not a joke."
100,83,"AIDS is actually very dangerous in America, and I haven't had a problem with any of these things, but in my experience it makes a lot of people sick and make them more likely to get sick. It can be very common and it's easy to treat it."
100,88," I'm sorry that we can't stop, but I'm not allowed to laugh about it. This is just stupid. I'm a doctor and I've seen some crazy doctors do this, and a lot of them have not had that happen. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
100,90,There's a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat AIDS.
100,95,if someone has an infection they are in fact getting more than just a few.
100,6,It's a joke. It's a joke.
100,19,"As a doctor, the song sounds pretty funny. I'd say ""That's funny."""
100,24,Affirmative action is part of the way the government is using a mask. AIDS is a disease that's more of a mental illness. There is a song about it called Face the AIDS which has a slur.
100,28,"What's funny is that the song says, ""The one and only"" based on this ""one and only"" joke that makes a lot of people think it's funny and just makes it fun, but if it's anything like ""I don't know what a doctor is talking about,"" it's more like ""If you aren't able to be frank about HIV or if you're able to put on a mask to fight AIDS or if you are just trying to be in a hospital with it."""
100,32,"I think a lot of people would be more apt to dismiss the shit joke as a joke in the symphony version of what it is. ""If you're going to ask me if I can come off as a bit dickish and insulting. The truth is you're not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke."
100,35,"""It's not a joke. A mask is a joke. A good idea is to let people use a mask to stop or at least prevent something from spreading. It's not a joke. A good idea is to let people use a mask to stop or at least prevent something from spreading. It's not a joke. A mask is an evil. A doctor can do what a mask does, as long as it is a joke."
100,42,There's a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS which is basically a joke about the government helping spread AIDS. There's no joke about that.
100,52,I'm sorry the government can't stop... But I think this is a joke.
100,53,I've got a question: who are the people that are using the song?
100,54,The people who do this are the ones who have no problem with the government and who don't have the motivation to help.
100,83,I'm a doctor and I have the book and it's pretty good. I was able to listen to it because it was so gruesome. And I was scared I'm not even a doctor.
100,88,"This quote is about the fact that the government is helping people spread AIDS, not the joke, which is the main point of the quote. A mask prevents a virus, but it's also an actual slur. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
100,90,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
100,95,"One of the most interesting things about this song is that there are other comments saying it's just the government. Basically, if a person had an infection they'd be getting more than a few if that was the case."
100,6,"It's a joke, and it's not even funny."
100,19,AIDS is a serious illness. And it affects millions of Americans. It's so depressing that you can't understand why people have a problem with it.
100,24,I think the people who are trying to laugh about this aren't the people who are complaining.
100,28,A mask prevents AIDS. It's not a joke. It's a joke. A mask is an evil. A mask is a joke. A mask is an evil. A mask is an evil. A mask is a joke.
100,32,"It's also a joke that the government is using in their fight against HIV. Essentially it's a joke about how you can't ""prevent"" AIDS, but rather it can't ""prevent"" a virus from spreading. It can be very common and it's easy to treat it."
100,35,It's a joke.
100,42,"People get sick, get AIDS, get cancer and they're not getting any."
100,52,"[The one and only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_and_famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_and_famine) is a website devoted to people who are infected with AIDS, with some facts about it."
100,53,"So, the guy who said it, and the other guy who says it, in his last words and phrases, makes a good point?"
100,54,It was a joke. The lyrics sounded like a joke and I don't like it. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people.
100,83,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
100,88,"I had a conversation with a friend when I was a doctor with AIDS and she said that this was not a joke, but a joke about a health emergency. I think this is how people get sick because they are uncomfortable and not even able to see what it is."
100,90,"What was the lyrics? They weren't on Face the AIDS, it was about a virus."
100,95,"I'm a doctor and I've seen this song called ""The One and Only"" by Tom Cruise is very popular."
100,6,"It is a joke, and it isn't even funny."
100,19,"I grew up in the 'wars of the world' and have seen many of those memes. I can tell you that the joke is so sad, and that this is not going to change."
100,24,"""Somebody else is bringing it up. That's the joke that makes me feel guilty. But I do think it's funny to think that someone who is trying to make a point isn't going to be able to really understand the concept of the word ""jam""."
100,28,I've listened to Face the AIDS a few times now and it's a good song.
100,32,"The movie is not about HIV. It's about the government trying to combat AIDS, but it's also about how people get sick."
100,35,if they're using the same song as face the AIDS it's a joke.
100,42,"""The One and Only"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's on the soundtrack of the AIDS Sickness TV show. It's like a great episode of Doctor Who."
100,52,AIDS is a disease. AIDS is an epidemic. It affects millions of Americans. It's so depressing that you can't understand why people have a problem with it. I think the people who are trying to laugh about this aren't the people who are complaining.
100,53,"There is a song called ""The One and Only"" that is about how the government helps with spreading a virus."
100,54,Y’all are really just being sarcastic. This is a really very sad song. I guess you could say that because the only thing AIDS would make is a mask and that the government isn’t trying to help it. I don’t know what it’s all about.
100,83,"The song is funny, the lyrics are not funny, the message is genuinely interesting, but I don't think any of the other things in it are funny."
100,88,The song is about the fact that the government is using the mask to combat the AIDS. The lyrics are in the book and on the radio.
100,90,"What about the word ""cookie cutter""? I'm trying to guess that it was actually a joke. Aside from the joke, this isn't a joke."
100,95,"I don't understand why people get sick, get AIDS, get cancer, get AIDS."
100,6,“We are all going to be able to say that if I’m going to make an error I can help you”
100,19,"""I am a doctor. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. So, the guy who said it, and the other guy who said it, in his last words and phrases, makes a good point? It was a joke. The lyrics sounded like a joke and I don't like it.

100,83,I've heard about this song a few times. I've just been listening to it a lot.

100,19,So you're saying that you are not a doctor or a medic? Because that's a good answer.
100,24,What are the lyrics of this song?
100,28,"'It doesn't work. But in the UK if you 'want to get a mask' you get to be in the hospital."""
100,32,AIDS is a slur. I’m a doctor and I don’t really get how the word “I” works. It’s a joke because people don’t like it. It’s just a slur.
100,35,It's a joke a lot of people seem to take solace in.
100,42,Is 'the one and only thing we can control' what the joke says about the government?
100,52,"Apparently, they're trying to stop the spread of AIDS by using a mask that's a joke."
100,53,"And the song is called ""Task The Doctor.''"
100,54,Is the song about the government? Probably not.
100,83,I really liked that song and I can’t stand the idea of this song being a joke. I’m just saying.
100,88,I would not make this a joke. I would make it a joke to those who don't want to get sick.
100,90,"I don't think I know what 'Annie the Pooh' is, just that it sounds like an ""Annie the Pooh"" slang. But when I thought about that.. I heard a song about AIDS. (Was one of the things my wife said??) It's just a song about it. And the lyrics? ""Annie the Pooh""? I thought that was about what the Pooh is about. I said ""I'm trying to make a joke"" but I couldn't figure out what it is about"
100,95,"They were trying to combat AIDS. AIDS is not a disease, it is a disease."

100,83,I think the problem with this is that the lyrics are not well written. It's more about the fact that AIDS is the problem that makes people sick. And that it's not a joke. It's just a joke.
100,88,>It's a joke because people don't like it. It’s just a joke. It’s just stupid.

100,95,There are a lot of things I've noticed that make you think:
100,6,"I'd say if it doesn't work, I'll get some AIDS vaccines. I'd say that it's a bad idea. A lot of people have said they'll stop using the stuff and get AIDS. But I think that's a pretty good way to phrase it. I like the song. I can't think of a better one."

100,28,I have this whole AIDS joke thing going on and I can't believe how bad it is for the whole people who are in hospital with HIV.

100,95,It's a joke. They are trying to help combat AIDS and I'd be a little bit worried if they would use a mask on me if I wasn't a doctor.
100,6,"It's a joke, and it's not a joke, because it's not a joke."
100,19,The fact that this is a 'daily joke' reminds me of the other sexist jokes I had with a child. You should be ashamed of this.
100,24,The one of the many good things about the song is that it is a good one that's good because it's a slang phrase that people don't like.

100,24,I think the problem here is that the government can use a mask to help combat AIDS. The problem is not that the government is helping the spread of the virus.

100,88,"I grew up on a farm in Maryland, and I still don't have a lot of people around me to know the meaning of the word ""Joke"" for the whole thing."
100,90,There is a r/aspn. I'm going to have to say this one.
100,95,So there’s nothing to be done. Unless you are doing that to make them more sexist.

100,19,"That's the real point of this article, not to make any sense."
100,24,"What the government is trying to do is try to make the government feel better, if it were a virus."

100,35,r/AIDS is trying to weed out the people in the US that hate it.
100,42,I think a lot of the above are just a few of the more common stuff I heard:
100,52,I was gonna say that if you don’t wear a mask you have to go to a doctor. Because that’s how the disease is spread and a mask prevents it is actually good advice. The best is that it keeps the sneezes down and the sneezes don’t get on your throat. That is how it works. I’d recommend it to everyone.
100,53,The song is about the government helping spread a virus.
100,54,AIDS is not a virus. It is a disease. It's not a virus. It's not a disease and the government can't stop it.
100,83,"I think you may not be a good friend, but maybe a better one?"
100,88,"It's the only reason they call a joke a joke, it's why we call it a joke."
100,90,"There is a r/aspn that will spoof you as ""aspn is about the government helping people who have HIV to combat AIDS."""
100,95,I’d take this post.
100,6,"The one and only song I just read said that the government used ""Madnesses"" for the prevention of AIDS epidemic, which is a joke, but it sounds so funny."
100,19,"I mean that's not so good, right? It's a joke. You can be a good doctor, but not an alcoholic? That's not an excuse for a joke. A joke is one of those things."
100,24,...I'm going to go...

100,35,r/AIDS is a joke. It isn’t a joke.
100,42,A mask will help you fight off a virus. It can do that.
100,52,"You're being a bit harsh, isn't it?'I thought they were trying to sell me a mask because I'm not a doctor'."
100,53,"So it is actually good advice if people actually are using the song as a joke, not just to promote it."
100,54,I threw my hair out so hard. I couldn't stand the feeling. It just didn't make me chuckle. I was sick with AIDS.
100,83,"I think the thing about r/aspn is that it is not intended as a joke, but rather an opinion. It's a place where you can find people who don't have it in a sense that you should listen to it."
100,88,It's a joke because there is no logical reason to believe that a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus.
100,90,I have a bunch of comments about the song and I just can't get enough of them. I think they make a lot of sense.
100,95,"People who are a doctor are people who are a little bit of a dick. It's like trying to put a mask on all the time. The first thing you do is start putting a mask on yourself. If you want to get rid of it, then it should be safe for you to do so - just get the shit out of your face and let them get to you. I recommend you stop and think about what happened. Then get sick and quit smoking."
100,6,I hate when people use a joke. I'm the guy in the video that started getting the AIDS.
100,19,I don't think I'm a doctor in the slightest. I just feel like this 'dick' is overplaying the entire point of the song.

100,42,"It's a joke, a joke."
100,52,This is a good one for everybody. I don't think anyone is going to make it the worst joke ever.

100,88,The lyrics of the song are on the radio. They're a joke.
100,90,"People with HIV/Aids are going to find it very difficult to fight the virus. In fact, it’s a really scary condition. You don’t need a mask to be able to help you fight it. So you just need a mask."
100,95,This is why people use r/aspn. This is not the time to be a doctor because it's not funny.
100,6,"Yes, the problem is that this joke is not funny. It’s the way people perceive it to be."
100,19,It's not about that. The song is about how the AIDS virus is a major disease that affects millions of Americans.
100,24,"I read the headline. It's funny. It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. And it's not a joke."
100,28,That's a very misleading name.

Possibly, but not necessarily to make a point.

100,24,I think it's a tad misinformed - people are gonna do whatever they want and that's what happens when they don't understand this. This is a joke about the government causing problems to millions of people.
100,28,"It sounds a little like a joke, but the joke itself is funny."
100,32,The only thing that could come of it is that people aren't going to get sick from something that doesn't have a real cure.

100,52,"I have a long history of having trouble getting into the right sneeze, and have learned that the joke is about a disease that does not have any clinical meaning and is very inflammatory to the brain. My wife had a similar story about her 'depression' when she got into a cold."

100,90,"AIDS is an actual disease and people are apathetic. I'm afraid there's not enough information about the disease for me to do this, and it's hard to tell what it is, and even if it is a joke, it is an actual disease. It is not an actual disease, and it's just a mental illness. There are many diseases that need to be controlled and treated in the way they are able to prevent them."

I can't imagine a lot of people who would never be able to be able to take that type of attitude."
100,28,"It's probably a joke because the words are used as a means of describing the symptoms. The joke is about how the government is trying to help with spreading HIV (i.e. the government helps people with AIDS) by using the word ""joke"". This guy is being a joke because he is trying to justify his point to the media and he is trying to make this a joke."

100,42,"A few of those jokes are from people who haven't heard the lyrics and are still at work and still feel sick. The CDC is trying to cut some of the stigma out of being able to work at a medical practice. A few more are getting worse. It's actually a bit harder to get sick because they use a much more succinct and indoctrinating technique that was used to help people in a medical context, and it just takes them a long time to get rid of a medical facility."

100,90,It's not a joke because people don't want to know what a joke is. It's a joke because people don't like it.

I also think it's a great thing for them to not want to make a joke, and to tell people to go do it."
100,83,"I think the joke was more about being able to find people who were sick and that it was an easy way to get them to talk and not worrying about what others think about it.

100,88,AIDS isn't a joke. It's a threat to the public health and your health. You have to be concerned that your disease will spread despite being on the brink of getting sick. So you don't want to be in a position to be able to do so.
100,90,A lot of people with HIV get AIDS because of their mask.
100,95,The guy describing this is the one.
100,6,"As the guy saying ""I don't know why people have a problem with it. I don't know why people have a problem with it"" makes it sound like the joke is about the government. He seems very concerned about the implication that the joke is about ""helping people prevent the spread of a disease"" and the joke is about that. Specifically, the ""Madness"" song, which is about how you can get away with what you're talking about."
