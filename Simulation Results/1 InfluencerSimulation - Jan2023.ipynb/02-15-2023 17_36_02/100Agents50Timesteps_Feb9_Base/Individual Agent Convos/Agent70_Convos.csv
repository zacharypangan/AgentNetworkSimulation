85,70,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.

70,5,The ad is saying people who don't wear masks are in fact more susceptible to a virus than a normal person with a mask. It's very sad to me that a lot of people are now vaccinated and are seeing the truth.

70,14,"People who aren't in the health care field often wear masks for emergencies - most of the time those things just end up in their heads. There is nothing like the safety of a real person using a mask to walk through a restaraunt, and the security of someone who is there to get them off. It is not an uncommon habit for someone who's not in a health care field to wear a mask, especially to help a patient."

70,18,This is what a lot of people forget about putting on a mask in public - the fact that it's the only way to stay safe and a clingy mask is enough to keep people from talking to each other.
70,24,"You did dumb things, huh?"
70,28,You are not a fool. You are a criminal.
70,29,This is the most obvious scam.
70,33,"The truth is, even if you are vaccinated and you don't have a mask on, you have no protection against the virus."

70,39,"i'm not saying it's ok to not wear a mask, but that's why i hate coaches. i'm saying that they can't be trusted in the meds industry with these kinds of regulations unless they're able to find a better way to prevent a virulent disease, and that putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt is a stupid thing."

77,70,This is one of the most innocuous parts of this topic. It's almost as if they're trying to scare someone into wearing a mask for the purpose of scaring them into thinking that they have a virus.
83,70,It's a strange thought but it's one of the things i learned over the years about sd. sd has many anti bacterial laws and has one of them:...
85,70,I've tried to use a mask before and it seems to work a lot better than the regular mask

70,8,"As a non-athlete, I can say with certainty that the way this video is playing is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life.

70,14,"If you want to be a good coach, you need to get a helmet and a mask. Having a mask is a job that requires you to be aware that there is an infection in your body, and that your job will be sloppy if that doesn't work."
70,15,This is about the most obvious scam.
70,17,So what do you mean by the way they are trying to stop people from wearing a mask when they are at work?

70,33,Vaccination is the right thing to do in a doctor’s office. It’s also not a good idea to take off a mask at work. You’re probably not going to get a better job.
70,35,"I've been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don't really think it's a big deal."
70,39,I was one of the first ones to come across this at the time.
70,42,"It’s in the hands of the physician, he’s not obligated to wear a mask. He’s an official spokesman."
70,48,"I don't understand how a mask can work. It can work a lot better than a regular mask. The mask is not enough to cover the face with, and can't give it enough protection against something like the phlegm virus."
70,54,It's not about you. It's about your mask.

83,70,"What is a mask? A mask? Vaccination is a fucked up thing, huh?"
85,70,I just got a new mask. I think it works better. It's been for 4 years and it is the best.
87,70,What are you referring to? This is not a good idea to make an appointment to go through all the paperwork and documenting the events.
91,70,"I want to tell you this: I am in the minority, and I don't think I could ever be a good person without a mask. I am not in the minority. I don't like to be a woman, and I don't like being seen in public with people I care about. I know it sounds crazy, but I don't think it really matters to me. I can only see the beauty in my work, so I do it. It's part of my life."
70,5,I can't stand this.
70,8,I just wanted to make sure you guys were aware that the government has no obligation to protect people who aren't vaccinated and can't walk through restaraunts in public.

70,28,"Vaccination in your country is the 'best way'. It works better, I think, but not enough to stop the spread of a virus."

74,70,They say it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm just going to assume that this sub has the same problem.
77,70,"As someone who has never actually figured out what's going on in the world with her mask, I'm really not sure why you're doing it."
83,70,"That is really interesting. Having a mask, being a snooping public figure is the best way to stop a virus spreading in a public place."

70,39,"I am sick of the words ""I think you're missing out."" but the people here are in a really horrible place."
70,42,"It's like getting a new job! Until a few months from now, you will find that your friends are getting sick, so you'll start going to the doctor for help with your sick. Having a mask at work is a good thing because it's an incredibly effective way to get away from a virus."

74,70,[Lots of people on this sub agree to disagree with you.
77,70,Basically: wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,70,The point is that the CDC should be able to say there's no mandatory vaccines in places where people do not wear them.
85,70,"If this is a scam, don't."
87,70,"I thought it was actually a joke, but I also thought that it's really about the mask. So why not get a full blown HIV shot? I really want to see if there are any signs of HIV on the news or in the streets."
91,70,"I think it's because you're a male, and you have a big restaraunt that you wear every day. It doesn't make sense to you. It doesn't have a purpose, it doesn't have a purpose, and it makes it impossible to see a man with a big restaraunt."
70,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,8,"He was trying to make sure the public knew about the ""no duty to protect people who aren't vaccinated"" part. Then he was trying to make sure everyone knew this part, which was all of a sudden outright false."
70,14,"Vaccination isn't a bad idea. If he is a doctor or spokesman, he doesn't have to wear a mask at work."
70,15,My wife was in a similar situation as the guy he was talking to had to wear a mask for a job interview.
70,17,">I think I see this as a sign that there is no cure for HIV. That's actually not the CDC. Vaccination isn't a bad idea, but it isn't necessary."
70,18,So you're saying you're a criminal for having a mask? Why are you that stupid if you have one?
70,24,I am sick of the fact that I can't get a doctor's appointment because of wearing a mask.
70,28,"I'm just saying that I know some people who're going to be snooping in public and get shot up in the fucking air for not wearing a mask, but it's not a good idea. It's basically a fucking joke. I get to see a lot of people with the flu. It's just a lot of people who're just freaking out."
70,29,I don't think it's a scam. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.
70,33,"As you can see from the title, it's the first time that I ever read this post, and it's just really strange. It's like saying you're not the first person to see a man with a mask everyday - not a guy in a mask."
70,35,">I would like to wear a mask, but I'm a male. I don't want a mask. I want to wear a mask."
70,39,"I think he may have been in the wrong. And it sounds like it's an obvious joke, just not the correct one. I think it's probably because he's not the smartest guy in the world."
70,42,"What I mean by that is that when I was younger, I had an old dc shirt that said ""I want to have a mask at work"", a CDC staffer that had a new job at the CDC that was not working anymore, because he didn't have a mask on. When I was younger, I'd work at a government agency, but it was always with a CDC staffer."
70,48,"I think the guy was describing what a good thing it is, but that is a fact that is so much more dangerous to a person than a regular mask. And that he isn't wearing a mask, he is a woman. But there is also no need to wear a mask at work if he has HIV."

70,67,The government has a monopoly on what people wear at work.
70,68,... that's an awful idea that doesn't even mean that you don't want a better job.
74,70,"They say it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If a team is putting up with the government's inability to prevent a virus, then there is no way to stop it from happening. And while it does stop it, the team will still not be able to stop it from happening."
77,70,"The government has no incentive to rape people or to scare people into believing the government is raped. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."
83,70,They could give you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag.
85,70,"I got a new mask last night and just wanted to let you know that I've a bit of a problem with it. I have a large problem with it. I want to know about your friend who still needs one, but it sounds like yours."
87,70,"I want to get a mask for a day or two because my job is not getting any money. I will get the full blown HIV shot, as well as a face mask for a month if I go to the doctor."
91,70,So you've done the stuff I did with a mask. I just said that.
70,5,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,8,I’m going to get my life back on track. I’m also going to keep putting on a mask for a week or two in case of a big problem. I want to snoop for days and months. I also need to wear a vaccinated mask for work.
70,14,And they give them some money for it.
70,15,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it isn't necessary."
70,17,"A very old poster said in this context that ""I think I see this as a sign that there is no cure for HIV. That's actually not the CDC. Vaccination isn't a bad idea, but it isn't necessary."""

70,28,"Vaccination in the United States, if used correctly, is considered a medical malpractice. That said, it's not a medical malpractice - it is a part of a medical malpractice insurance company. It's not a medical malpractice insurance company that sells or provides a vaccine to prevent any cases of a virus."
70,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,33,A CDC worker gets shot in the face while wearing a mask in the office - that's not a good idea

70,48,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it isn't necessary. The government has no incentive to rape people. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth. They could give you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag. I just said that."

87,70,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's how we are gonna get people sick. I've seen an article on that website that says that the government has a legitimate problem with this.

I don't like to be around people. I don't like being around people, but I don't like being around them. I can only see the beauty in my work, so I do it. It's part of my life, and I'm not going to be around people"
70,5,"I'm the best person I know. I'm a woman with a mask who can eat, and I do it."
70,8,"Are you referring to the fact that the government has no responsibility to protect people from a virus? Vaccination in the US, if used correctly, is considered a medical malpractice. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."
70,14,"It's not an illegal act - it's an act of a crime, in which it's illegal to be fired."

70,59,"I don't know what's on this topic, but the problem is the NSA isn't there yet. It's being run by a crappy, ignorant, and corrupted entity. The CDC isn't involved in raping people, but preventing it would make it seem like there isn't enough to stop them."
70,61,I'm so glad I don't think people understand what they're talking about.
70,67,Vaccination isn't necessary. A CDC worker gets shot in the face while wearing a mask in the office.
70,68,"In this case, I think the government is doing it for the right reasons, and that they are a good way of making them appear as smarter, more self-sufficient, and more confident in their ability to be more effective. They aren't a government agency. The NSA is, in fact, a government agency."
74,70,"The only reason I'm not gonna go get a hat is because it's a mask, a hat in the right way, and it's a mask for the players to wear on their team. The mask is not what they get for the team - it's what they get for the players."
77,70,"I’d say there’s some rambling here. What is the purpose of the NSA mandate? The NSA’s mandate is not to prevent rape, but to prevent it from spreading and preventing a variety of diseases. There are a few things the NSA is doing about it, such as preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It isn’t about the NSA requiring it to stop because it ain’t a mandate. They are also a criminal organisation, which is why it's the one that the NSA wants to stop."

That's why you need a mask and a helmet, not a mask. This is not what they're recommending, they're requiring people to do it."

70,28,"So what is the meaning of the word ""vaccination""? You can't do that without having a sarcasm attack."
70,29,"The NSA has a mandate that allows the CDC to be a credible agent in the fight against rape, because the mandate doesn't really make sense to them."

They're going to become the next victim of the CDC's government-supported scams."
70,42,"Honestly, I feel pretty much the same way."
70,48,"I think you misunderstood the meaning of the phrase. It’s like the government attempting to be an asshole, and not the NSA, whose purpose it’s to stop people from getting sick?"

There’s nothing wrong with putting on a mask for a reason."", ""Essentially: wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS."

70,17,"Honestly, I think you misunderstood the meaning of the phrase. It’s almost as if they’re trying to be an asshole, and not the NSA."
70,18,Getting vaccinated from HIV/AIDS is a very easy and non-smoking thing. The mask is an obvious way of hiding the infection from you. People are trying to justify themselves and their friends using the CDC to help them. I know that sounds a bit depressing.
70,24,"It's a joke. There's no difference between a mask, and a mask."
70,28,"The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. It works better, I think, but not enough to stop the spread of a virus."

70,54,People wear masks to protect themselves. They don't get sick from it.

74,70,"I've heard that the president wears masks to prevent the spread of AIDS. I'm not sure what to say, but it's definitely an interesting fact."
77,70,I think the problem is that this is illegal and it's not even legal.

85,70,"Yes, there is. Exactly what I meant. Basically, you lose your face because you wear a mask for work. You get sick and die because it is not a mask. It's all about getting the government's attention. That's a joke."
87,70,The government is trying to help.
91,70,"If they were to put a phd in there, they would make it illegal for it to be put on, but that's just plain stupid nonsense."
70,5,"I have a phd in AIDS, i'm getting vaccinated"
70,8,I don't know if you could tell the difference between wearing a mask and the CDC's mandate:
70,14,"I think the CDC has a good point, but it seems like they don't want to bring this up enough to get people sick that they will be on the side of it, not that they're not."
70,15,Vaccination is good. The problem with wearing a mask is not how you can take care of yourself.
70,17,"I don’t understand this. Its not illegal, but it is a pretty interesting fact about the government. There are some people with HIV/AIDS that are not doing it. I’m not sure what your point is."

70,28,"In the US, it is considered a medical malpractice by the CDC to get a vaccine in place in order to prevent the spread of the virus. This is how the government acts to prevent the spread of the virus."
70,29,The way the president does things and you want to stop the spread of a virus is just stupid.
70,33,"It sounds like this whole thing is pretty crazy, I think it's a nice gesture to encourage your friends and colleagues to get in better medical facilities instead of being the ones who are on the hook for anything, especially if they're not good at their job.

70,29,"I've heard this in the news all day, but I'm more than a little worried about the virus."
70,33,"As long as you do not have HIV, or you have a vaccinated friend, that's a good deal."
70,35,It doesn't matter if he is a doctor. He knows how to do it for himself.
70,39,"A new tarot card titled ""The President wears a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It is the only way to prevent it. It is the only way to prevent it. There is no other way to stop it. It's not a good idea. If they don't have enough money, they won't be able to afford to have the AIDS vaccine."
70,42,It sounds like he's trying to get his fucking friend off and take some pictures of people on their phone.
70,48,"He's using the word ""asshole"" to refer to the CIA, not the CDC and the CDC. That means the CIA doesn't actually have a position against AIDS. They don't seem to want to do anything to make their own point, and the CDC isn't willing to stop any rape if they can't keep in touch with the public. It's an anti-smoking act, but it's a fact and isn't a joke in this context, but if you're an"
70,54,Vaccination isn’t a medical malpractice. It’s a medical malpractice. The government isn’t doing it at all and not even aware that it is being implemented in a medical manner.
70,59,So the President wears a mask to stop the spread of AIDS?
70,61,"I can say this because the president of the United States is the newest president of a nation, which has a lot to offer. And I believe that the American people are making their fortunes by covering up their HIV epidemics. And I believe that the President is trying to turn people on to his side."

74,70,"I don't know a single gif from a recent interview. It was from a hockey coach who wore a mask, and had no idea that it was a prank. The gif he posted made it sound like that was the most pranking comment of the night and it wasn't even even a joke."

70,14,"I don't see how it's wrong for him to force people into wearing a mask because of his lack of knowledge of tarot cards. He's talking about a person who knows tarot cards, and why it's a prank - like a clown, or the president. Obviously the president knows what they're doing, but they're pointing out a very big problem with Obama's tarot cards."

I have not used a mask in a long time, but I’ve seen a lot of people go in with the mask when snooping. I’m not sure how I could ever use a mask when I had a snooping mask when I was in the CDC.

70,5,"If you are trying to make the president a prank, it is a prank."

70,33,"This prank is not going to go away for a long time, I have a book, and it's pretty amazing how much you can actually snoop on a CDC worker when they get shot in the face. You could just be a tarot card or a prank but still."
70,35,The people who've been pranking are the ones who've gotten sick and haven't been vaccinated. This isn't just about the pranks. It's about getting to know people with AIDS. This is a prank about a person who hasn't been vaccinated.

70,61,"I don't believe you, but I think OP is a prankster."
70,67,The problem with tarot is that many people think they are a tarot card. So it makes sense.

He uses it to help him sleep and helps him to take better care of himself and his family, and because he is sick and is afraid. He wears a mask to keep his face warm but is terrified. I have no idea how he can get sick without it. If his wife keeps on wearing it in front of him, then he can't sleep at night because he wants to"
87,70,I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the following is my favourite quote from that book:
91,70,"The man wearing the mask, for example, had a small hole in his face, which had a very large hole in his chest. In his case, he was a doctor. I know it sounds silly, but I think he just didn't want to see a man with a mask, which is what he did to a few other men. I don't think he knew what he was doing."

There is nothing like the safety of a real person using a mask to walk through a restaraunt, and the security of someone who snoops, and"
70,15,"I can't be the one to be mad at people who don't know what to do. The problem is that they are going to take it personally, even if they have nothing to do with it. But the fact that people who are narcissistic and ninjaish like to pretend it's the best way to stop people from being sick is just the kind of shaming they will take."
70,17,What was the joke? I'm sure the people on the bus who don't wear masks have some sort of phobia or fear or something.
70,18,It's a shame that he didn't have a tarot card when he did it.

70,28,"I just read this. So.. yes, the CDC can't mandate people to wear a mask in public when they're in need of it or the vaccine in their hospital, but they can, if they're in the right country, take the mask."
70,29,And now I'm going to say this.
70,33,I think this is a fun prank but really I can see why people think it is funny. People get to go to the office a lot without a mask and are never really given a chance for them to be able to make eye contact.
70,35,I'm sure you're thinking of the tarot cards.
70,39,"I like to think of it as a joke because I've never heard anyone say that they think they're the pranksters. Like that guy who stole a tarot card and went apeshit on some guy and got shot in the face. Its a joke, a joke."
70,42,This is why it's an issue.
70,48,The people who've been pranking are the ones who've gotten sick and haven't been vaccinated.

70,24,"A prank, not a joke, is a prank. People prank on the CDC, a lot of the time it makes them look bad."
70,28,What's the story behind this? It is so incredibly stupid that you have to explain it to people without knowing about the subject.
70,29,This is a prank. A prank that demonstrates how shady it is and why it's a prank is like the tarot card thing?

91,70,"The person who supposedly went to school with HIV was very sick and didn't really need the mask. And the guy who did the training was really stupid - in the case of him he only had to go to school and got HIV, which was why he was asked to wear a mask at all. And it was in a real world - a lot of people are getting it."

70,18,I would have never jumped into the CDC's role.
70,24,"You can't tell whether you're getting a sick person a prank, or what the tarot means - if you don't tell them, they're doing it. The CDC says there is no difference between a mask, and a mask. If the tarot says a prank, they can say they can't be a prank, so why not make that a joke?"

I'm just saying that if there is a good way to do things, or that it's just funny, then it should be nice, and funny as hell."
70,35,I think there's some kind of logic that allows it to be considered a prank or a joke to show people what the underlying meaning of the joke is.

70,28,"It was made to make people laugh, not prank. It was not that it was a joke."
70,29,Vaccination isn't needed in a lot of cases. AIDS is a lot more common than people might think. And the whole idea of putting on a mask while in a prank with someone who is a prankster is just a joke.

70,67,"This has to be the most interesting thing to me. It's funny that someone is putting on a mask because they have HIV. They were playing a joke about how the CDC had just vaccinated their family and they tamed their kids, and they had a snoop on a joke about it.

70,42,"The quote from the documentary, ""the fucking thing"" is what I've just been reading."
70,48,Vaccination is a joke. But it's not necessary. They just want to try and save lives.
70,54,Vaccination is an action taken to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't involved in preventing HIV.
70,59,I think putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

77,70,Isn’t the deck really a joke? I’m in awe of the fact that the tarot is a real card. Whether or not it’s actually a joke is a big deal and they are not trying to make a joke out of it. The tarot is the best way to tell a joke.
83,70,I feel like the entire AMA is a bit funny. Isn't that more of a satire?
85,70,">I would say this as an example of the CDC trying to get people to believe it is a joke. It’s funny, but it’s not a joke."

70,29,... and a lot of people do the tarot card.
70,33,That one doesn't make any sense at all to me. A lot of people are pranksters.
70,35,"This is a bit too obvious for us, but I have the impression this isn't really a joke. It's just one of the more common pranks."
70,39,I think the whole point of wearing a mask is to reassure people that you have some sort of AIDS vaccine and you're on the right track for taking it. The fact that this is an obvious prank by the government and that he needs to be on the list is the right way to take it away. It's not a joke.
70,42,"As a doctor in the gov't I've come to realize that the doctor can't say that the doctor has to wear a mask when they get sick, which in turn means they've been nabbed or something. The doctor, the doctor, etc."

70,59,A tarot card is a good thing to ask yourself.
70,61,This is a prank.
70,67,I'm not sure it's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke.

That was when the CDC had a special case for the AIDS virus. I said ""I have a phobia of flying flies."" and then I went to the clinic and they told me that it was a joke and a good idea to tell people to come out and help them. Vaccination is the best thing to do in this case he was a joke to make it sound like."
70,17,There isn't a prank.
70,18,This is what I'm saying.
70,24,"A lot of people do this, and we're all pretty good with them."
70,28,I'm very confused as to why it's called a prank.
70,29,Nope. It's a prank. A prank. It's a joke. A prank. A prank because it's a joke.

70,48,So here’s the thing:
70,54,This is not just a tarot card - there's a lot of people in the tarot cards are really terrible.

70,61,The CDC are not a prankster. They are a joke. They do not do anything about it.
70,67,A lot of people are pranksters. I have seen a lot of pranks about them in the tarot decks.
70,68,"If it's a joke, then no, a prank. No, a prank. No, no."
74,70,"So you can see this from your point of view, but the president is a joke and a joke isn't a joke? You can see that there's a joke that's not a joke. But I think the president is a joke. Because he wants to prevent AIDS and is trying to stop it, he is a joke."
77,70,"So when you put it like this and try to think... i'm gonna call this a joke, not a joke?"
83,70,You're assuming the CDC is trying to help'stop'the spread of a virus.
85,70,"""I have a problem with it because I am not a doctor"""

70,14,"oh, this just isn't real, you know..."
70,15,"In terms of the prank, I’d say it’s a prank if it were a joke."
70,17,"I think the whole point of this tarot card was just to tell people the truth. This isn't a joke and I don't think it's even a joke. The point of this is that it's not a prank, it's that it's a joke."
70,18,I’m a doctor so I know this is going to be a really hard time for me if I don’t wear a mask. I just want my job to be a little more convenient.
70,24,"he's going to go to the doctor's office and make a joke about the cdc. It's a prank because he's the cdc's agent. This is just a joke, because it's a joke that's part of the cdc's policy."
70,28,"People are pranksters, and the fact that there's nothing to do is actually funny. People are pranksters."
70,29,) I'm very confused as to why it's called a prank.
70,33,"I have a friend who is in my room and she is very nice and doesn't bother getting a mask, I just think she should just be the joke that people are making fun of her and she should do it."
70,35,''I don't think it's a joke because the tarot is the joke. They are not involved in preventing the spread of AIDS.
70,39,"So, here is the best I can do:"
70,42,"I was a physician at the CDC, and this was a joke. It’s like the most egregious thing in the world. It’s a joke because it’s a joke."
70,48,People use the CDC to get the public on the dpc. The CDC just tells people that this is a prank.
70,54,A lot of people wear the tarot cards to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
70,59,A lot of people are calling it a prank because they know it's a joke.
70,61,"A prank that is more a joke is a prank. If someone is doing a prank about you, and they are doing it, then it is going to be a joke, and the CDC isn't going to be a joke."
70,67,"A lot of people don't know if it's a joke or not, but I think it is a joke. Vaccination isn't necessary. It isn't necessary. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. It works better, I think, but not enough to stop the spread of a virus."
70,68,It seems like the CDC and the CDC are trying to convince the people on the list to actually get a better job. The fact that the president is wearing a mask is a huge red flag that you can't make it work.
74,70,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. A joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
77,70,"So when I said ""I don't understand why people say I like wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask for the purpose of scaring someone into thinking that they have a virus."" I said ""Some people are very curious to see what a tarot deck is about."
83,70,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus because of a mask.
85,70,"a friend of mine recently died of an apesis and a couple of months ago she got sick of them, the CDC wants to prevent them from getting the flu. The mask seems to help, so it is a joke for her to see it on a date and not to wear it if she doesn't want to wear it."
87,70,It's interesting to read this piece of paper. It's the second word in the title.
91,70,I am sorry I can't read.
70,5,The first two paragraphs are incredibly misleading.
70,8,"They only allow people to get vaccinated, but they can make a joke about people in the world that they don't want to get vaccinated. They don't want to make people sick. They want to keep people in the world and don't want to take people to a doctor for advice."
70,14,It sounds like people are trying to convince the CDC that putting a mask on is a joke and that they want to prevent the spread of the flu.
70,15,"So I'm going to start by saying ""That is a joke, but I'm not sure what the joke is about. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke."""
70,17,A lot of people in this thread are just being silly and joking about this.
70,18,"It seems that there's some kind of condescending, condescending, euphemism for this."
70,24,The president isn't a prankster. He is a prankster.
70,28,"I have a lot of questions about it. It is a joke, it is a joke because it is funny. It isn't a joke because it's a joke. People don't understand why they are a joke."
70,29,The fact that the president is wearing a mask is a huge red flag. The fact that the CDC is trying to convince the people on the list to actually get a better job.
70,33,You are using this quote to justify a joke to a stranger (not to make it sound too serious)? You were being a prank.
70,35,A prank isn't just a joke.
70,39,The CDC is not a prankster. The government is a prankster. They used a tarot card to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is a prankster.
70,42,"That's a lot of people. The only thing that makes the game interesting is that they can do things like play the game while sick, and then do the other things for fun when sick. It just makes me want to try to tell them if I am in the wrong, because it's one of the few things that I have to do."
70,48,I'm not sure how this makes sense.
70,54,That’s not funny. The CDC is not doing it at all and does not care. The CDC and the people on the list are doing it because they want people to be able to stop the spread of the AIDS.
70,59,"In my experience, a tarot card is a joke if it is used in a way to scare people into thinking it is a joke, but the actual purpose is a prank."
70,61,"It's a joke, because it's not a joke."
70,67,The joke is only a joke if they are telling a joke. The fact they are using a joke to tell it's a joke doesn't mean that they are not pranksters. There are a lot of pranks that are being made out of that. They just call it a joke and not a prank. The joke 'Is it a joke'because a lot of people are talking about it's a joke.
70,68,"if it is a prank, i'd never wear a mask at my job, because it would seem like it is the best way to do it"
74,70,So the tarot card and other things in the deck are jokes.
77,70,"The tarot is actually just a deck of cards. It tells the story of the people who died. A tarot deck is literally just a deck of cards. It tells the story of the people who died. It's one of the very few things you'll find relevant, but I'm going to be the first to say that this is a really great piece of information about the US government as a whole. I think it's good that the US is acting on this, and they have a pretty broad mandate about how to treat people."
83,70,"You have to think about how to describe this article, like this one and the other."
85,70,It's a joke. The CDC knows what they're trying to do. It's not a joke.
87,70,"This sounds like a good read to me, and I'm not sure it sounds like anything else."
91,70,"It's like saying, I'm not a nutjob, I'm a nice guy, but I'm a nice guy who's not afraid of anything. It's not a joke because it's a fact, and it's a fact."
