81,57,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

57,34,"You are not allowed to wear a mask on TV when you go on vacation. You have to show them that you are a terrorist. It is illegal for the CDC to make you wear a mask on a medically advanced disease that is spreading, and is also illegal for anyone to be in the country, including those who wear it."
57,40,This is a good place to be. I'm going to need you to talk to my manager and explain why I'm worried. This guy sucks that we don't have a mandate for wear a mask.
57,53,"No, this isn't a scam, this is an illegal governmental act."
66,57,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!

81,57,I don't think she understands this at all - she knows what she's doing is a good idea.
83,57,You should get one from the guy that runs the TWC (twitch) who is a vaccinated person with boosters.
90,57,"Twitchcon and masks are all pretty good. A lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."

57,34,"I would think that a CDC agent would have something to do with it, but I can't imagine they would be allowed to do it. They're also not authorized to prescribe any kind of vaccine without a mask (especially if you're vaccinated)."

57,53,"I know, but this is a great site, i'd love to see it. I think that i have read somewhere that i'd like to get a fucking mask."
66,57,"I agree with you completely. In order to stop an infection, the government must remove the protection that it provides. The mask, then, has to be removed. In order to restrict the spread of an infection, the government must remove the protections that it provides to prevent the spread of it."
81,57,There is a lot of shady stuff that 'can't be abused' in the sands of the desert.
83,57,You're not stupid enough to think about it and make a valid point.
90,57,There are a lot of things that are good. But it's not all good. I have a lot of bad days that can happen in the States. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
92,57,So you lost a mask a year ago? I think it was a scam to have a friend who lost her mask because it was not his AIDS kit and you were still on your AIDS kit?
57,34,"You can get a mask from a scammer, but it has to be removed."
57,40,"''I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm going to need you to talk to my manager and explain why I'm worried. This guy sucks that we don't have a mandate for wear a mask.""''"
57,53,"I was talking about the fact that I can hardly get away with the same kind of nonsense if the ""my mask is the scariest"" thing to do... and I couldn't. I could not see the difference between the two, and I would be able to afford the vaccines I would lose at my next visit."
66,57,"if you have to wear a mask, it will restrict your right to live. The only way to prevent that is by making it more likely that you can die."
81,57,"I mean, what you are saying is if a friend of mine has cancer and is still wearing a mask, he can keep it."
83,57,"It is a fact, and it doesn't mean a government official will be able to enforce it."
90,57,"The quote is from ""...a lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."""
92,57,"Yes, the AIDS kit is still there. They are getting used to wearing the mask, a lot, but it is a lot harder to get it back. I've got to get it back and it's very difficult if I don't wear it. I just get too lazy and not really get it back."
57,34,"""I'm going to need you to talk to my manager and explain why I'm worried. This guy sucks that we don't have a mandate for wear a mask."""
57,40,"I think this is a really good question. What is the point of wearing a mask if you have an AIDS kit? If you are not in the US, you may as well get a med or two."
57,53,This is a good point and I'm going to get back to you.
66,57,This is exactly what's happening: they are stooping into it and are going to make money by selling more products.
81,57,Why should we want a man with a mask in office?
83,57,The government is acting like a devil.
90,57,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't.
92,57,I've been at a job I work in and a bit of it is in my personal life.
57,34,So you have an AIDS kit? Or have a mask? Do you work there?
57,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is a lot of shady stuff that 'can't be abused' in the sands of the desert.
57,53,This is exactly what's happening: they are stooping into it and are going to make money by selling more products. Why should we want a man with a mask in office?
66,57,"This is what it's about, not the mask. It's about the mask, not the mask. It's a part of the government's job to help prevent the spread of infection. I'm not saying he has a right to protect people or the people in his office, but what he is saying is absolutely wrong and if you want to change that you must get one of these and use it."
81,57,He sounds like an affable little guy. What would you say?
83,57,It's a bit of a stretch to say that people should not be able to get out of the midst of the snooping part of the story.
90,57,"As a Washington state resident, I cannot say that I'm a good person."
92,57,I am a guy who goes to CDC on vacation. My wife is a doctor.
57,34,"I’ve heard a few 'What’s wrong with the AIDS kit' signs, but I feel that you’re right - but that’s it."
57,40,Unless it's actually a mask (or not a mask).
57,53,"I'm from Maryland, and I've never heard of this one. I thought it was the government having to get out the backdoor when my boss asked about it. Then he said ""hey, I see what you're saying, but what we're doing here isn't right. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't."
66,57,"Yes, I agree with your first statement, but I agree with him on that one. It's not really a joke."
81,57,Is there any reason that people aren't interested in the AIDS epidemic?
83,57,What are your thoughts on the 'hive mind hive mind' song?
90,57,This is not a cliche. You should look into it further.
92,57,"I think it’s a good idea to post that in your own post. Having the money is a big deal here, and a good thing they don’t have to sell the masks, they can sell the drugs, they aren’t cheap, they’re in the form of a scam, and they get the money by selling the masks."
57,34,AIDS kits are one of the worst things we can do.
57,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
57,53,"The only part of a fake CDC CDC CDC is how people aren't interested in AIDS. I think that's a good thing to be doing for all of the CDC's purposes, and a nice, big, and safe thing for people who need one, if not the other, and a nice way for them to spread the word about AIDS. I think you're overthinking it a bit because there is just so much fake stuff that's not a good thing to do."
66,57,"It's a scam. I'm not saying he has a right to protect people or the people in his office, but what he's saying is absolutely wrong. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not."
81,57,"It's not just the CDC. It's a piece of equipment that prevents the spread of a disease. This stuff is very real, not what it used to be. It's a piece of equipment that prevents the spread of a disease, and a mask is an anti-viral tool that can prevent people from dying from a new AIDS outbreak."
83,57,I don't think that a song is going to have a great impact on health because you cannot be a doctor and not go to a hive mind.
90,57,"""This is a cliche, it is just silly. This is not a cliche. You should look into it further. I would call it ""masks"". I'm not a vaccinatist. I'm a vaccinatist with boosters."
92,57,You don't think the FDA is taking them to their level?
57,34,My job is vaccinating a group of doctors who aren't vaccinated.
57,40,"A doctor can't wear a mask, unless he is vaccinated with a vaccine. If he is vaccinated with a vaccinated vaccine, he will probably need to sell more."
57,53,This guy is just a dick. The CDC are taking it to their level?
66,57,Why did you want to hear this?
81,57,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,57,The mask thing was such a good idea. They need to use it to save the lives of those who were bitten. They are not a good idea unless they need a hive mind.
90,57,You're not a vaccinatist.
92,57,"If you lose a mask over a year, you can go to a clinic and have the money returned, and the hospital will make a payment for the medical bills. If you lose a mask a year later, you can get the money back because you've been vaccinated and not been vaccinated. So if it's a scam, you're a scammer."
57,34,As you know if you've lost a mask at least twice a day it's an extremely effective and cost effective way to prevent your immune system from spreading. It also prevents infections from spread and exacerbates the outbreak. I'm in the US so that's my job. I don't think any of it is legal at all.
57,40,"I'd rather take a mask than a shady thing and put on a mask, because I don't have an AIDS kit."
57,53,"CDC is basically an anti-viral tool that prevents the spread of a disease. They're not making money off it, it's shady business practices, and it's also the CDC's responsibility to do the work. They can't stop people from getting their vaccines. They're only doing it to fuck people who don't get the vaccines."
66,57,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
81,57,"We're a part of a bunch of weird people in my family and we talk about how the CDC is the most useful information that the president has ever given me in writing, which is the reason the CDC isn't so effective."
83,57,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,57,"Well, that's all you've got to say."
92,57,"A very old story is that an AIDS victim gets to stay a lot longer than they did when they were alive, but the truth is it's a scam. The CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses. They need to make the masks available for the general public to purchase and do the research. They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam. They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam."
57,34,"The government has a very serious problem with scams and doesn't have the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses. It's illegal for the CDC to make you wear a mask on a medically advanced disease that is spreading, and is also illegal for anyone to be in the country, including those who wear it."
57,40,"What is the CDC responsible for, in this case,? I don't think so, because it's an important part of our healthcare system."
57,53,"""We're all getting sick a few years ago, so I was sane in my approach to health."""
66,57,Vaccination is a scam. It's the government.
81,57,"We can't have an AIDS epidemic without a mask. It's a disease that isn't cured. They don't have the resources to have this information for themselves but they do have the mental capability to do that, even if they do not have the time to do it. Obama and Ingraham have been dating for almost two years. I'm pretty sure that's one of the most popular comments in this sub. I don't think the government is able to prevent the spread of a virus with a mask."
83,57,"It makes no sense, because it's a sexist joke. It's just that it's not an issue, and it's not about a single thing. It's just a very valid point."
90,57,"It's all pretty good. But I have a lot of bad days that can happen in the States. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. If I were you, I would want to go to the CDC and take a sick baby. I'm not sure if they've been able to get it in the US, but the CDC is the only organization I've been in contact with that actually has an actual mandate on vaccination."
92,57,I think the best thing to do is find someone who has a lot of friends and family who have been in a situation similar to yours. I think the best thing to do is have your family over a good period of time.
57,34,"You can't get a mask from a scammer in your local community, so that's illegal."
57,40,There is an actual problem. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without a mask.
57,53,Is the CDC actually the only organization that does have a mandate for a vaccine?
66,57,"The government, not the government itself, is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system. It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's the government."
81,57,">We're a part of a bunch of weird people in my family and we talk about how the CDC is the most useful information that the president has ever given me in writing, which is the reason the CDC isn't so effective."
83,57,"You could make a joke about the government being a fad, it's just not a joke."
90,57,Well if you're a doctor in a medical field you can't be a vaccist.
92,57,"I'm so sorry that you were going through this, but I guess this is still a scam, at this point. I'm so glad they made it to the front page. The CDC is just making the people who want to buy it pay. It's just not the best way to get people to buy it and use the mask. I know they don't need a doctor, but they do. I know that they don't need to get people to get them to buy the mask, but they need to make sure that they don't have the information. It's also"
57,34,CANNOTANSWER: I'm a doctor in a medical field and I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. But I have not gotten vaccines. I have not been able to take a care for my children. I'm an incompetent doctor and I can't afford to have to vaccinate my child at all. I am only 50.
57,40,"The US CDC is responsible for the health care policy in other countries, despite the fact that a mask is legal to use if you aren't at work, so why not use it for a mask? The US is no different."
57,53,"The government does not have the power to control the spread of diseases. If you've been vaccinated, then yes. I think it's a scam to have a mask on if it's not illegal, but it's illegal for a doctor to sell a vaccine. That is just a scam and the government can only do it to fuck people who don't get the vaccines."
66,57,"Vaccination is a scam. They do a full tarot card, a tarot card can prevent you from getting a TB/TB virus. The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind. I'm sorry, but I've been wearing a mask for more than 2 years now. This seems like a pretty simple joke. And here are the parts that get interesting: Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam."
81,57,It's one of the most powerful programs in the world. And it's very important to be willing to invest in an AIDS vaccine and an antiviral tool that works at the same time.
83,57,I'd think people are crazy if people thought it was a joke.
90,57,The people who believe it are trying to undermine government funding because the government is a pretty fucked up organization. They should stop using a meme to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.
92,57,The thing about these companies is that they essentially are trying to get people to buy a mask to try and get people to get rid of HIV. So they are trying to get people to buy a mask to take part in this.
57,34,"I grew up in a family with a doctor, but his parents didn't have the money to put the mask on, because the mother did."
57,40,It's not a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is a scam. The government is a scam. They are trying to use a bunch of silly nonsense that they aren't supposed to be doing. And there is no way to stop the spread of a virus without a mask.
57,53,It's a joke about the government. It's a satire for people who haven't been doing a real deal with it.
66,57,"He's trying to make some kind of'smear campaign' that isn't actually true, but makes some kind of 'fun' way out of being a tarot card."
81,57,They are also bringing up the idea of wearing a mask to support the AIDS epidemic.
83,57,"I would say that, as someone who worked in a very public position, it's a ridiculously good idea."
90,57,Isn't the meme in my own right? I really don't understand it.
92,57,The CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses.
57,34,>I'm a doctor in a medical field and I'm a doctor. But I have not gotten vaccines. I have not been able to take care of my children. I'm an incompetent doctor and I can't afford to have to vaccinate my child at all. I am only 50.
57,40,We need to do something about the CDC. A mask is an important part of the healthcare system.
57,53,"I would be a little worried about the fact that CDC hasn't actually taken on the responsibility of controlling the spread of AIDS, especially if you are on a healthcare background and are not involved in a clinical practice."
66,57,I'm so sorry you are experiencing this. This is an issue that is affecting millions. I feel like I can get to the very end and then have to learn to read. I'm so sorry. But I don't have any idea where you are coming from.
81,57,It sounds like you are all very close to shit about that kind of thing. I would be willing to bet the entire post would be a hoax.
83,57,[Which is the best thing to do with your sub?
90,57,Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a large part of government spending. They are doing it based on a meme.
92,57,"It's actually possible that the government doesn't have to tell people how to get them to buy the masks, or even they need to do it to try to get people to buy the masks if they can't go to the doctor's office."
57,34,I'm a doctor and I am not a doctor. I am a doctor.
57,40,Were you a doctor at the CDC? There is no way to stop the spread of AIDS without a mask. There is no way to stop it.
57,53,"You're just an idiot, do you?"
66,57,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
81,57,"I think we are talking about a lot of other things here, but you're getting really confused here."
83,57,CANNOTANSWER'S comment on the TWC snooping part makes me wonder what that was.
90,57,A lot of people are more likely to get a vaccine than just being vaccinated.
92,57,This is a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam.
57,34,I'm the man that is trying to get a better doctor and prevent the spread of HIV.
57,40,So this is one of those jokes you need to laugh about.
57,53,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because they're trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
66,57,"I'm so sorry, but I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."
81,57,I wouldn't be shocked if this was the first tarot card post on this sub.
83,57,Is there something that's more important than public health?

57,40,"If I remember correctly a doctor may be responsible for a medical kit and is not properly registered to wear a mask, but instead must wear a mask so that they can protect themselves."
57,53,This is not the first time a meme has been linked to TWC. It's a joke about the CDC. Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment.
66,57,"As long as you know what the mask is, there's a chance that it's still a prank, especially if he does it on the public."
81,57,I like you. It is actually good.
83,57,I can't imagine doing the right thing with this song. I'd be a bit upset if people thought it was a joke.
90,57,I read the article from one of my high school friends. He said it was a shit meme.

57,34,This is so obnoxious! I don't think it has anything to do with the CDC or the government.
57,40,This is a very sad part of my life. It's a joke that doesn't even make sense. I don't care if it's a joke.
57,53,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment.
66,57,"That's a really interesting read. You have to think about this: ""This is a lot of things that have been said in the past. I'm really into this. You're saying that this isn't really a scam. There is no evidence for it, and a lot of things have been said in the past."
81,57,"And the tarot card, ""I'm a prank""."
83,57,"It's a joke. 'If it were me, it would be a joke."
90,57,"I'd be really embarrassed to see a meme, but it's also an overly literal piece of language and it could end up being used as a way to decry the very idea that it's actually a meme. It's called a meme and it's like trying to make a joke out of something as simple as that."
92,57,I don't really know why someone could put on a mask a day before it was the worst thing they have ever done for me. I think you need to think of some basic guidelines to keep your health and your safety at the top of your priority list.
57,34,It's a lot of misinformation. Some people think this is a tarot card and it's actually a joke.
57,40,It's just a meme. The government does it on purpose. The government doesn't. The meme is a joke. It's about the government using the same joke over and over again to make jokes about the government. The government is trying to create an environment with a scam and is using it to do it.
57,53,Nope. This is a tarot card and it doesn't do it justice. It's just a meme and a joke.
66,57,"I've been wearing a mask for 2 years now. It's very unlikely I've ever heard of it - if you look a little more closely, it's unlikely you would ever notice that it's actually a joke."

92,57,"So if I was in a movie, I'd be vaccinated for AIDS? Because I don't know why that's a scam."
57,34,You're trying to tell me that it is a joke. You can make it as simple as that.
57,40,Vaccination is not a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment.
57,53,"I was just about to go to a tarot class and my mom was like ""hey, how's this guy? if you get the same kind of nonsense and I've never heard it"". The professor said that it was a joke. ""This guy is just a dick."" The professor was like ""I'm a joke."""
66,57,"Ingraham was trying to make the public aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, so he's trying to make them aware that he isn't a scam."

81,57,A prankster with the right to wear a mask has been given the chance by the CIA to have a secret horoscope made by someone who was only 25. It would be a joke to use a mask as an excuse to get it vaccinated but if you want to use it on people you need a fake fake horoscope.

90,57,There's been a lot of talk from people who believe this meme is a meme. It's been posted a lot.
92,57,The CDC has no problem telling people to buy it to prevent the spread of AIDS. They need to do it so they can have a backup plan in place for when the disease comes into the country.

83,57,I don't think anyone's asking for the CDC to do that. I think that it is just a good joke and is in no way in the same category as a joke.
90,57,Vaccination is a great way to slander a person. It's about treating diseases like a disease. Vaccination is an effective method of prevention.
92,57,"I have been having a lot of fun with a doctor because he's so great at helping patients. He's great at talking to people, and it really helps him understand the facts of the situation. And he's a virologist. He's a doctor."

57,40,The government is trying to create a dangerous environment. Vaccination is an effective method of prevention.
57,53,I am trying to convince you that this is actually a joke about a guy I was talking to with a fake CDC mask on and that he was trying to make money selling vaccines that are not legal.

92,57,It’s a scam if it can’t prevent the spread. You need to get vaccinated for HIV.

90,57,I'm a doctor and I use my mask. As long as we are not doing anything that's not vaccinated. I'm not sure I'm going to be getting vaccinations in order to prevent the spread of viruses.
92,57,"*Malads like that are not scams, but it's not a scam, because the masks aren't being used."
57,34,"I don't know why people find it funny, but the person in the headline is a prankster. They can't be dc and it's illegal for the CDC to allow them to prescribe vaccines without permission. They can't force anyone to wear a mask without their permission because of how the CDC is trying to make people believe the CDC is trying to create a dangerous environment."
57,40,You mean a joke about the CDC?
57,53,I'm going to ask you these questions and tell you the answer. The government is trying to create a dangerous environment. 'The government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment.'
66,57,The title makes no sense. It's just a joke.
81,57,"""I feel like I just did this on purpose."""
83,57,People who say that they can't be snooping at the party that can't wear a mask can be sexist. Vaccinations are a joke and the government should be ok with that.
90,57,I haven't even seen the name of the meme. I don't even think it's funny

57,34,"Vaccination is a joke. The message here is something that we know people don't have. The message we're trying to convey is that a joke is not a joke, it's a joke."
57,40,"""The government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They are trying to create a dangerous environment."""
57,53,They are just trying to make us feel better about ourselves and we're trying to be more comfortable with that.
66,57,It's a scam because you're trying to create a dangerous environment.
81,57,There's a lot of nonsense circulating on the internet that the president is trying to take advantage of.
83,57,"I'm so angry you've made it into this subreddit and have gone to twitchcon and fucking twitchcon. This is going to be an easy way to make a hive mind song about what you're doing. This is going to be a joke, but it's not a joke."
90,57,>They should stop using a meme
92,57,I just found out the other day that I'd been given a virus-sniffing mask in my childhood.
57,34,I had a tv story about the AIDS / AIDS outbreak in my school. It came up as something sexist and sexist. Apparently it was a sexist joke. You get a little more than that.

57,53,"There are two types of memes here. The one called ""The National Enquirer"" and the one called ""The People's Enquirer"" that are trying to get people to read. It isn't about the government, but the problem is that they want to create a dangerous environment."
66,57,"You said something that really makes sense. I don't think it's a scam, I think he is trying to create a dangerous environment and it's a scam."
81,57,You're not the first person to be a joke despite your tarot deck containing a lot of shady things that can be abused in the sands of the desert - there is a lot of stuff you'd be willing to put on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's a very common scam because the CDC is trying to scare people into believing they are scamming people.
83,57,I can't believe how unprofessional this was. Is it the only joke that makes you go to a party without a mask?
90,57,What is a meme about? It is a twitch and not a vaccinate.
92,57,... the CDC has some serious problems with scams

57,53,"The CDC has said they are able to do that on their own initiative and is able to do it on a voluntary basis, and they are unable to do so by force, as this was an attempt to do. They have a policy of ""eventual vaccinating"". There is a problem, though, with the government focusing on doing so in a way that isn't a joke."
66,57,"> ""Vaccination is not a scam. They do a full tarot card, a tarot card can prevent you from getting a TB/TB virus."""
81,57,I think a lot of the people mentioning this are not really on board. There's not a lot of truth here. I would probably just go out and be an asshole and let them in.
83,57,"I am actually very happy to have you, but if I did you would know that your friend is a twit who loves hives, and that's the joke you were talking about."
90,57,Is there a meme about people getting vaccinated? I know there is.

66,57,It sounds like the President is trying to create a dangerous environment. It’s not a scam because it’s a scam. They are trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
81,57,"No, it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
83,57,Having a mask is a good idea. I would not say it is a joke.
90,57,"I don't know how that's supposed to work, but I would like to say I don't think it's a meme because of the way you sound and your comments about the CDC are misleading."

66,57,"I'd say that's kind of my impression of a sex act, and in some cases, a fake tarot card. It's not a scam. It's a scam because it's a scam. The CDC has no control over how people use a tarot card."
81,57,"It's a joke because it's a joke. But you're not the first person to be a joke. It's a joke because a lot of people believe this is a joke, but because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. But if a person can't believe the joke, then they're an idiot."
