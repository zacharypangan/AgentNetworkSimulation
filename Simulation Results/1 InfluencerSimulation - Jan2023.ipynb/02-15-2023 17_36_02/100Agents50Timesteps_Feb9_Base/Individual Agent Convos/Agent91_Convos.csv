91,30,He said he'd like to go out to eat. But he also said that it's the best way to explain this to people.
91,31,"What did a woman do with the mask? He said: ""Second of all: Do you like to wear masks or do you prefer to wear them?"""
91,32,"...I have to wear a mask when I'm not eating, I have to wear it when I'm not eating. I don't want to be seen in the crowd I don't want to be around them."
91,35,I think the 'Mask us to wear a mask' is just a way of making fun of the people who don't wear a mask because that is what they're saying. I'm going to try and explain how it sucks that the government is pushing people into wearing a mask when they are able to see things without it.
91,39,"OP, you are not being sarcastic and are a bit naive. This is an extremely difficult thing to do."
91,42,"This is an awful way to explain this to someone. 'Having a mask is one of the dumbest things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask,"
91,65,"He's saying it is not an easy thing to do and not that they want to prevent it from spreading, but that the government is trying to do something about it."
91,66,Is there a wikipedia page about this?
91,70,"So I'm not an expert on the virus, but I do wear a mask every day."
91,77,"It is illegal to put on a mask to stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS. It is illegal to use that word in public. People have no way to know that this is legal, but in reality it is illegal to put on a mask to help stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS."
91,83,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it sucks that it's a necessary evil to make you feel uncomfortable. But if I was a military officer in the Vietnam war, I'd probably put a mask on."
91,86,The people that think you are in the minority are the ones that think you can't be a good person without a mask. This is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
96,91,This is just a joke - and it's not really sexist.
91,2,"oh god, you're a horrible person. I know you have a dick, but I do know you don't, so why is everyone in your group here on reddit referring to you as ""dumb"", while I don't know people who aren't."
91,9,"In the UK, there is no such thing as a ""sexy"" hive mind. It's like an emulsion of a sexy, or ""fuck that shit"". It is more likely it is a mask that's merely worn by men who aren't dressed, so they aren't in the minority. It can also include a hive mind."
91,10,"He said the same thing about the government's plan: ""Putting on a mask will stop the spread of a virus. That's a lot of BS. The government should be doing it all to stop the spread of a virus."

91,31,So......'I have been wearing a mask for almost two years now. I wear it daily and I always wear it when I can.'
91,32,"""It is not an easy thing to do and not that they want to prevent it from spreading, but that the government is trying to do something about it."
91,35,A mask would be the most naive thing to do to anyone that wants to wear one.

91,42,Having a big restaraunt is the ugliest thing I have ever done This is why we all wear masks.
91,65,"It's a big red flag, a fucking lie, and a very stupid one."
91,66,"I believe the fact that they are trying to bring attention to the issue is sexist, because if he isn't a huge fan of the idea of a mask, he isn't a fan of the idea of a mask."

91,86,"So, ""Your wife is having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
96,91,I really think that the reason this is a joke is because I don't believe it. You don't believe it.
91,2,"I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. But a mask is only necessary for a certain amount of time (one minute) and it is very expensive, so I can't imagine wearing a mask to be the most expensive thing to do in my life."

If that was the case, then I wouldn't be wearing a mask, but a mask for people with HIV/AIDS would be the best thing I've ever done, even if it's for the sake of being in the minority."
91,31,You don't want the government to do something about it. Your wife can't really do anything about it. The government wants to do it to stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS.
91,32,"I walked through this place two years ago and it was really nice. I had a very sexy hive mind. I did it because I had heard that you'd eat in your pants and when you had to be dressed, you'd get into a fucking fight. It was my dream to do this, and I just wanted to put the mask on instead of getting up. And it was the worst thing I did in my entire life and I didn't want to feel like a dick-suck."
91,35,I haven't found any kind of hive mind.
91,39,"I don't like wearing a mask, but I love it. I do wear it when I'm not eating. I have to wear it when I'm not in the crowd I don't want to be around them. I have to wear it when I'm not eating.

91,42,I'm gonna go get a picture of you putting on a mask. You've been done enough. You've been done enough. You've done enough. You're done enough. You've done enough. You don't deserve a face-to-face conversation. You've been done enough. You're done enough. You've done enough. You deserve more. You deserve better. You deserve better.

91,77,"I don't really see why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do. Rather a ""righteous"" thing to do. Especially when it involves doing a lot of stuff like doing ""sexy things"" and ""sexy things"", like you are."
91,83,There's no right or wrong in this post to use a fad to stop the spread of a virus. The government should not be able to make that use of a fad so there's no reason not to put on a mask. The government can't do that to stop the spread of a virus.
91,86,"I don't think the wiki article is being particularly interesting, but that is just because the people here are not that familiar with it."
96,91,I can't believe the hive mind. It is a joke. I can't believe a little bit of it.
91,2,"A lot of the people I've been talking about have been very negative, and you're not right to say anything sexist and offensive."

91,10,You did the right thing - your wife needs a lawyer.
91,30,"He's not making this up. He's telling people to do the right thing and if you're not comfortable with it, there's not much you can do and you can do it."
91,31,"The government has been tying this stuff up for more than 3000 years. The fad is just about the masks they put on, ensuring there are only a few people in the world who aren't wearing it if they're being exposed to the fad. That's about as many as you can imagine and that's it."
91,32,"I'm just going to say what I know isn't what I am talking about. I am being jaded. I am putting on a mask for the sake of having sex. I am the best thing I have ever done, even if it's for the sake of being in the minority."
91,35,The wiki article says there is no'sexy hive mind' in the UK.
91,39,I'd imagine a mask would make your life easier if you put on a mask to stop people from getting HIV/AIDS.
91,42,"I'm not sure what he means. I've seen people have it. I can't imagine putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when they get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""

91,66,So... What's this guy saying about putting on a mask?
91,70,That's what I meant.
91,77,A mask for people with HIV is also illegal. It's the one for a few people who just want to stop being exposed to it.
91,83,I can't even begin to understand how they think wearing a mask is dumb.
91,86,">I don't really see why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do."
96,91,... the worst part is that the people that don't know the meaning of hive mind know a lot more about their masks than they really do. They don't know anything about the fact that it is just a joke. The whole thing seems like a joke.
91,2,I think it's because of the fact that the hive mind is about ensuring the only people that aren't wearing it would be being exposed to it. But why is it not a joke that you should put on a mask.
91,9,"I’m not sure what he was going to say here, but it's more likely a joke than a joke. It’s not a joke, but it might be just a joke."
91,10,It's hard to explain why people think that masks are the one thing that prevents people from getting HIV/AIDS.
91,30,"If you wear a mask to get out and then get off, do so on purpose and you'll have a lot of fun with it."
91,31,"It is a fad and not one of those things. It's just that people want people to have sex, and that people are so sexy they don't wear masks, and that people want people to put on them, and that people need a lawyer. It doesn't matter if someone is in a fight with a government who wants to make the public feel uncomfortable with their own choices, but that's no reason to keep it on them."
91,32,"[I don't really see why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do."
91,35,"There's a lot of people here who think the government is pushing people to wear a mask to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They aren't all like, ""Oh, I'm so embarrassed to be wearing a mask."""
91,39,A mask for people with HIV is also illegal. It's the one for a few people who just want to stop being exposed to it. The government has been tying this stuff up for more than 3000 years. The hive mind is the one that has the sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest
91,42,"In order to have a good conversation about the dangers of wearing a mask, you have to say:"
91,65,"The article says there is no ""sexy hive mind"". It's like an emulsion of a sexy, or ""fuck that shit"". It's more likely it is a mask that's merely worn by men who aren't dressed, so they aren't in the minority. It can also include a hive mind."

91,70,It's not a joke. It's a fact.
91,77,"I didn't read this article because I have a sex book. The article is a joke, that's a good one."
91,83,"I had a resurrectionist job where I put on a mask for a couple weeks after my amputation, and then immediately had to be hysterical about the health of my wife. I was diagnosed with HIV and the amputation was the symptom. I was so empathetic about it, and I did a lot of stupid things as well. My wife told me that I did not want to do a resurrectionist job because I didn't like to be put on a mask as a fucking thing. I did some"
91,86,>A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,91,...and then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,2,I think a lot of things are sexist and offensive. People are in an argument because there are reasons they are so sexist and offensive.
91,9,You've got to read the whole article to know if it really is a joke or not.
91,10,"A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A mask for people with HIV is also illegal.

91,30,"I am sorry but I want to point out that this isn't a joke, it's an example of how people don't actually want to do the right thing and they don't realize what it means. I'm not sure it is anything else but that's just what I am saying."
91,31,You want a lawyer? The government isn't in a position to do anything about it.
91,32,"I really don't see why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do. It's just that people want people to have sex, and that people are so sexy they don't wear masks, and that people want people to put on them, and that people need a lawyer. It's hard to explain why people think that masks are the one thing that prevents people from getting HIV/AIDS."
91,35,I think a hive mind would be a funny joke but it's not. People with HIV are largely not in the minority. And they also have a really bad memory of the virus. It's basically a joke.
91,39,A man with a mask is the next best thing he'll ever need to do.

91,70,"It’s very well formulated and can be applied to a multitude of subjects: human psychology, physics, psychology, feminism, etc."
91,77,I think that's really interesting to hear.
91,83,That isn't the worst part. It is just that the only people who wear a mask are a few people who aren't comfortable with it.
91,86,It's a joke.
96,91,"I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a doctor. If I ever do this to a child, I will put them on."

91,32,...the government is trying to do something about it.
91,35,I have a bit of HIV apk and it's hard to explain. I have had it for over a year and it has always been pretty funny to read.
91,39,It was also used by some of the most well known people in the US who don't understand what they are saying and aren't very familiar with the subject.
91,42,They use a bit of a jingle.
91,65,"It's a joke, not a joke. It is one of the stupidest things you could possibly do."
91,66,I'm going to say: It's not a joke. It's a fact. I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. It's a joke.

91,83,"I can't tell if this is a joke, or if it is a fact. You know, if you're a ninja and want to do something against a woman who tries to use a mask for the reason he's describing, you can put on a mask."
91,86,i don't think anyone can say it's a joke
96,91,">I am a doctor, and I'm not a doctor. If I ever do this to a child, I will put them on."
91,2,"You are correct, a mask isn't a joke. A ninja does a certain thing to get his or her dick off of it so that it will be seen as a pain. It's also a sign that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."

91,70,"The man wearing the mask, for example, had a small hole in his face, which had a very large hole in his chest. In his case, he was a doctor. I know it sounds silly, but I think he just didn't want to see a man with a mask, which is what he did to a few other men. I don't think he knew what he was doing."
91,77,I don't think there's a single other example of the actual point of wearing a mask. It's an example of how people don't actually want to do the right thing and they don't realize what it means.

91,42,I think it is a joke. I think you're really crazy for putting on a mask. I think I would probably put a mask on.
91,65,"It's the same as the first thing you should know. If a doctor says something like 'If a man wears a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then takes it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask' then the doctor says ""it is a joke, but a fact.

91,10,"You're telling me that the joke in this sub is being taken to the extreme because people don't like the idea of ""a ninja"" is the one that is so disgusting and ignorant."

91,32,That was a joke and not a joke.
91,35,I have a friend with HIV who is putting on a mask for a meeting and in some cases he wears a mask as well. And he is a military man.
91,39,... if it's a joke... you need to see it a few times and really look at it as a little piece of a jingle.
91,42,Having a big restaraunt is the dumbest thing that I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
91,65,It's a joke. They don't understand why people wear masks.
91,66,Having the facts and humour of a real world story.
91,70,I think it's a joke because it is a jingle.
91,77,It sounds like someone was mentioning a joke about an American officer who was not a ninja. But it's not a joke.
91,83,"I'm not saying this is a joke, just that it sounds more like it's a joke."
91,86,You're just saying that you're having trouble getting through this. You think the whole thing has been in a wiki post. They're not joking. They're not taking the risk of being a racist.
96,91,This is why I love these comments.
91,2,It sounds like the people that were trying to make a joke about the government are being trolled.
91,9,"People do these things for fun. They say a mask to eat, but not to be a ninja, they're just putting on a mask to be more of a nutjob."

91,30,The other person is probably not joking.
91,31,"I am a military guy, so I don't know the name of what this person is talking about."
91,32,There's also the question of why people think it's wrong to wear a mask when they're not eating.
91,35,"The question is ""What is the biggest problem with wearing a mask"" that's not answered?"
91,39,That's exactly what I've been telling myself.
91,42,"The best thing about putting on a mask is if you don't want to be in the room. When you go to see a video of your mates putting on a mask, they are going to be in the room."
91,65,I think a lot of people should know this. I'm not sure what I'd like to do with this because it's ridiculous and ridiculous.

96,91,I was thinking about putting on a mask for a friend who had a hive mind.
91,2,"I'm gonna say, 'Hey, I've been talking about this for a lot of years.'"
91,9,"The thing is, I don't really see the point of putting on a mask, but I think it's just because I don't see what it means."
91,10,The post is being taken to the extreme because people don't know what a ninja's attitude is. I think that people whose masks do not protect them from the government will inevitably wear them.
91,30,"""I'm a jingle."
91,31,"The thing that's a joke is that the headline doesn't actually imply that people are putting on a mask and taking off the mask, but it does suggest that people are putting on masks to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
91,32,"I've been a social worker for almost 2 years. I wear a mask when I'm not eating, and then take it off when I'm not eating. I don't want to be seen in the crowd I don't want to be around them."
91,35,I know you are just being a little nitpicky. I'm going to do some research on the subject and try to guess where the joke is going.
91,39,">The problem is that people don't know what a hive mind is. It sounds like a joke,"
91,42,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
91,65,"> ""I'm not a doctor but I am a doctor who is using a mask on himself to protect him."","
91,66,"I'm not a racist, but I get this..."
91,70,I think this is what is really interesting about the article.
91,77,"It is a joke, and I'd put on a mask if I were a human being in the hospital."
91,83,""" I'm so sorry, it’s been so long, and I’ve gotten it down."""
91,86,"A ""Joke"" is a joke because it's a joke. It's a jingle because it's a jingle."
96,91,"People use ""Hive Mind"" as a joke. In my opinion it's more of a joke than a joke."
91,2,It sounds like you're a troll and you know I'm not going to be an expert on what is funny and offensive. People are in an argument because there are reasons they are so sexist and offensive.
91,9,"I'd probably put on a mask for a prank, but I would be scared. I think you might have been a little nitpicky."
91,10,[The question is about who is a joke. [What are the ten ft people going to do for their lives and why should they be allowed to wear masks because they would have to protect them from the government](https://www.nsa.gov/hhs/)](https://www.nsa.gov/hss/hsa-info/nasa/hsa/)

91,31,"What’s the joke? It’s just a joke, because it’s funny."
91,32,I don't have a big problem with this. This doesn't make sense at all.
91,35,There is not a big difference between a 'jingle' and 'joke'. A 'jingle' is a joke. It's a jingle because it's a joke. People use it as a joke. I'm going to do some research on the subject and try to guess where the joke is going.
91,39,You haven’t talked to me about it. It’s a joke. It sounds like a joke. It’s a joke. It sounds like a joke.
91,42,That is what a hive mind is. It's a jingle. 'Tis just because people don't know what a hive mind is.
91,65,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
91,66,The whole thing is a joke and I have no idea why people are putting on masks. The joke was made about how the government uses their own method to stop HIV/AIDS to fight off a nihilism of a bunch of people.
91,70,So I'm going to go from my post that's not a joke to a joke a few hundred times? I'm not going to go to the doctor and see a doctor.
91,77,"""I don't really see what the point of this is."
91,83,"It's really silly to not put on a mask, as that's not something that everyone else is supposed to do. You've done it enough to think it was a joke. If it were a joke."
91,86,"A ""Joke"" is a joke. It's a joke because it's a jingle. It's a jingle. It's a jingle. It's a joke because it's a joke."
96,91,"My favorite thing about this is that I think a few people might be like, ""But that's not a joke. I think it makes you feel a little dicky, but I don't see how a joke would be funny, especially if it's something I've seen before."""
91,2,"I feel like when you tell a joke you're putting on a mask because it's funny and makes you think, ""What are you going to do for your life and why should they be allowed to wear a mask because it's a joke?"" you give a jingle because you don't want to say anything, so you take a jingle out of that."
91,9,I've been on the sidelines of many conversations containing something like this for a few years. I have a feeling this was going to be too much work. I'm gonna sit down and watch a couple of episodes to get a good idea of what the joke is.
91,10,So what does wearing a mask in your job mean?
91,30,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""
91,31,This is a sexist joke.
91,32,I’m gonna have to make it a little more specific by saying you don’t want to be around people at all.
91,35,"a jingle is a joke, but a jingle is a joke."
91,39,"So, what do the jokes have to do with HIV, and how do the jokes compare to a joke?"
91,42,"And then when he asks for it he says: ""Ow I'm not so sorry you've been done enough. I've done enough. You're done enough. You deserve better. You deserve better. You deserve better. You deserve better. You deserve better. You deserve better."""
91,65,"I like to wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. I always have to wear it when I'm not eating. I always have to wear it when I'm not eating. I don't want to be seen in public, but I don't like to be around people. I also don't know the joke that makes a joke."
91,66,I'd like to mention one more fact: This is why the government and the government are trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.
91,70,People used to joke about people in the military and the fact that it's not a joke.
91,77,I haven't read the article but it sounds like it was a joke. The whole idea of people getting on the street is crazy.
91,83,I don't see why this is a joke.
91,86,"[NAME] jokingly says, ""Hey, I was just talking about how stupid I am, but I thought it was hilarious."""
96,91,A friend of mine did this with a mask in 1868. He had no idea why. He was so confused. He was a doctor and still had a pretty good hive mind.
91,2,"I've read the articles on the subject. They all make me think that people are trying to get away with it. They don't see the joke being serious but they know people are talking about it a lot. I can't even start to think that the actual joke is a joke, and they seem to be trying to get rid of some of the sexist stuff in a lot of ways that have no practical application."
91,9,"I don't know why this is getting downvoted, but when he tells you about a new joke he's joking about a fact. You're just going to take a little while to get to know what the joke is about and see if it's a joke."
91,10,So the whole thing is a joke. I just wanted to know what it means a joke and not a joke.
91,30,This is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
91,31,OP is a total dick and a nutbag.

91,35,"You're not being nitpicky, but I think it's a joke, because a joke doesn't have anything to do with the spread of the disease, and it is not a joke, so it doesn't have to be about a problem. It's about the ""jingle"" making a joke and then telling them, ""I don't like to be around people. I'm a guy. I don't like being around people.

91,39,"No, no. Especially not for the context."

91,66,"> 'I think it's not a joke, but a fact. It's hard to explain why people think putting on a mask is a joke. It's a joke because people do not take the risks of being racist."
91,70,The idea of people getting on the street is just an odd joke.
91,77,"Its not a joke, but a joke is a joke. You're probably thinking that's a jingle?"
91,83,I would be very uncomfortable wearing a mask if someone were to take my wife and a doctor to the hospital.

91,32,I have to say that I love the idea of putting on a mask to keep people on their feet. When I feel it's being too harsh and putting on a mask it makes me a little afraid to put on something.
