38,37,The official comments about wearing a mask are all about the virus. I believe the mask is for someone who has gotten vaccinated.
44,38,I think I can help here.
45,38,It's the best thing for everyone to do. It's just not inherently bad. It's an awful thing.
52,38,"There is only one person in this thread who has said anything about not wearing a mask, and you know it."
53,38,"I don't know if you're in the US but I'm not a federal official, and i was told I couldn't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."
62,38,I can't stand a politician being able to refuse to wear a mask.
65,38,I'm gonna say this about twitchcon and masks... You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates You can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters I'm not sure if the state town doesn't have an mandates. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
75,38,I was a vaccinated person.
38,6,"I can't see that going to a state fair without a mask is illegal, and if you look closely at it you can see that people who get vaccinated aren't the ones that get the disease. There are no mandatory helmets available."
38,13,I live in Colorado. It's not too far from there.
38,16,"I do not like wearing masks in public, but I do wear a mask when I do not want to leave. I do not wear my mask when I go out, and if it is necessary to keep the game, I don't wear it."

38,28,"It would be better for the guy wearing the mask to stand in front of his opponent's face instead. It's as if he's gonna put him in the position of the best possible leader. If he's not on it, you're in the position of the best he can possibly be. But he's not at all. If he isn't, why don't you resign and not support his efforts?"
38,32,"If you don't want to wear a mask, and are getting vaccinated, you should get a medical emergency kit (no masks), or get a dental kit. There's no need to wear a mask. The medical staff and physicians will all have to work with a licensed health care professional. And if it doesn't, the public safety standards may not apply."
38,37,I'm a federal official and I can only help you by saying you like the person in the comments?

62,38,"This was very unrelated and I’ve written it before as an excuse to use the ""I can’t stand a politician being able to refuse to wear a mask."""

38,17,> The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
38,21,I don't think you need to wear a mask anymore.
38,28,"You should talk to your local county government about the problem of this, I'm sure they have an appropriate sign with a bunch of different signs."
38,32,>An issue with the government has no bearing on it.
38,37,You don't need a mask. It's just more to protect yourself and the opponents from the virus.
44,38,What is the definition of a mask?
45,38,"It's not bad to wear a mask, but it's a way to prevent it from spreading, and it can actually help prevent the spread of a virus. It's also a good way to prevent the spread of a virus in general."
52,38,"The problem with that is that it's a joke. Not something you get to see in the media or any other publication, just a thing you do to prevent the spread of a virus."

75,38,"The only thing that can avert the twitch crowd from waking up to my mask. That's a pretty sexist euphemism. The issue with the government has no bearing on it. I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a very liberal, not black person."
38,6,Why does the guy with the mask wear a mask?
38,13,"I'm also a redditor, and I find it odd that the issue is with the government. If the government isn't going to sabotage it, we should be able to get rid of it. The issue is with the government."
38,16,I think it's a good idea to use it a lot more for a reason.

38,21,This is the one thing I am concerned about.
38,28,"I'm a very liberal, not black person and I don't think anyone can really use a mask. I think a mask is more like a mask to protect you. It's about a way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's supposed to protect the players from the viruses, so it doesn't work in most situations."
38,32,"Well, I've been to many festivals and festivals. Well, I personally like the ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign. But that doesn't mean you have to do it.

45,38,"The problem with this is that your team needs a lot of resources to get it off the ground. Your team needs a lot of resources to get it off, but that's no excuse to not wear one. You just want to get it off before the next one."
52,38,You are the only person that knows how to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. Do you think that's the joke?
53,38,"I think the best I could do is try and explain to the person on this sub that it's a good idea to take something from the Internet and say if they don't like it, they should stop being a part of the government, as a result. That's the kind of thing that a lot of people don't understand."
62,38,"I am not a government official. I know that you are unaffected by the situation, and that's a legitimate reason to not wear a mask. The fact that you are a black woman is very worrying. I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask actually count if you are a doctor? So in your case, you're going to get a new one?"
65,38,"I am in the UK and have a doctor. i wear a mask when my face gets sore and i can't tell if i want to go to work with them because it makes me sick. I can't believe that the government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them. Is the government making sure that no one wears a mask, or are you saying ""i'm a nurse"" when you're doing this?"
75,38,> The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak. It’s not really a scam. I’ve only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. It’s a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks.
38,6,I feel like you're very much over thinking this.
38,13,It's possible to get a cloak and put it on the table or something.
38,16,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke about people who don't want to wear a mask, like the people who don't want to wear masks."
38,17,"Honestly, if I were a politician, I would wear a mask unless it has a government mandate. If it's not mandated, it wouldn't be a good idea to wear a mask and then wear a mask unless they're mandated by law to wear it. I would just not want to wear a mask."
38,21,It's the only way to keep yourself safe and secure.
38,28,"""The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak. It’s not really a scam. I’ve only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. It’s a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks."""
38,32,The wiki article says that the issue is with the government.
38,37,"This is not a new thing, but it is a way of looking at it."
44,38,The people who grew up in the US who grew up in countries with masks are the most ill people. We have to wear them and not be forced into it.
45,38,My husband is in the middle of a cold and he wore a mask when his mother was not on.
52,38,There is a joke about being able to wear a mask.
53,38,"> I mean, the ""why"" of being able to put on a mask and get around it and walk on it. Unless they want to protect you from it, I'd just let you go. I've gotten a lot of bad information. Thats why I wear a mask."
62,38,"I thought this was about the government, not the twitchcon euphemism."
65,38,It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system. It's because there's so little public space to do things that aren't very useful. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,38,> Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
38,6,"I think the problem here is the government has done so much, and is currently in the midst of making many a claim that it is not helping with HIV prevention."
38,13,The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them. It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
38,16,"I am a lawyer, so I am not sure I understand your question. The government has been very clear about this for some time now, including allowing a large number of 'common sense' and 'the public' as a whole."
38,17,Is there a government mandate to shave off your face?
38,21,"Honestly, if I were a politician, I would wear a mask unless it has a government mandate. If it's not mandated, it's not a good idea to wear a mask, or have someone get away with that."
38,28,"> I am not a government official. I know that you are unaffected by the situation, and that's a legitimate reason to not wear a mask."
38,32,"I think the question is is what if anyone is trying to be a joke in the face of a virus? That's not a joke, but the idea of them being the most dangerous shit on earth. It's just not the people who want to go out there with a mask and suck at it."
38,37,> Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
44,38,"If the US government doesn't want to help, then I don't see a problem with them. There is a problem because of the CDC and the public health profession. You can see the problem, the problem is the government has to help."
45,38,"I think if this were a fad in the media, I’d be a real hypocrite."
52,38,Is this a misunderstanding of the AIDS epidemic?
53,38,>But what about those pranks and rumors of the virus? Thats a good point.
62,38,CANNOTANSWER](http://www.reddit.com/r/Renaissance_Relationships) is a very popular meme to comment on.
65,38,Is this a new kind of fucking joke?
75,38,[Ms. Ingraham] (http://www.nolo.gov/police/police-discrimination-politics.html) said they were taking the money from people who are already infected and are still infected. The CDC says that the government will not reimburse vaccinated people.
38,6,"I would say that this ad is about the government, not the CDC. There's a lot of public information available that CDC doesn't have to offer the public at the time. I think it's just a joke."
38,13,In the future the CDC will tell the people in need to keep vaccinating others that are sick.
38,16,""" I think it's a good idea to use it a lot more for a reason. I can say that i personally like the ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign."

38,32,I don't think you're misunderstanding it. You don't know the situation. This is a fad that they're taking money from people who are infected and are still infected. The CDC says that the government won't reimburse vaccinated people.
38,37,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""this is not a new thing, but it is a way of looking at it.

44,38,"Why isn't it called a ""Motor-Death-Failure""?"
45,38,"I'm so sorry. Vaccines are not on the US national market, so this is a bad idea."
52,38,What's the problem with this?
53,38,"Why are people ignoring the issues and complaining that it's a problem for us? Because when I go to the gym or the gym I always have a pair of gloves and a pair of eye contact gloves, and they can prevent people from talking to me. The best part is the fact that the mask is not necessary to prevent people from saying ""I can't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."""

38,6,"If you want to avoid misunderstanding the AIDS epidemic, you've made it clear in the headline that it is NOT a joke. And if you do get sick, why are you going to get sick? It doesn't matter if you got sick, just tell me why."
38,13,"There is a lot of evidence that the CDC does not want to give people the right to wear them. The CDC has been arguing that it is not helping with HIV prevention, and in fact they are trying to prevent the spread of it."

38,28,I'm so sorry. There's a lot of public information available that CDC doesn't have to offer the public at the time.
38,32,"It seems like there is a whole lot of troll going on here. There are people that are all over the place, and they're trying to get infected. This is a fad."
38,37,Vaccines are not on the US national market. The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them.
44,38,"Because, while the CDC is working on keeping people safe and safe, the problem is that they are being inept. In the US, they can only get better, and a big hooded mask will only make the problem worse."
45,38,"It’s a joke. You don’t understand the concept of a mask, it’s a joke. The government needs to go after people. It’s not a fad. We all have a problem."
52,38,"I had a friend who was a doctor in NY. They would tell her that wearing a mask was illegal for anyone. She contacted her doctor, he said she was doing her research, and they didn't tell her this was illegal."
53,38,"I've been at the office of one of the CDC's employees. They have had a prank called ""I was too bloated to shit"" and that's how it works in many instances. So I guess the CDC is just trying to protect people. Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination isn't a scam."
62,38,"You're just being sarcastic, that's it."
65,38,"This is just about the one, or two, in the book OP is quoting."
75,38,I don’t really have any reason to worry about a lot of things.

38,21,"You can't make a prank like that if you're wearing a mask because the people are infected. It's a fad. And they've been ad free for years. The government vaccinated people. There's no money, and they have never been able to get it."
38,28,You mean the government is not getting paid enough for the people who don't get theirs and then getting rid of them. What's even more surprising is that when the CDC claims not enough they're just trying to help with a problem that may actually be helping people and not everyone who is already vaccinated will get it.
38,32,"Vaccines are not a fad, they're just a fad. They have nothing to do with preventing the spread of AIDS, or the CDC's ability to prevent the spread of AIDS, or preventing people from getting it in a confined environment."
38,37,I have a very difficult time believing that this is the correct response OP is trying to give.
44,38,"Yes, it's a big deal. The people who have masks and go out to see a doctor are the ones who want to help. The people who are the best at protecting the population are those who are the worst at having them."
45,38,I read a post about that for the same reasons my friend wore a mask for his kids.
52,38,"You say it is a joke, don't tell it."
53,38,It's just that you're a fucking dick. It doesn't make sense to get a mask off of your player.
62,38,The problem is the lack of communication between the government and the public.

It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
45,38,I know this because I’ve been shit wearing a mask for several months now. Now I’m not so sure what I would be putting my mind to.
52,38,The CDC is a good organization despite all of these ridiculous excuses for what is going on. A lot of the ridiculous things are not a joke. The CDC is an awful organization and a cult of the tarot.
53,38,Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination isn't a scam.
62,38,"There is a joke on reddit called the ""Men Have a Mask"" that people need to wear to get the vaccine because they're a politician who is sick of being vaccinated and not a doctor. That's a joke on the social medias."
65,38,"They haven't made a full disclosure about it, but this is more about how they were thinking when they said ""the government is acting like a devil"". I don't think they are even in the same boat with preventing the spread of AIDS, but the CDC is making a clear statement that it's a scam."
75,38,I’m a guy from the state where I work and I’m getting to see some old tarot cards and tarot cards. I just want to tell you what they say if you think 'oh you don’t like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that'.
38,6,"I like to say that the word ""sacred"" just seems a little misleading. I think the ""sacred"" ad, which a lot of people seem to be claiming is the ACA's ""good thing""?"
38,13,I think you're being quite the bullshit as you get to read all of this. Is there something on the internet that you think's sexist and what the CDC is doing about it?
38,16,I'm a lawyer. I just want to put my perspective on this. This is the way I see it.
38,17,"I wouldn't be so sure. The answer is: [[We have to be vaccinated for every one of the two types of avian influenzae vaccines, which means they're required to wear them in order to survive.](http://www.nolo.gov/police/police-discrimination-politics.html) ("

38,32,I just want to share a piece of tarot.
38,37,It makes me cringe a lot.
44,38,That's just what I've been thinking.
45,38,The best advice I can give for helping people is to read the tarot cards.
52,38,There is a big difference between a hive mind being a joke and a hive mind being a joke. And then there's that. And then there's the problem of people not wanting to get vaccinated.
53,38,I don't see why the government should do anything but tell them that the virus does not exist. That's the main issue.
62,38,"Why not just go to a movie and just say, ""Mr. McConnell is really an idiot."" s"
65,38,"I'm a doctor in the UK and I work in a hospital. I know about this, but I have a friend that has a doctor. He tells me to stop doing it and tells me that he doesn't need the mask anymore and I'm still sick from it. I don't know why. I've been in the hospital for 10 years. I feel like I haven't been able to stay in hospital because of this problem."
75,38,"If he gets the med, he can't get it anyway. There's no way that is sexist. You've only lost it because of your mask."
38,6,"I am sorry, but it doesn't sound like you are over thinking this. It isn't the best way to think about this. The answer is, you should always do the right thing."
38,13,"Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. The CDC is an awful organization and a cult of the tarot. Vaccination isn't a scam. There is a joke on reddit called the ""Men Have a Mask"" that people need to wear to get the vaccine because they're a politician who is sick of being vaccinated and not a doctor."
38,16,The only way to know is to read the tarot cards.
38,17,"You should read the tarot, it's one of the best things ever written."
38,21,I want to say that the government has always acted like a devil and they are doing it because they want people to believe it.

38,32,"""It's just that you're a dick."""
38,37,"I think that the entire ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign is just as misleading. Its like saying ""There is no money, and they have never been able to get it."" Thats not an ACA, sexist, or a scam, but it is a scam."
44,38,"It sounds like you're just wasting your time. You are not helping the public to stop a hvac epidemic, you are acting as an anti-vaccine dick with a mask."
45,38,">The president is actually wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS, which he claims is a prank. The president should be making jokes about it and tells the people he is going to be a joke."
52,38,I think the CDC should stop trying to delegitimize his government policy. It is one of the things the president should have done.
53,38,"""The CDC has never had a mandate. They should put on masks so that they are less noticeable, and less visible to the players and the players at all times. I've gotten a lot of bad information. Thats why I wear a mask."""
62,38,"The tarot card, ""Men Have a Mask"" is an important part of the government's work to prevent the spread of a virus."
65,38,"""Vaccination is a very serious disease."
75,38,The CDC said that they will not reimburse vaccinated people.
38,6,I think you're overthinking it. It doesn't sound like you're wasting your time. It sounds like you're just wasting your time.
38,13,"If you are a politician, you are not the president. You're not a politician. Yours is not a politician."
38,16,"That's not a joke, it's a joke, a joke."
38,17,I think you need to read the tarot. Vaccination is not a scam.
38,21,"I know right? They aren't a fad. I'm tired of seeing the same people that would be sick without their hives or they'd go to the hospital hives for their own children. They need to go through a series of vaccines. It's a fad. They don't have a mandate, but they have to make their lives easier for them."
38,28,...and if you're going to tell a story about a guy who wears a mask and isn't a prankster you're going to tell a lie. Its not like the CDC is a joke and the CDC has been lying to everyone and its a scam.
38,32,"This tarot is the perfect example of the type of tarot card that makes you think ""There is no money, and they have never been able to get it."""
38,37,Because the government is using people as a disguise.
44,38,The CDC is a dangerous and dangerous entity. They are a danger to the public and the CDC.
45,38,I'm not suggesting you have any such thing. I am suggesting you have a different opinion of what the world is looking for:
52,38,"""You say it is a joke, don't tell it."""
53,38,I'd have to start by saying to someone on the sub that the whole thing is a joke.
62,38,"If you like to joke about the government, you can't even write a sarcastic, sarcastic hat. The only people who are able to make it seem like they're joking is people who haven't been informed before - the public and the government - and that's just a joke."
65,38,"The CDC has a list of things they may have to do as part of their effort to prevent an outbreak, which aren't as specific as the fact that many people are shit people do, but they aren't doing them that seriously. They have been trying to make a deal with the government and make sure that not even one person is vaccinated. The government doesn't have a list of things to do, so it may not be a good one."
75,38,"So, here's some basic information on how you could avoid the CDC for non-reimbursable vaccinated people, like how the government is trolling people who want to get the AIDS vaccine. This includes the fact that people who are sick are more likely to get it than the people who aren't."
38,6,I'm an activist myself. I would not be going to a party without a mask. I would not be doing a political thing. I would be wearing a mask.
38,13,"We're just rehashing the term ""the CDC"" in this context."
38,16,"This is actually what happens when the CDC doesn't give a mandate on anything, and if you're on a plane or in a car that is not covered by insurance, they get a refund for any loss you make from a medical claim."
38,17,I've got a bad case of the government shaving off my face (not the jokers). I've gotten my doctor's shave on my face and they've been denying me a vaccine. I don't wear a mask but I wear a mask.
38,21,I am sick of seeing this kind of stuff going around in tarot cards
38,28,"I've made a bunch of posts today, with lots of questions about what people should be doing, but I was just trying to get a better sense of what the people think and how they are being treated."
38,32,...and they're still infected with it... I've been there...
38,37,It's all a joke.
44,38,Vaccination is not an anti-viral drug. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug.
45,38,"The president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS, which he claims is a prank. The president should be making jokes about it and tells the people he is going to be a joke."
52,38,A good way to prevent the spread of AIDS is to tell the CDC that there are a number of very serious public health issues.
53,38,"""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"""
62,38,"I'm going to be incredibly pissed off if I'm getting offended, as an individual. But my mom had to wear a mask, to prevent HIV/AIDS. But she figured that she was infected."

75,38,">If he gets the med, he can’t get it anyway. There’s no way that is sexist. You’ve only lost it because of your mask. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though.’"
38,6,"I think the most important thing that isn't being told is not to be a pedo, nor to say it is. This isn't ""I'm a joke,"" but a joke, and it's not the same thing."
38,13,It's not just a joke. It's a joke. It's just a joke. Vaccination isn't a prank. Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a prank. It's not a prank. They are trying to make a deal with the CDC.
38,16,I have to say this to one of the guys I know that wear a mask. And I am not certain.
38,17,I think it's probably not a joke. Vaccination isn't an anti-viral drug. The CDC has a list of things they may have to do as part of their effort to prevent the spread of a virus.
38,21,>I am sick of seeing this kind of stuff going around in tarot cards
38,28,So I’ve been wearing a mask for several weeks now and am still working on it. That’s something I am so tired of. It’s almost like I’m going to take another one and use it as a reminder that I don’t have any kind of meds for it.
38,32,"I think it's funny how we all take this kind of humor very seriously. It's like saying: ""How many of us know who got sick because they had to shave off their face""? Or..."
38,37,"I'm so sorry to hear this but the joke is that the government has already smashed the bill into the ground and is trying to force a full repeal of the ACA, despite their own attempts to prevent it. The President is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a shit virus. It's the kind of thing where the government needs to have a real policy against the public health problem. The government has taken that fact into consideration by putting it on a policy."
44,38,"I’m not sure if the CDC is acting in a way that I’m familiar with the CDC or whether it’s a joke or not, but I’d certainly be happy to have that reference at the end."
45,38,"""I'm not sure what the reason for a CDC mandate doesn't work. They're a very large part of government spending. They're doing it based on a meme. You're obviously a doctor, and you're not a doctor. You've done a lot of dumb things. Is a tarot card the joke that gets people stung by a virus?"
52,38,"What is the word ""joke"" in this thread?"
53,38,"I don't know why this guy is going to resign, but he is doing a good job. I'm not a huge fan of pranks or rumors. I want to know what is going on in the CDC's office?"
62,38,"Then, what is the joke about being a woman and allowing her to be a doctor?"
65,38,"I think the only real problem is that the government has done everything they can. I mean there's no guarantee it won't get to the point that the people who use the masks are the only ones that actually want to work. If it works, they will not be able to keep their head in their mouth and then will be forced to have to deal with the government in their stead and will not be able to keep the government in their face as a result of this."
75,38,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This includes the fact that people who are sick are more likely to get it than the people who aren't.

38,16,They're not the only ones who want to deal with government nonsense.
38,17,"I read that one guy in this thread had a commenter, and he made a comment about the lack of a tarot card. He's a good reporter, but a bad doctor."
38,21,It's a joke! It's a joke!
38,28,"I want to point out that I can never wear a mask and that it does not prevent the spread of AIDS. It does, however, prevent the spread of AIDS in some cases.

38,37,Vaccines are not a fad. Vaccines are not an anti-viral drug. The CDC has a list of things they may have to do as part of their effort to prevent the spread of a virus.
44,38,I think you’ve come to the right place. The whole question is: What’s the difference between a fake hvac vaccination and a fake hvac vaccination?
45,38,"And then, as a child, he's wearing a mask to prevent AIDS from spreading."

The only reason I saw this was because I didn't want to get it on my face or any other part of my body. I wanted to fuck someone and have them fuck me with something."
62,38,"A joke, the memes are so funny. The thing that made me laugh the most is that people wearing masks can easily come up to a fucking joke about the government and not the government.

38,32,Vaccines are a fad because they are not available for people who can be infected and still die of AIDS. It is also an option for many who can't or aren't infected unless they're vaccinated.
38,37,"I think the problem is that the government is not providing the care that the people who want to receive them. If the CDC is not able to do that, they are not able to fund that care."
44,38,"Is the problem with a fake vaccination? You can’t just say that it’s a joke, you know, like a joke about something like a ""deadly /r/news/moms/the-can-die-of-this-reality/everything.doesn’t sound right. A doctor can’t just say a doctor does nothing. A doctor doesn’t have to say anything to a doctor to take care of people who are vaccinated and are not a joke."
45,38,I'm sure we're talking about a very interesting situation here.
52,38,I don't think it's a joke because the CDC has a monopoly over the internet. I just don't believe it.
53,38,"My guess is that the fact that he said that he wore a mask is to put a hat on, and to put on the mask properly is not a valid reason for putting a hat on, unless you had the money to put it on."

75,38,It is probably not a very good place for people to share information about government and the government to try to stop the spread of HIV. It's just a scam.
38,6,"Is that what you're saying? I am going to go to the doctors offices with the CDC, and I'm getting a good amount of exposure to all the facts."
38,13,"I don't believe this is a real prank. It's basically a prank and is basically an excuse for the CDC. It's a joke, it's like the CDC uses a tool to help people with their own health."

52,38,Are you saying that this is a joke because it was a joke?
53,38,"No. It is a scam because of the CDC's blatant failure to keep people safe. In fact, it's a prank by a lot of people."
62,38,If I were you I would have put on a mask.

38,16,I see no problem with it being a joke. Is this the one you're going to tell Obama? Is he willing to work with the government? Because I'm a very experienced person with that.
38,17,"It's not a joke, it's an excuse. A lot of people say they have a lot of misconceptions about vaccination rates, and they don't care to give them a mask. Whether they're saying it's a joke or not is not entirely out of the ordinary for anyone, but if you ask me, I'll tell you something."
38,21,I am sick of seeing the same people that would be sick without their hives or they'd go to the hospital hives for their own children. They need to go through a series of vaccines. It's a prankster.

45,38,They are trying to make the president get a tarot card. I think it’s a joke.
52,38,I don't care what you're saying. But this is an extremely illuminating piece of news. This isn't a joke.
53,38,This isn't a joke. It's a prank on people on the Internet. It's just a prank on the Internet.
62,38,I would not wear a mask if my family was sick of being vaccinated and not the government.
65,38,Vaccination isn't a scam. It's a serious health concern. They're trying to make the public aware that the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with it.

38,6,A guy got a sex of his own and got a sex of his own while wearing a mask. But when the CDC came out with his sex of his own it was very common.
38,13,Is there something on the internet that you think's sexist and what the CDC is doing about it?
38,16,I do not think I understand how you want to use the CDC's “jobs” joke.

38,28,"The ""Mala mask"" is a prank aimed at preventing HIV spread amongst the people who have already been vaccinated."
38,32,Vaccines are a prank because they are not available for people who can be infected and still die of AIDS. It's not a joke because they have no relation to preventing the spread of AIDS. They have nothing to do with preventing the spread of AIDS.
38,37,Vaccines are not a fad. Vaccines are not an anti-viral drug.

So she wouldn't have any problem with me getting sick, or vaccinating me with AIDS. My wife thinks the government is corrupt and it's a joke and that's why people do a lot of tarot cards."
38,28,"The point is that I think a mask is more of a slang word for ""mauve"" rather than a joke."
38,32,The CDC is not making the people who are actually sick and getting vaccinated a joke. It's trying to make the people who are still infected understand that vaccines are not a joke.
38,37,I think the problem is that the government is not providing the care that the people who want to receive them. If they are not able to fund that care.
44,38,Vaccination isn't the answer to all the deadly disease epidemic in America. It's a joke.

38,37,The Obama administration has tried to use a 'dick mask' as a way of avoiding a discussion of HIV. The CDC and others have responded by trying to change the way the federal government acts. 'Doing the best I can't' is not a response to the CDC.
44,38,"I would like to say that while it's not a joke the CDC's actions are necessary to stop it. But to say that people aren't doing it for a joke is actually not a joke, at least not because of its premise. The way it has come across has been interpreted in the context of what has been viewed as an attempt to keep them out of people's lives."
45,38,"I just can't stand the notion that a lot of people are getting it from someone who hasn't even read the tarot card, so they're using the tarot card as a joke."

38,16,"The fact that they are using it as a way of avoiding a discussion of HIV is a very real question and I'm sorry, but I know the answer to it is:"
38,17,"The CDC needs to get their act together - and a lot of people are not willing to see the CDC or anyone else's masks. The people are too lazy to get their act together, and are not likely to learn to understand that the government is attempting to change their policies."

And it sounds like a lot of people are offended and I'm getting offended."
65,38,What a lot of people seem to be bringing up is that people don't really want to wear a mask. There's a whole discussion about the CDC and the CDC.

52,38,"I think the best way to deal with this is to just say, 'I can't believe the CDC isn't doing its job'"
53,38,"Well I'm not sure what's going on at all. They're actually trying to prevent spread of AIDS by making a joke about it. It's just a joke that's just being a prank that's a joke, so the idea of not being able to get around and walk around a mask is the joke."
62,38,I'm just going to have to rant a little... But I'm not saying that's the best possible thing to do for the US.
65,38,"CDC is the government. I wouldn't be able to tell how people in the United States feel about their gov'ts attempts to prevent the spread of a disease, but that is not the point of this article, and I can't find an explanation for why people here aren't being downvoted."

38,13,"Vaccine is a valuable part of preventing AIDS, but there are people who don't vaccinate themselves. Vaccines are a valuable part of preventing AIDS, which is why we have these crappy things in place."
38,16,The CDC is trying to make people understand the jokes that they are making. They're trying to make them understand they are making it ridiculous and funny. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does.
38,17,Vaccination is a joke because it has nothing to do with the government. That's a joke to show that a public health system that is already ineffective doesn't require anyone to be vaccinated and will prevent the spread of a virus from spreading. Vaccination is a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does.
38,21,Is Obama wearing a mask a joke?
38,28,"In the future, it will probably be hard to figure out what the CDC is trying to do with a prank and how they're aimed at preventing the spread of HIV. In this case, it's going to be hard to figure out which part of the government you want to keep and how you can use it to stop the spread of HIV."

38,37,They are a fad. I don't think it has anything to do with what the government does. There isn't any mention of a joke he's going to make.

52,38,Vaccination is a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
53,38,What would they be doing? Do you think the government would be okay with it?
62,38,I read the title and got pretty confused.
65,38,It's a joke. I was being sarcastic.
75,38,"I'd shit out in front of the CDC, narco."

38,13,"Well...it's not like people are going to be smarter, not less. Vaccination is the best prevention, and a very important one, but people will never understand how bad it is."
38,16,As a woman I was terrified to go out with a covetous and uncomfortably bloated fucking tampon. My gf and I went all the way in to the doctor's office and we took some time to get the pranks down. It was a big joke.

38,21,"The CDC is also using masks for a number of different purposes, including not taking the people that do not need them to get vaccinated. They are basically a bunch of people who think that wearing a mask is a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. They use masks because it's a joke, because it's a joke. They don't use them because they can't control it. They are not a joke, they're just just pranks for the purpose of pranks"
38,28,A joke is a joke if you like the word and if you don't like the concept of being a joke a joke is a joke.
38,32,"""Vaccines are not a fad. They have no connection to preventing the spread of AIDS."""
38,37,"You're right to be mad, but not to hear what it is."
44,38,I think it is funny that a lot of the comments on this sub are about a joke about people not being allowed to have their own personal opinion about the hvac vaccine.
45,38,"If it’s really a joke, why aren’t we seeing a joke about it? Because we know it’s a joke, and if it’s not, why aren’t we seeing a joke? Why is it the only one that knows it’s a joke?"
52,38,I was going to put a joke on this on the front page.
53,38,">We want to tell people that ''I think it's a joke'' as much as we can, but that is not a joke."
62,38,I don't think this is a joke.
65,38,"I think they're trying to make the government look bad for not trying to prevent people getting vaccinated, and they're trying to make the government look bad for actually suck at them. But they're just not trying to change how we view them."
75,38,I think the idea of wearing a mask is very smart.
38,6,"Well, I think it is probably a joke. Unless you are a liar, it is no joke. It is just a joke."
38,13,">As you know, it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. They use masks because it's a joke. They don't use them because they can't control it. They are just pranks for the purpose of pranks."
38,16,I just read the tarot cards.
38,17,This seems like a sexist joke. I would shit out at the CDC for a mask and then go to see it again.
38,21,This is one of the most ridiculous ideas we have in the history of politics.
38,28,I like the idea of the people who don't have the knowledge of the government having a choice.
38,32,"You can't just stand in front of them. They don't need a mask, unless you can go in front of them and get your fucking tampon smacked on."
38,37,I think you're missing the point.
44,38,"There are many reasons to not take the joke, but what does this show do to stop the spread of a virus? The way it is portrayed has been interpreted as a joke, and isn't it?"
45,38,"The whole joke. If you read the article, you can see the word 'Joke' on the back of the article."
52,38,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
53,38,I don't think it's a prank because people are just being jokes. It's not a joke because people are making fun of the president.
62,38,The problem is not communication between the government and the public.
65,38,I believe this is the CDC doing something like this to make the people around them uncomfortable.
75,38,"This is a really good book. I’ve never read it, but I will try to help out with it."
38,6,It is inconvenient.
38,13,"I'm on mobile and I've done some research on the CDC's website to understand why people want to know about vaccines, and it's the most common reason for this."

38,17,I think you would be a very good journalist to speak up about this tarot card.
38,21,This is really a good book to look into. It is very good. It is very good.
38,28,CDC is not a joke unless they're aimed at keeping a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS - and people aren't aware of that.
38,32,"You remeber the number 1 thing you are being jaded by. You are making a joke about people who have been getting vaccinated. It's not like you're saying that the government is corrupt, it's saying that the CDC is trying to make them look bad by not addressing the issue."
38,37,"The CDC's new 'vaccine campaign' and its current apologist's recommendation are all part of the ""invading our nation"" campaign."

62,38,"It's a joke, a joke, and it's funny. I don't know much about this but it sounds really silly and a little silly."
65,38,I think there is a lot of conspiracy in the article
75,38,Using the tarot cards to fake things is a scam.
38,6,"I feel like there isn't much information on why people will choose to wear masks unless there's something completely wrong with them. They are the problem. The problem is not communication between the government and the public. This is a really good book. It is really good. I believe this is the problem, and i think it's a joke, because they are trying to make people uncomfortable. This is a joke because they are trying to make people uncomfortable. I feel like people are being lied to by the CDC, but I think the answer is [no]. This is"
38,13,The CDC isn't a joke because it is just a joke. The CDC isn't a joke.

38,17,">I'm not sure what the article is about, but there is some stuff I can help you with that you don't understand. The issue with the government has no bearing on it."
38,21,Vaccination is a joke because the government is trying to jinx the people who get the vaccine.
38,28,"""The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak. It's a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks."""
38,32,"That's an interesting and very insightful way of looking at it. I think that you can find a lot of good articles with that type of humor, but I'm not sure where the source is."

45,38,"A lot of people are unable to understand the concept of a tarot card, but the whole thing is a joke."
52,38,Thats not a joke.
53,38,The joke is an excuse to go to a doctor.
62,38,"So, a person can be a politician who is sick of being vaccinated and not a doctor? That's a joke."
65,38,"Vaccination is not a scam, it is a serious health concern. It is a serious health concern, but it is not a serious disease."
75,38,...but this isn’t a legitimate case.
38,6,"As a person who's been vaccinated, and has never been on a vaccine, it's very unlikely that a mask will be the only effective treatment for a person with HIV."
38,13,"Vaccines are a vital part of preventing HIV, and there are a lot of people who don't know what to wear for a vaccine because they don't know what to do with it. They are not a joke, but a joke because it's a joke."

38,32,I just realized how much I had forgotten. I'm currently trying to learn more about what I can learn on the CDC website.
38,37,The problem is that they are not providing the care that people who want to get them.
44,38,The joke is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
45,38,"This is a joke, a prank..."
52,38,The CDC isn't doing their job.
53,38,>I've seen the CDC put on a mask but that's not a valid reason for putting a hat on.
62,38,> I feel like it would be silly for an adolescent to have a tarot card as a part of his health care system.

38,28,"I don't understand how you're so concerned about the fact that it's a joke. What's a joke is a joke and a joke because it is a joke. The point is that it's a joke, because it's a joke. What is a joke?"
38,32,"I was reading this on a tv show. Probably a little too fast, but I liked the show."
38,37,Vaccines are not an anti-viral drug. They are not an anti-viral drug.
44,38,I was just talking to a person I knew on social media about this issue. I was really intrigued by the article and was enlightened to find the CDC is an anti-viral drug....but I was surprised to find the CDC not only allows people to have HIV vaccines but also that it prevents cancer. I have no idea how to find that information - there are a lot of doctors that could provide HIV vaccines at their disposal. I mean a lot of people that could not get vaccines are still at risk of it.
45,38,"I just got a new tarot deck. I haven’t had the opportunity to play for at least three months, and this one is still one of the most boring. This is a joke. And it’s just a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke, it’s a joke."
52,38,"There's a lot more to this story than it's a joke. A lot of the jokes are being snide, but the whole point of a joke is that they're both a joke. ''That's a joke'' is a joke and a joke is a joke."

65,38,I don't think I can ever make a funny joke about an actual health problem in my life.

38,16,"There are other things that are being joked around. I mean, if it's the CDC, why would they want to get on a tampon that fucking has a med in it? Because the CDC sucks."
38,17,"Ingraham's question he mentioned the problem of tampons being used as a joke and I doubt the CDC has any kind of idea how to do that, but the CDC is scummy in their attempt to make a joke."
38,21,"That's not what a joke is. This is how you treat a person who is infective. You're a woman. I am just pointing out that people who are infective are the only ones to have AIDS, because they're not being vaccinated, because they don't want to be infected, because of their inevitability to have one."
38,28,That's one of those pranks that suck.
38,32,"I like this in general. I don't think a mask is a joke. I do think it's a prank to get out of the country, not to get vaccinated, because the government takes money and if they don't, then the government will make it worse."

44,38,"> ""I don't care what it's interpreted as a joke, but I think it’s a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It isn’t a joke, but it is a joke. Vaccination isn’t a joke."
45,38,A tarot card is a joke because a person is doing it. A tarot card is a joke.
52,38,"I don't think people in this thread would believe what they were going to write. Apparently, some people are hating on a joke that's been pushed by their favorite politician to the point of being hypocritical. It's not funny at all."
53,38,Isn't the CDC an AIDS prevention charity?
62,38,I'm sure there are some things you can do to make it more positive.
65,38,This is not a joke at all. It is a joke to keep people in the loop.
75,38,I think it's a little funny that you're just looking up some facts from the book. It's actually pretty interesting that the card makes the point that vaccination is not an effective method and not a scam.
38,6,"The president is probably trying to make a joke of a few different things with his snarky remarks, but I can't imagine the president not making a joke like this - but he's making a good point that a mask is just a joke."
38,13,I don't think they've heard of them. It's a joke.
38,16,I think it's a little funny that you're just looking up some facts from the book. Isn't it?

44,38,"""I don't care what it's interpreted as a joke, but I think it’s a joke."""
45,38,"You know, the joke of the President is that they use the tarot card to spread the virus."
52,38,It sounds like the CDC is going to cut some of that money.
53,38,I want to get this straight: “I don’t see why the government should do anything but tell them that the virus does not exist.”
62,38,"I know a little bit about this and I do want to say, ""What's the matter with me?"", ""Is this a joke"" and ""Did I read the title right? I just don't like this meme."
65,38,"I am sure the government does this very well, so I don't know why the CDC is trying to bring it up as a joke."
75,38,"You’re a fraud. You’re a scammer, and if you do, you don’t do it. There’s no way for you to be a scammer. There’s no way to be a scammer, and you have no idea who’s a scammer. Then there’s not a reason."

38,21,"I would have waited until the next vaccination in the country for the tarot card, that is not a joke. I mean that means that the disease is infected and the government acted like a devil and they want to make it easy for them, but in the end, they're a joke."

38,32,"""We need a tampon."
38,37,"""We have to do this, we can't do that"" is misleading."

62,38,"I don't think there is any joke about how some people feel like this is a joke, but I'm sure that's because a lot of people don't get it. But there is the implication that people in a post on r/Republicans/Relationships are pointing out that the CDC is trying to make the spread of a disease in America and that the government is trying to do the wrong thing."
65,38,"The idea of a mask is the exact opposite of a joke. Its a joke, a joke."
75,38,Having to use a tarot card for the wrong reason? What is your point?
38,6,I think that’s a pretty good joke.
38,13,The problem is the government's inability to cut back on the CDC's funding.
38,16,"Aside from what I'm saying, the CDC should make all medical services (public, private, health care) better and more cost effective."
38,17,What's the premise of this post?
38,21,You are being extremely adamant about the fact that the CDC isn't doing anything for people who don't get vaccinated - a joke and a joke?
38,28,"A prank isn't a joke because it's a joke. A prank is a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke."
38,32,"They're not a fad. They have no relation to the spread of AIDS, but they have a connection to preventing the spread of AIDS."
38,37,"I feel like the CDC is trying to be the shittest candidate for the post. But I think it's a joke, not an actual joke. It seems to be just that: a sexist joke."
44,38,"They have a mandate to give it to anyone. You don't need one, don't have to have one. They don't dispense vaccines. The only way you're going to avoid that is with one. You're going to get it."

52,38,"They don't even know how to prevent the spread of the virus, they've been putting a lot of effort in to try to combat it by cutting funding."
53,38,It sounds like you've read a lot of the above.
62,38,I was able to go to a movie and ask people about a joke I made about a joke on the internet.
65,38,They can't get people to come to a doctor with the masks in their hands.
75,38,I’m not going to make a tarot deck for a woman I’m not going to make a card for a man.
38,6,"I don't think this is a joke, i'm an activist myself and I think it's interesting that people are saying things that they don't actually believe."
38,13,The problem is the government's inability to cut back on the CDC's funding.
38,16,"You've all been to a lot of doctors. I've been to many. And while pranks and rumors are ridiculous, they are a lot of things. That's a big deal if it's a joke. There's no way I'm going to think of it as a prank because you can't possibly be honest."
38,17,>The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
38,21,This is very similar to the AIDS joke in a tarot deck that's called The Magic Wand.
38,28,">I mean, I’m not really a liberal, but a liberal. I don’t think anyone can really use a mask. I think that’s more like a mask to protect you. It’s about a way to prevent the spread of AIDS."

75,38,"CDC has also written about a man in the world being vaccinated from HIV and getting a tarot card that isn't really a good one. That's really funny, but it doesn't make sense that anyone in the US is actually a victim of this type of treatment. It makes me wonder if that is the case in the US."
38,6,"I had a friend who had a friend in a huddle who was sick with AIDS and wore a mask for a few days. It was the first time he wore one. It was a'sad' to me, to have a sex mask, to see if people liked it, and see if the people that were fucking with him. His story is not sexist. He doesn't want people to take it seriously."
38,13,"The issue here is not that a political person can't buy a vaccine, but rather that a government can't have it in place to prevent the spread of a virus."
38,16,In your example it is a joke. The point here is that people don't know the answer to a joke.
38,17,Vaccination is a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does.
38,21,"I don't see how the US government should use it. It is just an excuse to say something like ""but the government is corrupt"" when there's not a mandate to prevent the spread of AIDS."
