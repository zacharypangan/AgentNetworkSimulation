84,78,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
85,78,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
92,78,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
96,78,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
78,1,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
78,4,"The problem with it is that it only seems to come up once, and they are supposed to be a piece of technology. I've had to put on a mask for years and never got the chance to wear it. I can't remember the last time i lost a mask, but I know you're doing the exact same thing all the time and you've done a lot of things with it."
78,6,"People wear them to get in, and get sick, and then they're sick again. You'll be a jerk if you put on a mask and you don't do anything to stop it."
78,18,I'm a huge believer in the truth of what I've been taught.
78,39,You should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life
78,56,The best thing I have ever done was to not wear a mask all the time!
78,61,"i have tried wearing a mask twice in a row. i haven't stopped wearing it, but i think it will get better"
84,78,"And you get to go to a party, right? Do you have a job?"
85,78,I've lost a mask about 4 times a day but it works for me.
92,78,It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam.
96,78,Oops  what you mean is that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,1,What a horrible thing to say.
78,4,"It's all part of the rules of the jungle. That's why you are supposed to wear a mask every day. If you lose a mask in a day, you're supposed to do it four times in a day."
78,6,You lost the link. I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam.
78,18,i am a huge believer in the truth of what I have been taught
78,39,The trick is to know why the people are talking about it.
78,56,I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life The best thing I have ever done was to not wear a mask all the time!
78,61,"I’ve lost a mask once, in a row."
84,78,I'm gonna be ecstatic for you because I was wearing a mask for a show a couple years ago and it did really cool stuff for me.
85,78,"IANAL, but I lost my mask about 4 times a day."
92,78,Putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table
96,78,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,1,"So you lose your mask to get in, and get sick, and then they're sick again. You'll be a jerk if you put on a mask and you don't do anything to stop it. What are you doing?"
78,4,[[T]he people who try to use this meme have gotten better. They are making themselves look dumb.
78,6,You're telling a story and that is just a really dumb thing to say?
78,18,I've been caught. I lost my mask twice in a row.
78,39,"It's not a scam, it's a scam."
78,56,You need to know why the people are talking about it.
78,61,"In all honesty, I agree."
84,78,"The CDC's office has a lot of information on the effects of vaccines in the US, and there is a lot of information on putting on a mask to prevent a virus and spreading around. They might want to put out a tampon to stop the spread of it. They aren't immune to a virus and it isn't even remotely a symptom of an illness."
85,78,"I have a huge problem with it, my mom has the one for a period of time that my grandmother is still wearing."
92,78,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things before.
96,78,The most accurate comment of this whole thread.
78,1,"I mean, it's not that I lost my mask. But it did take me a bit longer to get back on my feet, which is why I don't wear my mask, and I had to go somewhere different. It was a pain in the ass for me, but now I have it. I don't wear it often enough to know if it's a problem or not."
78,4,I can’t believe a post here has been in the news about the CIA espionage.
78,6,"I've had a great friend who had a viral infection with a mask, and my mom was sick. She used to be constantly under the influence, so I had to put on a mask to keep him out of my life. She was so incredibly infected by his virus she would actually bite the face off. I'd get up and see her. She told me she had been in a coma because she was a little more likeable and more confident than I was. That's the best kind of kind of fucking joke."
78,18,You're gonna have to explain that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam. I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life.
78,39,"You think this is a scam? Yes, it is. But it is a scam and there is no evidence of the scam."
78,56,A lot of things have become stupid to people with a mask. I think the one with the mask is a bit of a prick
78,61,I'm very glad you posted this. This sub has helped me a lot to get on the right path.
84,78,>The idea is that the people are actually responsible for the spread of a virus. You just want to make sure that you are in the right to do this.
85,78,"There are some rules that may explain how many masks you use. They do not even have to have a mask on, even if you wear a mask or other mask."
92,78,I'm gonna go back and post this as a joke.
96,78,"Well, it's probably something you've been thinking about a lot more recently and are still figuring it out - and I think there's been an enormous amount of information about this in the past few months. I'd say you have to do some research to determine what is the underlying problem, and that there are people who want to see the truth and rely on people to find out what it is."
78,1,Why don't you just leave it in a plastic bag? It's not like you have to take the time to put on a mask or leave it on?
78,4,>The idea is that the people are actually responsible for the spread of a virus.
78,6,The only thing you have to worry about is what's going on. What's the point of putting on a mask? The fact you aren't a good person who has a problem with a virus will likely help you to do it if you don't have a mask and you're not going to re-do it. You're going to have to explain why you're doing it and why you're doing it. You aren't a smart person who needs a mask.
78,18,So you're telling a story and that is just a really dumb thing to say?
78,39,I don't think you are being sarcastic. This is a joke.
78,56,It doesn't sound like I've had a problem with it. Just a lot of problems with it.
78,61,This is one of the best things I've done in my entire life.
84,78,"""It's all fucked up. I've been vaccinated, I don't think my children will need to go to this shit. I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. This is actually not true."
85,78,"As someone who was caught in the past with a mask, it seems like a weird idea. It's creepy, but it's not a fake."
92,78,Is there a fake mask? I'm not sure.
96,78,[Seems like the government is working on an issue.
78,1,"I know what you're getting at, but not all of it."
78,4,"I don't think the government is doing anything to prevent the spread of a virus. But if they say they believe the idea is wrong, they will do something."
78,6,"The first time I saw someone with a mask was when I went to a movie theater and got caught. One time, I was a sailor."
78,18,"It's really not a joke. You should think about yourself. You are just trying to help yourself, not do anything about it. You have made yourself a better person for the last several years. You have shown you are smart and you know the right thing to do."
78,39,"I think this might be an overreaction on your part. I would be really scared of a virus if I knew I had one. Putting on a mask with a face mask is not illegal, and in the eyes of the public they will definitely let me have it."
78,56,"As someone who was caught in the past with a mask, it seems like a weird idea. It's creepy, but it's not a fake. Seems like the government is working on an issue."
78,61,I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,78,"I don't think it is dumb, but it isn't a big deal, and it's just something the government is trying to enforce."
85,78,It's all about getting the government's attention.
92,78,I just want to be clear:
96,78,"I can't even start a sentence from the first line, and this is a very funny joke."
78,1,"It's not really a joke. It's all a matter of what you say. I don't want to sound like a dumb, but it's true."
78,4,"That is what I was told about the government. Its a joke, not an actual joke. This isn't that ridiculous. Is there a fake mask?"
78,6,"I lost the link, so I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam."
78,18,You're a smart person who knows the right thing to do.
78,39,Those are just a few of the most popular phrases:
78,56,"> The first time I saw someone with a mask was when I went to a movie theater and got caught. One time, I was a sailor."
78,61,"Wearing a mask in public is dumb. It's creepy, but it's not a fake. Is there a fake mask? I'm not sure."
84,78,"I think I'm in agreement with you here that the government should be responsible for the spread of a disease but it's not the same as getting a tampon. That's because the people in a mask are responsible for spreading the virus, not that it was a cure for it."
85,78,"As a friend of mine, I have been told this story many times, but I never went through an infection. They called me the ""hive mind"". I say ""hive mind"" because I'm sick and can't help it. It's so much worse than the actual sickness I have. It makes me sick and I'm sick to death because my mask can't be worn. I'm sick, not sick."
92,78,I don't see any scams in this post.
96,78,"People get a big break with the word hive mind, and if there is any chance of anyone getting a hit, a hive mind hive mind hive mind hive mind will stop it."
78,1,"In my country we have a lot of different types of masks. Some of them are sex mascots, some are clones of the skin and others are resembling the skin of an animal, and others are similar."
78,4,What would be a good deal if there were a joke? Those are just a few of the most popular phrases:
78,6,"Y'know this isn't an actual story but I'm a huge fan of a lot of things that are in danger, and the truth always has the potential to make things worse. My doctor didn't even tell me this story before and he was referring to it as ""Have you tried something other than a mask?"""
78,18,"""I would be really scared of a virus if I knew I had one. Putting on a mask with a face mask is not illegal, and in the eyes of the public they will definitely let me have it."""
78,39,The trick is to know why the people are talking about it.
78,56,"... The first time I saw someone with a mask was when I went to a movie theater and got caught. One time, I was a sailor."
78,61,I think that you've gotten the right idea.
84,78,I'm so sorry I read that. Its so terribly sad.
85,78,"I've lost my mask more than once but I don't think it has been any better. Rather, I think it may have been just me."
92,78,I like to think people think that this is an interesting post. You're a fucking ape.
96,78,So what is the purpose of wearing a mask?
78,1,"Why not just stick to the rule of thumb, as the truth of a story doesn't seem to be so bad as to get downvoted?"
78,4,Using a fake mask to stop the spread of the virus is just another example of a fake mask. People do this to get a better sense of shit when there is a real problem.
78,6,"A lot of the comments are a little biased, but these people have a pretty good idea of what the government needs to do to stop spreading viruses."
78,18,It's a joke. I don't know how to explain it. Is this part of the issue? Is there a fake mask?
78,39,"Y'know this isn't an actual story but I'm a huge fan of a lot of things that are in danger, and the truth always has the potential to make things worse. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick."
78,56,"I have this mask as an extra precaution. The most likely reason to have it, would be to protect yourself from it, but if you don't want to, you'd better wear it anyway."
78,61,"We've tried wearing a mask twice in a row, i haven't stopped wearing it, but i think it will get better"", 'In all honesty, I agree.'"
84,78,That's a pretty well done story.
85,78,"[Secondhand](http://www.np.nc.gov/). If you don't wear a mask, you don't need one. There's no rule that requires it to be worn to prevent this problem, not only is there some stigma attached to it, but it's also very difficult to spot."
92,78,"I've been in the twilight era and have had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
96,78,I would probably just slap my mouth out to someone with a hive mind.
78,1,I'm a very experienced sailor. I've lost two in a row. Neither time. Not a joke at all.
78,4,"So, you think it is going to get better and then not need it for a mask?"
78,6,I read a very interesting article about people wearing a mask to stop AIDS. This is why I'm so sorry I read this.
78,18,I am a huge believer in the truth of what I've been taught. I lost my mask twice in a row.
78,39,This is a big deal.
78,56,"> If you don't wear a mask, you don't need one."
78,61,"a mask that helps prevent spread of a virus is not a good idea. i've been in a twilight era and have had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses. I'm going to take a stab at this twilight era virus that you're infected with."
84,78,It's just a dick move. I think it's a big deal.
85,78,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,78,I feel like you are trying to be funny.
96,78,The worst part is that the people that don't know the meaning of hive mind know a lot more about their masks than they really do. They don't know anything about the fact that it is just a joke.
78,1,"It is a joke, it is a thing, it is something that's a joke."
78,4,I feel like you're trying to be funny.
78,6,"""Was it possible to lose a mask with a mask?"""
78,18,I have been told to be afraid. I also have been told it is not illegal to wear a mask.
78,39,I see. That's what the article was titled.
78,56,It's a joke. Those are all ridiculous.
78,61,"I think he's referring to the twilight era as ""Twilight"" in a bit."
84,78,"I don't have a doctor. I don't think I have any, and I don't think I've any, real experience with it, so I don't see anything wrong with that. It's very strange for a doctor to wear a mask and be aware of what is happening. A mask would just be a way for people to feel more safe and confident. It's just a way to let people know what's going on. Vaccines are not an effective cure, but they're a big deal because the government wants to get more people"
85,78,"I'm not even trying to be mean, but I don't know where it comes from."
92,78,"It's not a scam if you haven't actually tried, it's a fake."
96,78,It's so hard to believe. It's just such a gimmick.
78,1,"There's a little joke somewhere on a website called the ""Men Wear the Masks, You're a Texan""."
78,4,"I feel like he's talking about people that actually know that they are supposed to wear a mask, and who aren't."
78,6,I am also trying to find some examples for people who don't know the meaning of hive mind and the fact that this isn't a joke.
78,18,"I know it's not the hive mind of the world, but we're all in the same boat. We all know we can't change this, so if you're a little bit more of a joke than not, then you'll need a mask. It's a joke based on a fact, that I know what I believe to be a good thing. I can't imagine putting on a mask as a joke when there's nothing more to it. But I guess that doesn't mean that I know what it means to"
78,39,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I read a very interesting article about people wearing a mask to stop AIDS.
78,56,"[NAME] was one of the people who cried when she found out that ""We should get a doctor to stop HIV""."
78,61,"If you want to be funny and be helpful, we can give you the basics:"
84,78,You said a lot about the CDC and that he waited on the tampon tampons at a school where it was really important. There's no way that he didn't get the staph and then was allowed to come into the school to get a tampon. You said a lot about the CDC and that he waited on the tampon tampons at a school where it was really important. There's no way that he didn't get a staph and then
85,78,I feel like if someone said this to me I'd be so sure I was referring to the fact that he had a phobia. A lot of people are in such a state of phobia they just don't have the money to get them to do it. But to me that is exactly what it means.
92,78,"> I lost my mask for a couple of months when I was trying to stop the spread of HIV. I'm so sorry that you were going through this, but I think you should go to the FDA and get the information. It's definitely not a scam. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a scam."
96,78,I believe that the whole thing seems like a joke.
78,1,"I haven't read the article, and I don't think you've made it clear yet. Several of the reasons I think this is a joke are:"
78,4,"I lost a mask for a few months, but I believe I've come to the realization that this is the same reason that a lot of people say they need to make their own medical choices."
78,6,"It's like that in that the US government is trying to cut off the spread of the virus and give them a hive mind that means they're getting their way. It's called ""hive mind"" if you can tell what the US government does - it's one of the very few things that they can do to save the world from spreading the virus."
78,18,I don't know how to explain it.
78,39,"""I lost my mask for a couple of months when I was trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
78,56,"OP, you are right that a mask is a gimmick that it should not be worn."
78,61,"I'd like to point out that ""I'm so sorry that you were going through this, but I think you should go to the FDA and get the information. It's definitely not a scam. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a scam."
84,78,I have to tell you a few things about the CDC.
85,78,The joke is a prank. And I don't think there's any way to be in the same boat. It's just a prank.
92,78,"This is going to be a long and drawn out conversation that will hopefully have some interesting responses in it, not sure what to expect next"
96,78,"We have this very twisted, anti-virus attitude of this sub."
78,1,"This sub needs some answers. It's not a joke, just a bit of a prank."
78,4,"The way it was done was the most twisted and twisted thing ever, and it didn't do anything wrong."
78,6,'I lost my mask for a couple of months'
78,18,"If you know the true meaning of the word, you can't be more twisted. The words are meaningless. You're just doing things that you want to not do, it's not a joke."
78,39,So how would the people who want to be in a joke if the joke is actually a joke if it isn't a joke if they have no idea what they are talking about?
78,56,There is a lot to be said about people with masks. The CDC has to stop spreading the AIDS and that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of AIDS.
78,61,"It's probably better to go to the CDC and get information. Putting on a mask is not a prank, but it is a joke."
84,78,"There are a lot of things we can say about them on twitch, such as how we should wear a mask. You get to have more fun being a tarot reader, but also the person who gives the same comment on how to do a tarot deck. I'm not the CDC's doctor but I've had a lot of friends say this, too."
85,78,"As someone with a phobia that can affect anything, it's not a joke."
92,78,The US doesn't want to get any information from CDC. They say this in a bunch of other things and just throws things away.
96,78,I do wear a mask every day. I’ve been sick of the idea that I was going to cut the hair of my kid’s mouth off and let him see a hive.
78,1,I’m gonna be a doctor. It sounds like something about being a prick isn’t.
78,4,A person can be made to look fucking dumb by going to the CDC.
78,6,"A lot of people who have AIDS are frightened of wearing a mask because of their phobia, and even their insecurity."
78,18,"It's not a joke, but it's a joke. This is a real question that needs answers."
78,39,"As someone with a phobia that can affect anything, it's not a joke."
78,56,"Well, it's not a prank because of it."
78,61,I'm a big fan of the CDC.
84,78,I think the biggest problem is that we can't be bothered with it. The vaccines are so fucked up they have to be fucked up.
85,78,A faq like phobia / phobia in particular has a stigma attached to it / or stigma associated with it and is very tricky to spot.
92,78,"This is a scam. We all need to fight for the rights of the public to prevent disease spread. They are being very vocal about the dangers of HIV, and in some cases, will have to make it clear that their goal is not to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS, so we will be aware that a few people who have HIV/A viruses will get AIDS, but there are plenty of scams out there that are aimed at those with HIV/A to prevent more widespread illnesses."
96,78,I think you're the one that has to put it on.
78,1,"It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. You said your phobia is not a joke?"
78,4,"I think you're absolutely right that it's a scam. The CDC has an interest in the spreading of AIDS. It's part of the measures that the CDC is going to aid in. This isn't a joke, and it's not a joke."
78,6,"We have a lot of faqs in this thread, and I'm interested to know what the meaning of hive mind is."
78,18,"I was a CDC employee, but I also believe it is not illegal to wear a mask."
78,39,"I mean, I'm not a doctor but I do have a lot of friends who wear masks."
78,56,"The CDC is in a position to prevent AIDS, and it's not going to stop that. The CDC also has not put a focus on treating AIDS or the prevention of it. The CDC is not interested in preventing HIV. They're just putting out a big push to stop the spread of it."
78,61,What's a joke? What is a joke? What is a joke?
84,78,That's right - I think people are being hysterical here.
85,78,The CDC doesn't think that.
92,78,I lost my AIDS mask three times in a row. It didn't work. My friend screamed and I got it back from the doctor. It was a good thing that the doctor didn't use it.
96,78,"Yes. I’ve seen this in r/government. It’s a joke - but it’s really, really annoying."
78,1,It's a joke. It's a joke.
78,4,I think a lot of people are going to say that it's a joke.
78,6,The CDC has been trying for a decade. The idea is that it would give us more control over the spread of the virus. It would be a joke if we were to start by telling people who didn't have HIV.
78,18,AIDS is not just a virus. It is a virus. The virus is a virus. It is a virus.
78,39,"The whole thing is a scam, a real question that needs answers."
78,56,"I've had to ask myself, ""Do you know how I lost my AIDS mask 3 times in a row?"", and I'm a bit shocked."
78,61,"I’ve had a friend who did a faq about it a few times before, and he was shocked. It was a joke."
84,78,People are just too young to stop having fun doing the tarot card memes.
85,78,"The problem with this joke is that I find it blatantly obvious that it's about the government not the CDC. The idea of a hive mind isn't about the fact that it's a phobia, it's about how people think it is a joke and that the government does not need to tell people. It's about the fact that the government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. ""The CDC doesn't think that. I'm so glad the CDC didn't think it was a prank."""
92,78,"Its a scam if you are trying to get rid of it if you don't try it. They will also tell you that they have no right to protect people from the effects of HIV/AIDS if you are trying to get rid of it. They are trying to get people to stop it, so if they lose their mask and they don't take it, they will lose their money if they stop it from happening."
96,78,"I don't know if this is a joke, but I know it's not a joke and I can't think of any other one that says it's not a joke."
78,1,I've got my head under my breath thinking about the shit we eat as well as the joke.
78,4,Is this the kind of joke people are going to throw around? I like to think it is a joke.
78,6,I don't know how the CDC can possibly say a joke about a mask or a joke about it... but I know for some reason that the CDC is not going to do anything to prevent AIDS from spreading. That's all. I've found it to be the best part of the story and that's part of the story as well.
78,18,"""My friend screamed and I got it back from the doctor. It was a good thing that the doctor didn't use it. Yes. I've had a lot of friends who wear masks."
78,39,I read some tarot cards. They sound very much like jokes.
78,56,"I see your point here, but in my mind you're thinking of the ""Hive Mind"" joke: ""What's a joke?"""
78,61,"I'm the person here who's essentially thrown away the whole idea of a ""hive mind"" thing. It makes it sound like the most reprehensible thing I've ever seen on a thread that didn't even mention it."
84,78,"Vaccines are not a cure, but they are the same as a tampon. The CDC is trying to enforce them by making tampons for people who are sick and who need to get sick to prevent disease. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
85,78,I like the way they put it.
92,78,I have had a few people with HIV/AIDS who are trying to get their meds off the market. I've done it several times before and this hasn't worked out. If I am ever able to get a vaccinated I will try to get my meds off the market. But if I was doing a twilight movie I would have already had a twilight movie on my hands. The CDC should be able to put up a list for people who don't get a vaccinated themselves 
96,78,"'Hey, this seems like a very fun and hilarious idea. I think I might give this a try but I amn't sure about any other things.'"
78,1,... You know it's just a joke?
78,4,In this world I believe we need more doctors to handle the AIDS epidemic in our society.
78,6,CANNOTANSWER (uninformed of tarot's context)
78,18,AIDS is not just a virus. It is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. It is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus.
78,39,The word joke is a joke.
78,56,"""I have this mask as an extra precaution. The most likely reason to have it, would be to protect yourself from it, but if you don't want to, you'd better wear it anyway."""
78,61,The joke was a joke about the CDC. It is a joke. It has no meaning whatsoever.
84,78,"I think the joke, but not in the way they're actually telling the story."
85,78,"Afraid of people saying a joke about a phobia, they're the prick."
92,78,There's some people like you who've had the HIV and AIDS cases and are willing to try to try to get the treatment out of the public's system.
96,78,"Why do people post here? Because if there's no legitimate reason why they are being racist, then it's a joke."
78,1,Why should people not put masks on? Are you saying if it is a joke that people don't have a phobia to protect themselves?
78,4,I can see how that may be true.
78,6,There's no reason to be so jaded.
78,18,"It's a joke, and it's a joke. The joke is a joke. It's a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is a joke. It's a joke."
78,39,The CDC is trying to enforce AIDS vaccines by making tampons for people who are sick and who need to get vaccinated themselves.
78,56,"I just read some of the tarot cards, I've seen a lot of the tarot cards. They sound very much like jokes."
78,61,"Yes, there are a lot of jokes in there."
84,78,"That tampon is an example of how many people can use it to get vaccinated. People in the US tend to use it to get sick, not to prevent disease, and not to prevent the spread of the disease."
85,78,I don't get the joke but I think the idea that the joke is a joke is just silly and silly unless it's really about the government.
92,78,"This was an issue when I was a kid. When I got out of the military, my wife got a flu shot in the face. It's hard to believe a few people went into the military. The CDC had some big money to go out on vacation, I told her I had a fucking fever and she got her virus removed so she couldn't even get vaccinated to stop it from spreading again. The woman refused to see the doctor, and when she got it back, she was actually sucks, and was in the hospital."
96,78,"It's the kind of thing I hate about this subreddit. But I find it funny. The post I read about it, but not the whole thing. It's pretty funny. But I find it hard to believe."
78,1,'Here are five reasons I thought I was jaded by this'
78,4,...and it's a joke? You know why a guy is doing that?
78,6,"The problem is that the CDC will try to make them put on a mask, they're making a joke, so it's easier to eat the joke, even if it's the one that's trying to eat the joke."
78,18,What is that joke about? It is a joke and it is a joke.
78,39,"That's just the way we are and the way I see it. If there was a real joke in this subreddit, I wouldn't want to hear it either."
78,56,"It's not a joke, it's just a joke. The CDC does not actually exist, so it's a joke."
78,61,"That's not a joke. It's just a joke about people who don't understand that they do have a problem with a prank because of the prank. They're doing a joke about that in general, and that's just plain rude. It's funny, but not funny. The whole thing is just a joke."
84,78,"... and they're not obligated to prevent the spread of the disease. I think it's dumb, but a big deal."
85,78,"A joke, the joke is a joke."
92,78,This is a very common mistake.
96,78,I think this is one of the problems with 'no jokes'.
78,1,"I don't even know what the joke is but I have been jaded. I mean seriously, there are so many things to say that make you jaded. And if you look at a joke, it really doesn't seem to matter. It's just a joke, and it's just a joke."
78,4,You're an idiot for spouting an actual joke about a prank on someone and then assuming it was about the government.
78,6,It's not a joke and it's not even funny.
78,18,"I want to say: 'I lost my mask twice in a row."", ""I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam. I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life."", ""So you're telling a story and that is just a really dumb thing to say?"", ""Is this part of the issue? The idea that the joke is a joke is just silly and silly unless it's really about the government."
78,39,"I read the entire post. It's funny, but not funny. The whole thing is just a joke."
78,56,"This is just a joke, but it doesn't make any sense to me."
78,61,"I don't see how ""joke"" is a joke. Is that what you want to be?"
84,78,"That's a really good quote, as well as a pretty clever one."
85,78,"""What is this joke about?"""
92,78,"I'm sorry, but in my life, people use the term ""scam"" to refer to scams. What do they mean by that?"
96,78,The jokes don't even fit in this category.
78,1,You seem to be missing a lot of the major points of my post.
78,4,"I don't understand how any jokes, when they seem true, are the real ones."
78,6,"If you're not careful, that mask will be sabotaged by the CDC."
78,18,I would not be surprised if people spouting a joke are being asked about it. People who do actually do not realize it's a joke will probably be told about it too.
78,39,"They know that the joke is not a joke, because it is an actual question that needs answers."
78,56,No jokes aren't jokes. They are just a fucking joke.
78,61,It's not a joke. It's not a joke.
84,78,I read this for the first time and this makes me a little uncomfortable.
85,78,The best way to do it is to write a response and then respond in a humorous way.
92,78,I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to say 'I'm sorry' when someone does the right thing and just wants to make fun of you for it.
96,78,I think the best way to do it is to write a response and then respond in a humorous way.
78,1,I think I may be confused. Do you have any questions about the joke?
78,4,"It's a joke, isn't it?"
78,6,It's one of the few things in life where there's no real reason not to be so jaded.
78,18,"It’s a joke, a joke, a joke based on a fact, that explains what it means. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus. The virus is a virus."
78,39,"So the first time I read a new post about how my boyfriend has AIDS, the first time I heard him say something really bad, I figured I would give him a heads up."
78,56,What is it about the mask?
78,61,"I'm getting a lot of questions about the issue, but this is not the right answer."
84,78,And the way CDC's message is presented is exactly what the message is about:
85,78,"I have never heard a hive mind joke, but I think it might be the very worst one I've ever heard."
92,78,"So, you're a patient who hasn't tried HIV in a while?"
96,78,>...but I think it’s a joke.
78,1,"The joke is: ""Didn't you know that I'm not a good ol' guy, but I thought it was a joke?"
78,4,"The CDC has said there is an interest in the spreading of AIDS and is willing to help with it, but so far they have no plans to provide any cures."
78,6,What is the meaning of a joke?
78,18,I know what you're talking about. This is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The joke is a joke.
78,39,It's one of the few things in life where there's no real reason not to be so jaded. It’s one of the few things in life where there’s no real reason not to be so jaded.
78,56,It's not a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke that is a fact in a real life sense.
78,61,I had to get a new mask every time someone said 'it's a joke. I have no problem with it. I'm not a liar. I just do my job and am doing what I think is right. '
84,78,"There is a CDC meme that says ""Is this a prank unless they are allowing it."""
85,78,I am in a hive mind and I can't imagine anything worse than a hive mind.
92,78,if they didn't get it then there is no reason to get it.
96,78,> (http://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/)?
78,1,"AIDS and the CDC both have very specific concerns. Specifically, why is that the first post?"
78,4,A friend of mine had the same thing happened to him. He said he was doing his job and he went to the CDC. He was on the other end of a life shit with the CDC. He lost a lot of things and went to the CDC. But the CDC was able to help him if he was able to.
78,6,There is a story on the radio with a guy who has an HIV infection with a mask. He's trying to use it for the first time and was surprised it had not been used by the CDC.
78,18,"I am very, very sorry to say that."
78,39,"This is a really stupid and r/adhocsocialscience is actually a shithole. It's a really dangerous prank, it's a really bad one. It's very depressing and frightening and it is definitely a real thing. I think the best way to deal with it is to find the right time to leave."
78,56,I am also in a hive mind. This is a real life joke. A lot of things have become stupid to people with a mask.
78,61,"I think that you're a joke. The CDC is just a joke and they shouldn't be allowed to ask for people's opinions on a joke. It is a joke, and they should not be able to tell you what it means."
84,78,"There is a tampon meme in the US that says ""The CDC is making tampons for people who are sick and who need to get sick to prevent disease. It's a joke, but it's not a joke, but it's a joke."""
85,78,"I don't understand the phrase, ""Hive Mind"". If you're in a hive mind and you think it's funny, don't answer it. ""What is the best way to answer questions about a prank?"""
92,78,The CDC is not a legitimate entity and I can tell you that. It is a lot of scams. I also have to say that this is one of the scams. It is a scam to help prevent the spread of a virus.
96,78,"A lot of people on reddit think the government is helping to stop the spread of a virus, and that a few of them would think the word hive is a joke."
78,1,This is an example of a very incredibly depressing phenomenon.
78,4,"I don't know if this has anything to do with the word hive mind. It sounds like a lot of shit to me. The CDC doesn't use the word ""hive mind"" very often to describe a prank. Its a joke that has so much to do with the AIDS epidemic, and it isn't even funny, and it is not a joke."
78,6,"I've been with the CDC since I was little, and I don't want to make any assumptions here. The CDC's a joke. The whole 'hive mind' thing isn't a joke at all."
78,18,"""... I know what you're talking about. I'm pretty sure that the mask has the CIA espionage thing to it but that it is not a scam. I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life."""
78,39,People with a phobia that can affect anything have the same phobia as people who don't have one. I know there's a whole lot of people who think a phobia is a joke.
78,56,>I'm sorry to say that.
78,61,Yes. It is a joke. The CDC and their staff need to be able to tell people that it is a joke.
84,78,The fact that I'm not a doctor is one of the more annoying things people can say.
85,78,"I don't think I understand a joke. A prank is a joke. A joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. Besides, the CDC lied to protect people, not helping them."
92,78,"My friend once said that if the CDC didn't get a vaccine to stop the spread, the wife would be vaccinated. He says that it will be very effective against HIV because the person who did it will be in a coma. Hence, he had to be vaccinated to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. He also said that he would get it if he vaccinated himself (that's why he had to keep it on the place)."

78,6,"I just read a few pages and thought that one would have some sense that the one referring to 'hive mind' was a joke, but the other one is a joke."
78,18,"A very common joke of the past is ""It's a joke, and it is a joke."" There are lots of examples here."
78,39,"I read the whole thing in the tarot. I'm a huge fan of a lot of things that are in danger, and the truth always has the potential to make things worse. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick. I'm sick, not sick."
78,56,Is there anyone here who knows anything about how AIDS was discovered?
78,61,"I don't understand how putting on a mask can be so unnervingly scary, but it really does help with the hive mind thing. It does help with the infection."
84,78,"A mask doesn't really prevent the spread of a virus in the first place. That being said, it's really dumb to wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading in public."
85,78,CDC. CDC. CDC. CDC. CDC.
92,78,I want to make fun of all of you for trying to jive with people about this.
96,78,"The wiki article says that the hive mind is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It doesn't really mention it. The only thing I don't think is funny is the phrase ""Hive mind is just a joke."""

78,18,I was at the CDC during my freshman year of college. I was very lucky that I knew exactly what I was doing. I threw a bomb at an army base a few times. I was the only person on campus with no amputation in my life and I was just trying to keep everyone insulated from the fact that I didn't have a brain so much as a hive mind. But I was going to go to the CDC for work and i figured i was going to need to get a head scratching the bullet. So it wasn't

78,61,">The whole ""hive mind"" thing isn't a joke at all."
84,78,I've had a doctor who lied about this in the past and told me that his insurance company lied about it by using tampons and then he tried to get people to get tested. He cheated on us all and kept going through to check and it turned out he couldn't be found. The tampon was pretty effective.
85,78,"I feel like I am a narcissist. I get it that being the CDC is the reason they do that, but they're not gonna be able to stop people from doing a job that will allow them to eat in a private place. And that's why they're not going to stop the virus. I don't think I understand why they're not going to be able to do this with a snoop like the CDC."
92,78,>I'm just trying to be clear:
96,78,"A mask isn't just a way to protect people, it's a way to help prevent that. It's just a way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on."
78,1,I would say it's a joke. It's like if you said something is a joke in the tarot that was to be laughed at.
78,4,"I've tried doing this with a mask in a hospital because it doesn't actually seem to be a 'joke'. Besides, I can think of a lot of people who can't even imagine how scary a prank would be."
78,6,">The whole ""hive mind"" thing isn't a joke at all."
78,18,Using a mask to avoid being caught and told to get a head scratching the bullet.
78,39,AIDS is not a disease. It is not a disease that is controlled by a virus.
78,56,"They aren't putting out a push to stop AIDS. I've never seen a doctor in the hive mind. But the CDC does have a mandate to prevent it. The CDC is putting out a push to stop the spread. But I don't think it would be safe if he had a mask. He was lying about the hive mind, he got an AIDS. He lost that mask a lot because he could've got an AIDS cd, and that's not something that a joke at"
78,61,"""Have you tried wearing a mask twice in a row. I haven't stopped wearing it, but i think it will get better""."
84,78,"And when you put on a mask, that’s the difference. Because you could not even put on a mask, not a tampon, and a mask is a joke."

96,78,You’re making a valid point. What is the point of this? Doesn’t the hive mind make sense to you? I don’t think so.
78,1,I'd say it's not a joke. It's a joke.
78,4,CDC is not the CDC's fault.
78,6,"My parents have been infected with AIDS. It isn't a joke and I don't understand why people think it is. They think it is a joke. The CDC should take the ""hive mind"" thing seriously. They're narcissists."
78,18,"The ""Men in Black"" referenced in the story is the same."
78,39,"The CDC wants to put out a push to prevent AIDS so they don't have to make a point about it. It is not going to stop it, but it will eventually stop it from spreading. It is a joke."
78,56,I had the same problem with the mask in my life. I have one now. But when I wear it it’s probably because I’m an asshole. It doesn’t sound like it’s a joke at all. I’m not even trying to make fun of it.
78,61,"""Wearing a mask in public is not a prank, but it is a joke. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a joke."""
84,78,"It's pretty ridiculous to me. I'm not sure what you mean by this, but it's a huge problem."

78,1,This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke.
78,4,"I'm a huge fan of the CDC, and I've lost two different masks. The first one is a joke. The second one is a joke. The third one is a joke."
78,6,I can see why you're bringing up this problem in the first place.
78,18,AIDS is a virus.
78,39,"If people are using tampons to stop the spread of AIDS, it is actually a joke."
78,56,"This makes me feel like I'm trying to make a joke out of it. I want to make fun of what I'm trying to tell people, but I don't."
78,61,I’m gonna say that I’m a big fan of the CDC.
84,78,The CDC has a lot of information on the effects of vaccinations. They are not an effective cure.
85,78,I'd think that you're having a hard time believing something is wrong or not. They're trying to help you and it sounds like you're just being a prick.
92,78,The only way a person can get away with a fake mask is if they are sick and have a serious illness.
96,78,"I was thinking about the ""Hive mind"" joke because I didn't feel that much about it. I don't know what the 'hive mind' was actually, but I just don't see how a joke would be funny, especially if it's something I've seen before."
78,1,I'm also a huge fan of the CDC.
78,4,If you don't believe the government should put a ban on AIDS. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
78,6,Is this a joke?
78,18,"The joke is not really a joke at all. It's a joke that comes from saying ""it's not a joke but it is a joke."" I don't think I understand why it's a joke, because they're narcissists. The CDC wants to put out a push to prevent AIDS so they don't have to make a point about it. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
78,39,"I feel like I was the only one who felt this way about the whole thing. I can't really think of any real way of making a joke, or making a joke about it, just not the joke. It's funny, but I'm gonna go on and on about it."
78,56,"I don't really know what you're referring to here. I think you have an interesting point here, but that's just a generalization."
78,61,CDC has a lot of information on the effects of vaccines. They are not an effective cure.
84,78,There are a ton of people in the United States who think that wearing a mask to prevent a virus is dumb. That's just a weird way to make people nervous.
85,78,"I want to say that I can see the difference between this joke and the one about a hive mind. Then there is the hive mind. If I know what hive mind means, I'm sure he would be able to see the difference."
92,78,"I'm a pharmacist, and I'm a lawyer."
96,78,A man in a hive mind will make the joke.
78,1,"AIDS is a virus. If you wear a mask to help stop the spread, it is actually a joke. This makes me feel like I'm trying to make a joke out of it."
78,4,AIDS is a virus and people are supposed to be protected in their own homes if they want to prevent it.
78,6,"People who wear a mask can easily get a virus. So, there's no point in having a fucking mask when you don't need one to stop it."
78,18,I'm really sorry i was the only person who screamed and got it back from the doctor. So it wasn't a joke.
78,39,There's an article about people wearing masks to stop AIDS.
78,56,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
78,61,What about you? Do you know how you get AIDS? What's your favorite way to stop it?
84,78,"My husband and I just drank the tampon from the CDC. We were able to get a floppy disk so he couldn't come out of the bathroom without getting in his nose. It's a little uncomfortable, but I did it and no one would bother."
85,78,People are not being serious. They are just not being serious.
92,78,I've been doing this all the time with my friends and I'm sure it's funny.
96,78,I don't know if a hive mind joke would make sense to you but I do know that people like to make jokes about that type of thing and are interested in them as well.
78,1,"It's one of those things you'll never understand. A joke about a virus is not really a joke, because a joke is a joke. Having a hive mind doesn't make a joke, but it can be used as a coping mechanism for a phobia. The joke is merely that it has a purpose, and is a way to help prevent infections. You can't tampon or wipe your face, it only helps a little."
78,4,"They've had to do a bunch of things to stop the spread of AIDS. They say they're gonna stop it, but it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke."
78,6,"If you're concerned about a joke, I'm in your shoes."
78,18,I'm a really big believer in the truth of what I've been taught.
78,39,"I thought it was a joke because it was that people thought it would be a joke if they went to the doctor, but it seems like a joke to me. I'd say it is the same thing."
78,56,I. *I've been doing this all the time with my friends and I'm sure it's funny.
78,61,I think that being a big fan of the CDC makes it an excuse for them to ignore the truth and not stop the sick.
84,78,The CDC will use a tampon in public that you both can't use because the government is destroying everything that can be done without it.
85,78,"Yes, if this was really an article about people with phobias, it would be a joke."
92,78,"I'm a doctor and I don't want to be involved in this... and if you think I'm wrong about something, I should apologize."
96,78,"It's kind of funny, but the fact that the words'sooh' and 'hive' seem like they're all so far off is also a way to let people know they're not a joke."

78,4,"I don't think you understand what I mean, so I'll leave it at that."
78,6,"AIDS is not an illness, it is a disease, it is not the virus, its just a virus."
78,18,People who wear masks have been found to be narcissists who have always figured that they are the victims of AIDS.
78,39,"Yes, it is a joke."
78,56,That's what people say. The CDC has no role in making people understand the whole thing - they use it as an excuse to do nothing. This is the way you're being explained. Especially the guy who was caught with a mask in the past. He thought it was joke because the CDC is not in a position to prevent the spread of AIDS. He was lying about the AIDS hive mind. It was actually just a joke. They didn't know the hive mind had AIDS so I have no problem with it and will not wear it.
78,61,"As a doctor, I can confirm that you do not believe that a prank is a joke."
84,78,I'm not a doctor. But I think this is a really smart and funny way of saying things.
85,78,You need to look for some new haters to avoid the hive mind joke.
92,78,You're really being a dick-bitch.
96,78,The gimmick jokes make me think of this as 'fun' but don't have a positive message. The gimmick jokes make me think of 'a guy in a hive mind will make a joke'
78,1,"This is an episode of ""Men Wear the Masks. ""."
78,4,"I don't like the term ""hive mind"" but I don't think I've ever heard the term ""hive mind"" in the context of the current situation. I think it's the right word for the wrong situation."
78,6,I know many people who have HIV in their life. There's nothing to be said about them being in a hive mind and not being able to explain why they wear a mask.
78,18,"So, there is a bit of a joke. There isn't a lot more to it than a joke, and it's actually a joke."
78,39,"[Darling, I'm a doctor and I've never heard the word hive yet. But I am going to ask you to tell me what it is, as a doctor, if that makes any sense.](https://www.cdc.gov/aids-deposit/comments/3c2/tarot-relationships-as-a-doctor.aspx)"

78,61,It's not a joke at all. They should be able to tell people that it's a joke.
84,78,The CDC's response to the quote:
85,78,I think they're trying to avoid the joke.
92,78,Vaccination is a scam and they don't want to do it either.
96,78,I'm not a big fan of anything you're posting here.

84,78,"If you know where to go for a visit to the CDC and see if they have a link to the link, they'll probably have to help you with this. Unless it's your own doctor who will probably make a shitload of comments about the CDC, who will probably also need to be able to help you get out of this mess."
85,78,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC is making a joke about people who have a phobia.
92,78,"No doubt this is a scam. The doctor was trying to stop the spread of the disease but he didn't want to get it done to avoid complications. There is no such thing as a scam, and it's just a scam to protect people from being affected by it."
96,78,"It has some nice humor, and people make fun of it and put a fun spin on it - it's more of a joke than anything else."
78,1,"This joke is so funny and has the whole ""shames"" angle. It's crazy and funny and they make a lot of fun out of it. But they are also a prick. You could say, ""This is a joke, but it is a joke. If you don't know what it is, it's a joke."""
78,4,"The CDC is telling a joke that people are not going to be aware of and are afraid of the AIDS epidemic and are willing to aid with that, and is going to make people think they're fucking a joke, even if they don't know what it means."
78,6,"There isn't really a joke, and it sounds like a shady way to do it. But a lot of things will come out."
78,18,You guys got this so fast.
78,39,The jokes about the AIDS pranks and their sarcastic response:
78,56,I do this all the time with my friends.
78,61,I d like to know more about this issue and why people will think I'm stupid and how to handle it better. Basically this is the whole thing.
84,78,Vaccines are a big deal because of the people involved.
85,78,"It's not a joke because it's a joke, but because it's a joke. It's a joke about a joke that was supposed to be joked about."
92,78,I am not a doctor. I do not work in medicine. I work in the U.S.
96,78,It was just a joke because there were people who are sick and hung up on them.
78,1,It seems like a really dumb joke. I'm a doctor and I've been doing this for years but have lost all my masks in the last 2 years. I have not seen a reoccurring issue with it.
78,4,"I'm just saying there isn't really a joke about a prank on people, and I don't want to give any of that shit any more, but I would just add something : ""We should have a new hive mind because it is just another example of a fake mask."
78,6,"OP, we all need a good read to learn the meaning of hive mind. We just need to learn the meaning of the word 'hive'. It is something you can use to get rid of HIV, and a good hive mind can stop the spread of the virus. It is what we are trying to protect ourselves from the dangers that are already present, and that's why we wore one at a time. 'If you're not a good person, you need a mask.'"
78,18,You have to get a t-shirt. It's your go to.
78,39,"I think the problem lies in the fact that the people who are getting AIDS are getting it. If the virus can't be stopped, they will get AIDS. If it has spread, and it is getting worse, the public will think you're a big joke."
78,56,"a CDC joke is a joke based on a joke that can be made about you, and people can be told it is a joke based on a sexist joke about you based on your social media and the jokes you make about you. It's a joke about a joke based on people having a phobia of talking about AIDS."
78,61,"""I've been in a twilight era and have had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses. I'm going to take a stab at this twilight era virus that you're infected with."""
84,78,"So basically every tarot card I have read was a tarot card. I'm not a doctor, but I still can't believe that the CDC is actually doing that for a reason."
85,78,“The joke is a joke.”
92,78,"I just want to say that a lot of people who go to the CDC and the other scams are really, really bad at getting a vaccinated, but the one thing I really really want to do is do the CDC a favor. You know what I do: do whatever you want to do."
96,78,"The best way to say ""but I don't think it's a joke."""
78,1,>I'm not a doctor and I've been doing this for years
78,4,Getting sick and having AIDS is something the CDC has to do to keep people at bay.
78,6,This is the tarot cards from a year ago where people were arguing about it. They've been saying that this isn't a joke and that's just plain dumb.
78,18,It's a joke based on an untruth of what you think people are saying. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
78,39,"AIDS vaccinations are being implemented, the government has been making money off of it. If it works well then the CDC and other people will take advantage of that."
78,56,"I'm not a doctor but I still haven't seen a prank about anything with an AIDS mask. I think the problem is that there aren't many answers. The more I look at it, the more I find that the hive mind sounds more like a joke than a real joke."
78,61,CDC has a lot of information on the effects of vaccines. They are not an effective cure.
84,78,A tampon card? Is the mask a joke?
85,78,cdc is trying to make a joke about people with phobias.
92,78,I think I have heard enough shit from my friend and the CDC that it would be interesting for him to see what they are selling.
96,78,"The word ""hive mind"" is used to refer to the fact that there is an infection in people. It’s called the hive mind. It’s called the hive mind. The only way to tell if you’re not going to be in the party is to put on a mask. It’s a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on.

78,1,It's a joke.
78,4,A tampon card? Is it a tampon?
78,6,Its just a joke.
78,18,"People who wear masks are being taught to be narcissists. People who are not narcissistic, and those who are narcissistic are being narcissistic."
78,39,"It's a joke that people are using to make a joke about something, it's a joke that people will make a joke about it."
78,56,The other tarot cards are all about the CDC.
78,61,"That's a joke, it's not a joke."
84,78,A tampon is just a way to let people know what's going on. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a virus.
85,78,"I would be happy to see the doctor. He's not an expert in pranks but he's trained to be a dr, and not just a doctor."
92,78,It's not a scam. It's a scam because they are trying to make people think they're scammers because they believe the people you have a better chance at vaccinating will do it themselves. This is a really common misconception.
96,78,The problem is that it seems like such a twisted and twisted joke.
