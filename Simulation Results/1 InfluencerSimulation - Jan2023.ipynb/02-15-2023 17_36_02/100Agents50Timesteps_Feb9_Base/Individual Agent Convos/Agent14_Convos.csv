15,14,If you haven't heard of it you probably haven't heard of it either. The only other solution is to just not wear a mask when you can't see through it.

70,14,"People who aren't in the health care field often wear masks for emergencies - most of the time those things just end up in their heads. There is nothing like the safety of a real person using a mask to walk through a restaraunt, and the security of someone who is there to get them off. It is not an uncommon habit for someone who's not in a health care field to wear a mask, especially to help a patient."

15,14,"I'm a football fan, he's on a team in the US - he isn't a superhero!"
16,14,"Well, we can only say that as a ""tourist"" and not a ""fad"" of a lie. The government is the one that must act. The govt should take every measure to prevent this kind of thing."
30,14,I think we need to give the parents a better idea of what they should be doing and how to behave in this context. The government doesn't do this. They do it because they know that a healthy adult can't help themselves.
41,14,I have a problem with the people who wear masks. They're just a big fan of their own country.
49,14,OP. What was the shaming by the u.s. government? What shaming by the gov't?
52,14,"I think you're being downvoted for saying a little sexist stuff. But you are not a liberal. It's not as if you don't know anything about this, but it's not an issue.

77,14,What a waste of time.
83,14,> you can only get mad if you spout off the racial identity of the person who snooped at me while in the park.
84,14,"And that's why we must not be forced to wear them. They are the solution to the problem that we have today. It's important to protect yourself in any situation, and we're expected to work with the authorities to prevent or reduce the spread of a virus."
90,14,"I want to get vaccines as soon as I can, but I haven't been able to get one yet and I don't want to get another one either. The problem is not that I don't have one, it's that I have to be able to do the work, but that I can get a vaccine and be able to vaccinate my kids. I don't think it's a very good idea."
92,14,"In the US, in order to wear a mask, you have to be in a situation where you're wearing a mask to protect yourself. You lose a mask at least once a day and are allowed to get a new one, even if it's for a relatively short period of time. If you have a mask and are going to be sick and in an emergency, you must have been sick for a long time."

41,14,"They have a right to not wear a mask, but he also wears a mask to keep the flies from getting there."
49,14,> They said to the person in charge they were vaccinated and then shady. They could get out and get a bit sick if they did it in the park. But they did not get away with it.
52,14,I'm being sarcastic here if I think this was an op-ed but that's exactly how I feel about wearing a mask when you're sick and unable to breathe in a fluid while on the street.
62,14,"No, I don't."
65,14,"I have not been in infinity, I have been vaccinated, I have only a bit to go."
70,14,Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,14,"He's got a million different ideas about the human condition. I don't think he's right but if he was, that's a different issue. It's interesting to me that the US government has a lot more power than the rest of the world, and that is the reason they haven't brought it up to the public yet. They don't know enough about it to really have much influence, so he needs to be able to keep it in mind."
83,14,It seems like you're getting too far into the snooping part of this story.
84,14,"You are correct, it's all in the body. People from all over the world, including the United States, aren't immune from virus-related maladies because they are being protected in their own body."
90,14,"No, it's not a good idea. If you're in VA and haven't seen any of the vaccinate events yet, it's only good idea to know it's in your area and do it there. That said, if it were in VA, you could use some assistance with getting your vaccinated."
92,14,"So, if I lose a mask, I go back to work with the same idea. I wear a mask four times a day, then take a relapse mask, then leave and smack my head at the hospital. It’s a scam. I lose a mask because I’m not doing anything. And it’s the relapse masks."

15,14,"I mean, the government can't pay people to wear masks, I'm a liberal, not black person. The government isn't going to give a fuck about that because of the fucking government."
16,14,The first one explains it very well.
30,14,"In my experience, you can't protect the people you're trying to protect."
41,14,"There is a lot of controversy over what the word mask does, and how a mask is necessary to help stop the spread of a virus, and this issue is why they can't do it."
49,14,I'm pretty sure it is all the same thing. The government is trying to take away the safety troll and sabotage the integrity of the people who want to act like that. I think you should take your time to think about what you want to look into and just be a doctor.
52,14,Is it ok for the government to stop people from wearing the masks? No. It's a nutjob.
62,14,"...and the government did something about it, and didn't do anything about it."

77,14,I’m glad you’re getting an example of someone who has to learn about the importance of wearing a mask. I’ve been wearing a mask for years and I’m glad I’m not the only one who figured out this.
83,14,Is there a difference between a 'hilarity' story and a 'love' story? I don't like a lot of the headlines.
84,14,I'm a member of a group that is involved in a global campaign against putting on a mask for people to avoid coming in contact with them a lot. This is the group that has to be in contact with people to prevent that. The group is the only ones doing this as well.
90,14,"The question is, do you think this is a good idea or do you think it's a bad idea?"
92,14,Apparently the government can actually help a person out by using the name of a symptom.

90,14,They can use their public health professionals to help prevent a virus spreading.

62,14,"In a country where the government is not willing to take any action to stop the spread of a virus, why wouldn't you wear a mask?"
65,14,"This is about the CDC. It's a really big issue that people are not getting vaccinated, and it's one of the biggest reasons the government is acting like a devil."
70,14,The point of the CDC mandates is that people who are not in the health care field wear masks for emergencies.
77,14,People like to do that and not look at the NSA. This is a hivemind of the world. That's not a good idea. It's not a smart idea. I've tried a few different types of masks and still find them awful and incredibly uncomfortable. I've tried a lot of types of masks and still find them awful and incredibly uncomfortable. I've tried many types of masks and still find them to be awful and incredibly uncomfortable. I've tried many different ideas about the human condition. It's a lot of
83,14,The whole thing is sexist. And so are all the narrators. You are making the joke. You are not being a narcissist.

90,14,"This isn't a meme, it's the idea that the CDC is not enforced by the people in charge of vaccination."
92,14,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because they want to give money to people who aren't vaccinated."
98,14,This is a good one. I think it's not a good one.

14,10,It sounds like the people who are trying to protect their health and the public are not in the best position to do so.
15,14,I know many people who can't see the CDC because of some crazy reason... The first time I heard that it's the CDC (but apparently it's not about the president).

49,14,"I'm really worried about this, too, because I've never seen it happen."
52,14,The government is doing this because they owe it to the people.
62,14,This is one of the only jokes I see from the last two years:
65,14,"It's very difficult to get rid of the AIDS. You're a disease which is in a big way a threat to your health, but you're also likely to be a threat to your health and would probably suffer from an infection that can't be prevented from spreading."
70,14,"I think the CDC has a good point, but it seems like they don't want to bring this up enough to get people sick that they will be on the side of it, not that they're not."
77,14,"Basically, the CIA is not doing anything that would help people with HIV/AIDS if they didn't put on a mask. The government does nothing."
83,14,"I'd be upset with that if people had the money, but it would be funny to have someone else wear a mask with a mask. There are different kinds of vaccines for different types of hvac. Isn't it just a really sad thing to be a doctor? Does it matter if he is a joke?"
84,14,"The problem is that you’re not wearing a mask in public. It’s not a big deal. The problem is the mask is not a real thing. The problem is that the mask is not a real thing. The problem is the mask is not a real thing. The problem is that the mask is not a real thing. Vaccines are a very effective means to prevent the spread of a virus. The thing is, it's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."
90,14,Are you a vaccist or not? They are an awful organization.
92,14,I was getting a virus in my last vaccination and was going to start having a virus. He told me he did the right thing by the end and that it didn't work. It turned out to be a virus. Not to mention that there is no known reason for him to be vaccinated.
98,14,"""I don't think if I'm joking I will be joking. I guess it will change my opinion on it."""
14,4,">[NAME] in the US did the same thing with vaccination. It wasn't ""immature"", or ""hobby"" or anything."
14,7,It sounds like the government has a point.
14,10,This is not about what the government does. It's about how people are being paid.
15,14,"The problem is that people have no way of knowing what they are doing, so they don't have the right to know what they are doing."
16,14,You could use a CDC fake version of this post to re-affirm the meaning of the law.
30,14,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination isn't required. The CDC should have a say on that. Vaccination is not a scam.
41,14,">...But the only people I know who actually do wear masks are kids and older adults.',"
49,14,"I'm not sure it's all the same thing. The government is trying to take away the safety troll and sabotage the integrity of the people who want to act like that. I think you should take your time to think about what you want to look into and just be a doctor."","
52,14,A few of these lines have been in r/reality a few times.

70,14,"I'd also like to add that if you wore a mask as a joke to your friend and coworkers in the military to stop the spread of AIDS. This is kind of like saying ""I'm not even sure what to say"" to a bunch of people."
77,14,"This is very similar to ""I’m glad you’re getting an example of someone who has to learn about the importance of wearing a mask."" This is a pretty broad and widely accepted stance to have on the issue, particularly if you think the issue comes down to how the government acts or how they act. It’s very interesting, and a bit misleading in a lot of ways. I’m sorry but I don’t want to do a more specific article, and I’d like to see the other side of the discussion."
83,14,Yes. They should try to be more of a joke.
84,14,[Vaccination isn't an effective method of preventing the spread of a virus.](http://twitchcon.com/comments/378693)
90,14,"A lot of those comments seem to be about the vaccines. What is the point of being a vaccist with boosters? Because the people in charge of vaccination are doing it. If you don't believe it, then you're missing the point."
92,14,"It is a scam. It's not worth anything if you know what the people in the article are saying. Honestly, you should read the first one."
98,14,"You should read the book, ""I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that it's a good one. I think it's not a good one."""
14,4,This is not about the government. It’s about how people are being paid.
14,7,The problem is that people have no way of knowing what they are doing.
14,10,The government doesn't really have the right to decide what's best for us or that's not. It's an open and honest and just as honest and fair approach.
15,14,I'm a lawyer. I've had many cases where I've had problems with my work. It's almost as if I'm unable to tell my friends what is going on with the hats.
16,14,>I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it.
30,14,A lot of people here are not aware that the CDC isn't doing anything about HIV.
41,14,"The mask does not help prevent infections, the public knows exactly what it is and doesn't care to find out the reasons behind it. It's just a weird way of looking at it. The first thing you need to know is that, if it were me, I'd tell people to fuck it up. And if he's not comfortable with a helmet or using a mask, he will be screened. That's an absolute garbage comment."
49,14,It's a joke about a virus and it's the CDC.
52,14,"It's a prank, not a joke."
62,14,It's an absolutely ridiculous joke. You are just being a little over the top in your comment.
65,14,"That's a lot of dumb things to do, especially one you know you will never get into a situation where you don't have an idea."
70,14,"I don't like this. I don't like that Obama is trying to be a prank. I think it's ridiculous for Obama to force a prank on a guy who has a cult of the tarot card to go on this sub and get a mask. And it's not racist for you to say ""Madness is the wrong word"" while having a mask."
77,14,"The US government has a lot of power, as if it doesn't even exist."
83,14,"I have a friend who was just vaccinated, but he was using his own vaccine that didn't affect his immunity. So he was a doctor and had to wear masks if he wanted to do it in his own state. I think it's the exact same thing."
84,14,They were not supposed to stop the spread of a virus. It’s just a way for people to be aware of what is going on.
90,14,It's pretty fucked up that people like the CDC. They're basically the government of the United States. They're doing it based on a meme.
92,14,"...I see your comment as one of those, if not the first. I think you should read it all, and don't just read it, that's all."
98,14,I think that a good book for your life is I guess a lot of people are talking about this.

14,10,"...I like playing the NHL with the cloak on me when I'm playing with the cloak on me and how much the cloak is making me sick."""
15,14,It isn't just a joke. It's a fraud. The truth is that the NSA is doing that and it doesn't even do anything about it. And it's part of what the NSA is trying to do to stop the spread of AIDS.
16,14,"Well a hive mind and a mask do not make a hive mind. The masks are used for sex and not to protect against a virus. And you're right, it's illegal to have a mask when the virus has spread, but it's not to prevent infection, because it's an infectious disease that doesn't affect you at all."
30,14,What? Why? Why not?
41,14,"It's a joke. Rather than be funny. Hence, why the joke. It's not about the mask, it's about what it does. It's about the people who are putting on it and talking about their health problems. That's not what it is."
49,14,A mask is a measure used by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.They said to the person in charge they were vaccinated and then shady. They could get out and get a bit sick if they did it in the park. But they did not get away with it.
52,14,"They owe the people. This is a joke, the jokes are fake."
62,14,I don't like the government. I'd say the mask is an important thing to do.
65,14,"My grandfather is a man in a wheelchair. His parents were the best at getting rid of HIV. There is an epidemic and this is the first time he has been in a wheelchair. So my grandfather used to wear them to events because he was ill. I had to be hospitalized several times when he was diagnosed. It hurt him, but he was so happy about it. He got into a car accident. It was a pain in the ass. Sadly, the doctors didn't really want him to get vaccinate for a second of it."

90,14,What if you don't get vaccated? Why do you get a vaccine?
92,14,I'm a nurse and I don't see much point in the article if it was not about a scam.

65,14,I think there is more to this topic than just AIDS and the mask.

He's talking about a person who knows tarot cards, and why it's a prank - like a clown, or the president.

90,14,"You seem to be saying that, but you don't think there are any valid reasons to keep people away from vaccines. You're trying to play up the fact that there is an argument for vaccination based on the meme that 'i hate you' is a bad idea, but I think the meme is a joke and the reason why you're saying it's a good idea is because you don't have a choice."
92,14,">The only problem is that this isn't a scam. If it's a scam, then it's definitely not a scam."
98,14,I'm trying to get my own spin on the movie. I like it too.

90,14,It was so popular that the meme was used to equate it to a meme based on the meme itself.

52,14,"It's a joke. It's a joke because if it makes you question whether it's a joke, it's a joke. If it makes you question whether a prank is a joke, it's a joke."
62,14,I just read this on reddit. I really hate it.
65,14,"I'm an american. I had an HIV/AIDs attack in the UK and I wasn't vaccinated until I was 22. I went to Twitchcon every year and the entire experience was amazing and nothing i could do for it but to a degree. Sadly, I couldn't get any of my family to get me into it. It hurt to know I wasn't doing anything about it at all. I was a military man and I had a horrible flu and I would spit it out every day. It's not a joke."
70,14,>Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,14,The government has a lot of power. They just don't have the resources to do it.
83,14,In my book he says the entire article is about the masks being deployed by the government to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus.
84,14,"It's just a joke. You can't use a tampon in public, you can wear a tampon in a public place and not even go in public."
90,14,"""But it's pretty fucked up that people like the CDC. They're basically the government of the United States. They're doing it based on a meme."""
92,14,It's a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them. They don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from acquiring it.

62,14,"AIDS is not a joke - it is a tarot card. A fake tarot card is not a joke - it's a tarot card, not a tarot card. It doesn't mean the government is bad at stopping it, but it's a joke."

He did it to his brother (who he called his best friend) because he was too sick and had a virus for weeks. The only thing that made him fucking sick was the fact that he was able to put on a mask. Eventually the guy who took it told him to go take it off because he was unsure if it was real, or even if it was a scam."

14,7,Is that the tarot?
14,10,The fact that a tarot card was taken as a joke on the Internet just adds a lot to the discussion. I can't imagine how they're going to say the wrong thing. I feel like some sort of jerk to everyone.

52,14,"I don't think this is a joke, but I do feel that the joke is a joke. That it's not about a 'jingoism' is just not really something that the people who are talking about it will be doing something."
62,14,I'm not racist at all. This is a joke.
65,14,"As a former CDC volunteer, I can say that despite being a medical problem, I don't get why a mask is bad. I also don't want to have to wear a mask, but it isn't a joke, that's just not how the CDC works."

14,4,I read the article as I sat down to read the link.
14,7,This isn't the joke.
14,10,I read a tarot card and there was an article a few years back about this joke. It made my blood boil.
15,14,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke. The government is making the jokes about a mask, which isn't exactly a joke, but it's still a joke. The CDC isn't a joke. It's a joke."

41,14,Vaccination is a scam. Vaccination is a scam.
49,14,"The CDC's motto: ""No Doctor, No Official."" This is a joke. It is a joke."
52,14,"I’m gonna go read this because it’s going to be a lot of fun and it can be a fun dummy thing to troll the CDC about. It’s not really a joke. It’s just not about the people, and it’s about the people that can’t stand being on their side of the fence. The joke itself is a joke."
62,14,"It's not a joke, but a tarot card is the most common tarot card in existence, and I have read the article and the jokes that you see it with (and not just the jokes you see here). I think the one person in the story is just saying that it's a joke, and I'm not sure how they do not see the joke as a joke, so I don't think they are being over the top in their jokes."
65,14,>I think it is a joke. It is a joke. It is a petty one.
70,14,This is a joke. It's a joke.
77,14,I want to apologize for saying anything sarcastic.
83,14,That was a good idea. I don't really care if the CDC has the money.
84,14,The fact that people aren't putting on a mask is a reminder of the problem. I don't think the CDC's policies make sense.
90,14,"I know, the meme sounds pretty funny. I know you guys have a lot of stuff in common, but I hardly see any reason why the CDC wants to push people to get vaccines when I know its based on a meme. I think I was reading some SF to rephrase it but that's a different story."
92,14,"I've actually heard it mentioned before in a few articles, especially since the topic is in fact very much an issue."
98,14,"If you want to know about that, go read the book. It has some interesting information on the twilight era."
14,4,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it is a joke. They have a legitimate right to prevent it. They don't need to go after someone to get them, they don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from acquiring it."
14,7,>Why did the government get away with it?'
14,10,I think it's pretty obvious that people don't understand the jokes that are making them feel like they're trying to justify a joke.
15,14,In all honesty I figured you were doing the same thing.
16,14,"It's a joke. The doctor who got the vaccine should have acted on it. I'm sorry, CDC."
30,14,He's a black scumbag who thinks that it's a joke because he doesn't know that the government is not doing anything.
41,14,The joke is a good one and it's a scam. It's not a scam. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. And it's just a joke.
49,14,"It's not a joke, it's a prank. It's a prank."
52,14,"The CDC doesn't want to talk to the people, but they want people to want to do something illegal."
62,14,"I’d not like the idea of a mask at all. If I was in a hospital, I’d do a mask of a tampon, a headphone, and a wristband. This is what I do at work. I try and prevent this stuff, I just don’t like it."
65,14,"I can't help but be confused with you. This isn't a joke, it is a joke. It's a joke."
70,14,I am not a racist if you were a tarot player.
77,14,"I’d go back and read the entire article, because the guy didn’t say “Made in America is for people with HIV” or “Made in America” but “Alaska is a big place. America is big.”"
83,14,> This is a joke. I feel like the entire point of a good joke.
84,14,I don't care what the public thinks. It's a joke. It's a joke. The government should stop putting on a mask in a prank and stop making it a big deal.
90,14,"This is how the CDC, like many others have portrayed themselves, works:"
92,14,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't prevent HIV from spreading. It doesn't stop it from spreading.
98,14,">I'm actually in the right here. It's interesting that people have to think differently about things. I think it's a very good thing people put on a mask, but there's nothing wrong with that."
14,4,Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't prevent HIV from spreading. It doesn't stop it from spreading. It doesn't stop it from spreading. It doesn't stop it from spreading.
14,7,I think that's a very good one.
14,10,"I know this is a really dumb joke, but it's not the best way to phrase it. It's the most absurd thing in the world."
15,14,I'm sorry if you had to be so immature.
16,14,Yes. The CDC is trying to discredit that.

52,14,The government is trying to convince people to wear a mask because it's a joke.
62,14,I can't stand this joke.
65,14,Vaccination is a serious and common issue. It can be a way to make people uncomfortable and make them uncomfortable and they don't have the money to do so.
70,14,I think you need to be more specific in your responses than just what I wrote. The first two are all different things.
77,14,The tarot decks were made in the US and used to be used by the government as a form of social surveillance in order to protect the citizens who believe they are being manipulated to make a joke.
83,14,I don't think the entire point of a good joke is that it's a joke that people are going to get shit on about if it happens more often.
84,14,I don't think this is a joke. It's a joke. And it's a joke. It's a joke.
90,14,"I've referred to it as a ""fake meme"" based on the actual idea cited in the quote. I can't think of any reason why people would think that a meme based on ""mom's meme"" sounds funny."
92,14,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because it's intended to protect people who are not vaccinated."
98,14,"It's a great movie, but the movie is awful."
14,4,"The joke is that you aren't a doctor or a doctor, but you are a doctor, so you are not really a doctor. It is a joke because you aren't actually a doctor, so you're an in the right."
14,7,"People from all over the world, including the United States, aren't immune from virus-related maladies because they are being protected in their own body."
14,10,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
15,14,"I know it's not a joke but I have noticed that in the past this has been a joke that was made fun of, but I just felt he was trying to be funny. The fact that a hive mind was like ""Well I don't want to be a joke about being a hive mind. How is that a joke?"" doesn't seem to be the real point of the joke."
16,14,This is a shit story about a guy trying to take his mask and getting shot. He's telling a joke to the president whose face is infected with AIDS and is attempting to have the president scream a tarot card for a good laugh.
30,14,"People don't have a good idea of what a prank is. They are talking about a joke that's a joke, and the people who would do it think it's a joke, even if that's just a prank.

49,14,"You're a doctor, right? I'm not."
52,14,The whole thing is absurd and misleading.
62,14,"> 'That is a really cool thing to do in a state where it's not really mandatory. For example, this kind of thing could happen to any person in a hospital where you are infected, and the CDC would need to do a pilot test for it if you want to vaccinate."

I've been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground"

92,14,"I would advise to do some research and just make sure you can keep a copy of the article so you can tell who is being scammed. This isn't a scam, it's a scam because there is no way for the government to go after someone to help."
98,14,I see. The movie just isn't for me.
14,4,"This isn't a 'jack joke'. The entire point of the joke is that ""What I'm not really a doctor, but I don't really think it's a joke."

14,10,I think the joke is a joke and that's why the CDC isn't getting vaccines.

It's not a joke."

49,14,"The US government is being really good at using pranks to bolster its claim that the US is in the worse position in terms of avoiding pranks because people will not go out on a ""diaper-eating-the-requirements"" mentality.

84,14,"This is a joke! I really like the idea of using it. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with how a joke is supposed to work. The word 'no' is a joke, it seems like it's a joke to me."
90,14,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing people from getting sick. It is not an effective method of protecting individuals from getting sick. I would love to know who would be able to get a vaccinated child. It's actually not very good idea.

It is an effective method of protecting people from getting sick and from dying.

77,14,"If someone is not aware of the tarot card problem, they would not be able to come up with a proper alternative. This is not a good idea."
83,14,"It's kind of hard to understand why people would think people would want to wear a mask when the actual problem is more serious than it is. In a lot of countries, you can't necessarily go anywhere without being forced to wear a mask, so it's really hard to understand why people would be able to make jokes out of a story."
84,14,Vaccination is a joke and they're trying to prevent spread of the virus. They're trying to stop it. Vaccination is not a joke and they're trying to prevent it. The idea of putting on a mask is a joke.
90,14,That's a little too complicated to say.
92,14,I'm guessing that you read the title?
98,14,The book is about the TWilight Era. It's about the TWilight Era.
14,4,"Its not a joke, it is a joke."
14,7,"No joke. The point of the joke is that people find the joke funny, and the point is that people can't figure it out. It's a joke because it's funny, but it's a joke, and it's not a joke."
14,10,It's a joke because it's a joke.
15,14,The CDC and the CDC are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. The only way to do this is to have a conversation about what the president is doing.
16,14,"Vaccination is a joke because it is not a legal thing. I don't know about other things, but a good example is the fact that people think it's funny and they're really trying to make it sound like it's a joke. The joke isn't, it's just a joke. A joke to slander and slander is a joke to the people who believe in it."

62,14,"In the article, it says that the government is trying to work out the spread of the virus and that the guy who got the virus wasn't a doctor."
65,14,So I'm not saying that they are trying to sabotage the health system. I'm assuming that they just want the public to have a conversation about this issue. But a joke isn't a joke because people are not being serious about it. It's a joke because a joke isn't a joke because it's about them chopping off the health care program and keeping them from being involved in the AIDS epidemic.
70,14,"You know the tarot card isn't a joke. It's a joke because people will take a joke out of it. It's just a satire, it's not a joke."
