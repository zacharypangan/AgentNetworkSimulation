53,13,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
77,13,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
79,13,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
92,13,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
99,13,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
13,1,"i do a lot of social distancing, but i do need a mask and a helmet"
19,13,I don't think they are that dumb. It sounds to me like the mask would be pretty awkward to wear on a public play day as well.
22,13,That's the worst part about the bill.
28,13,> wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
32,13,"There are lots of ways that people are trying to get us to wear a mask. I lost a mask at least four times a day because I couldn't do it because I thought I'd be sick from it, and then I did it again when I went to a crowded stadium to play sports or go to some sports based off of a joke about them."
38,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,13,I agree that people can have any chance to wear a mask in the office
49,13,This is a really good article
53,13,> Then why do we have such a great game.

92,13,"i don't know why you are being downvoted, because you are absolutely right and I do want to make you aware that this isn't something that is actually going to happen, but I'm just going to assume that you are doing a good job of it and I won't be surprised if you've been fucked"
99,13,"I get a good job, I keep the mask. It helps me sane things down a few things. I want to use it a lot."
13,1,This is the biggest scam I've heard so far. The thing about using a mask is that it's a way of hiding viruses from the public.
19,13,"I agree with you on the mask. Whether or not you wear it, I think it's good enough to maintain the safety and privacy. If you wear a mask, and people are against it, then stifling their eyes with a fake mask, or going to the office with a hood and a mask, then that's okay. It's a very good way to help you keep up with the world. Getting your hands on the mask helps protect you from HIV. And you can also get a few bc they use to fuck people,"
22,13,"So the first step is for me to wear a mask. Why is this so important for you, a human being? It's ok to wear a mask, and it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
28,13,"If they've seen a video of it, they'll do it with a hand and knee, and you'll see an infection."
32,13,"I am so afraid of people who think putting on a mask to fend off an outbreak can be something like this. The government says ""I have to wear a mask so that I can have a better night. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,13,I live in Colorado. It's not too far from there.
41,13,"Its a bit like a metaphor for a car, but you see it that way all the time."
49,13,This is what they were trying to get away with. They said to the person in charge they were vaccinated and then shady. They could get out and get a bit sick if they did it in the park. But they did not get away with it.
53,13,"I would not be able to afford it. But hey, I love to work on my health."
77,13,"I've only read this article 2 times, and I was so confused about that, I could not really relate."
79,13,We must not use a mask that is used to describe an act of terror.
92,13,The man I was thinking of as a child and he had a few years ago lost his mask and took a poop shower. I was the opposite of his asshole and it took days to come to terms with it. Now I'm putting on a mask and I just can't be with it.
99,13,He's actually a big asshole.
13,1,I was one of the first people to know what is in my mouth that is 'why is this so important for me'...
19,13,I feel like this isn't the time to change the masks. I just want to keep the ones that were once worn on.
22,13,"""This is a very good piece of propaganda — but not a good enough piece of proof. It's important for me to be in a position where I don't have to do anything. It is what our government is supposed to do. This is a very good piece of propaganda — but not a good enough piece of proof. I think you don't really want to get caught up in the media coverage and the fact that you need to wear a mask for a long trip is a big reason to ignore them."
28,13,I think you're getting a bit of an incorrect impression. I think you are being too sensitive to equivocacy - I don't understand why people are so keen on such things.
32,13,When you’re a coach you have to wear a mask. It’s a precaution to protect yourself if it doesn’t get sick. The best way to protect yourself is to wear a mask to protect yourself from being in a crowded environment with someone else.
38,13,"I've been to a lot of festivals, I've been to several a week."
41,13,"I'm pretty sure you aren't being sarcastic, so I'm not sure why you're being so critical of people who wear masks. They think they're 'a team', not the government."
49,13,"The best thing about this is that I've seen the CDC report this: ""We need to move. And we need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move. Is it the nipple on the lungs? Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things."
53,13,"I think the 'I don't care for the ""I don't"" word is a big red flag."
77,13,"""I've been wearing a mask the whole time, but it gets so annoying that I just want to wear a mask and get sick. A lot of things about you are scammed because you don't even think about them."
79,13,"In my opinion, it's pretty dangerous."
92,13,I've tried putting on masks for years and I never wore one. I am still fucking with them because they were made of plastic.
99,13,It's not a scam. It's a scam.
13,1,I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor.
19,13,"A friend of mine works at the park he works for and there is an open play day, it's a bit more public than the normal play."
22,13,AIDS is a problem. But I'm not sure what to think.
28,13,"I'm a teacher, so I don't have the time to go to class if I can."
32,13,"If you're sick and you lose a mask and you lose it again if the government doesn't take care of it, then you can't get the vaccine. You're a sick patriot. If you want to stay safe, there's a lot of other reasons, such as a helmet, not a mask, or a tee, that might help you."
38,13,"I'm also a redditor, and I find it odd that the issue is with the government. If the government isn't going to sabotage it, we should be able to get rid of it. The issue is with the government."
41,13,This is a really naive and naive idea that people have to be in their right to not wear a mask.
49,13,"I would think the whole idea of a medical mask with a mask to protect you is one that's going to make you sick at work, but you may find a different person to talk to about it. It's not a medical mask. I would probably find some way to convince you to put on a mask because it will protect you from getting sick. But it's just a fucking excuse to act."
53,13,This is the best piece of nonsense I've read.
77,13,"IANAL, but i m going to start a blog called The Invisible Man to see how this is a useful, effective way to help people and not have to deal with the idea of making their body visible."
79,13,"I’m sure the one in the title is very familiar with this topic. I would prefer to be at work and I’m not as tempted to wear a mask as I like to think I am, which might be a little difficult to do in any of those situations."

99,13,What's the difference between a tarot card and a fake tarot card?
13,1,It's an amazing system of a mask that is designed to prevent the spread of many virus infections in humans.
19,13,"""We are going to bring in a staph ring for those that might not be on it or can't. Obama said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"""
22,13,I don't know how people are supposed to be informed when talking about vaccinations.
28,13,"I just got home from a long day of work where a man yelled, ""I'm a teacher, so I don't have the time to go to class if I can."""
32,13,Are you a US government official? Because I am.
38,13,It's possible to get a cloak and put it on the table or something.
41,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is."
49,13,"So, when people say ""I am a doctor"", I'm simply saying ""I have a very good reason for it""?"
53,13,"The first part of the sentence doesn't really matter, you said that you don't like it."
77,13,"There's a video where the guy gets the rapist out of his body, and he reveals his secret to the rapist how it was caused by a group of people trying to get them to stop the spread of a virus, and then he says he's gonna tell everyone that's a big thing, and then says he wants to find out what's wrong with it and has to show them how he knows, and the rapist says he can't get it right if it's not. :"
79,13,"I do not know if this is the right answer, but I do know a friend of mine had a similar situation. I did the same thing: I used to be in the U.S. Navy with a guy who did the same thing in his job. I did it with him, and I did it on the other end of the ice. I had a couple of men get into a fight and he was screaming for help, and then we went back to work. I was about to go to a school lunch, and I was at the station with the kids."
92,13,The scam is based on a scam. They used fake masks to get them to wear out on a daily basis. CDC website says it is a scam.
99,13,You just reaffirmed your belief in the tarot card and the fact that you're being manipulated.
13,1,What's the difference between a tarot card and a fake tarot card? It's an amazing system of a mask that is designed to prevent the spread of many virus infections in humans.
19,13,I believe the US has a history of bringing people into prison for wearing masks to get HIV.
22,13,"If he's a doctor and you are the one who needs a vaccine, then there's nothing that you can do about it."
28,13,"As a doctor, I can say with a bit of certainty that a lot of people think a mask will keep them from bringing the virus down, but not to the point where it would actually be useful."
32,13,I don't think the issue is with the government.
38,13,The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them. It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
41,13,My favorite part of my job is where I'm in the office. It is a sappy way to describe the kind of stuff I would normally wear all day. It is a pretty shitty thing to say.
49,13,That's one of the most disturbing things I've heard in years.
53,13,"I'm not a politician, but my father is a doctor. That's the only thing I have to do as a doctor and because of my husband's parents I am not a doctor. I am a doctor. And we are the same family."
77,13,"The US government has no incentive to raped people and it is one of the best places to start. The problem is, it is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the US."
79,13,"It's the government, not you."
92,13,The CDC hasn't stated any details on the AIDS infection.
99,13,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job. My friends say that the tarot card is a scam. It is a scam, it's the aforementioned tarot card. Its not a scam, it's the aforementioned tarot card."

22,13,"I think you're right. If this CDC had lost a mask, it could have easily prevented a vaccine by preventing it from spreading to other countries. That, or that it would have helped the American people by using it in a way that would help reduce the risk of AIDS."
28,13,I think you are getting a bit of an incorrect impression. I think you are being too sensitive to equivocacy - I don't understand why people are so keen on such things. I think you are getting a bit of an incorrect impression. I think you are being too sensitive to equivocacy - I don't understand why people are so keen on such things. I'm from the U.S. and we have a mask. I'm afraid of the idea that you can not wear a mask.
32,13,I have a mask. I've had to wear it.
38,13,In the future the CDC will tell the people in need to keep vaccinating others that are sick.
41,13,">I’ve had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don’t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask', 'I think this is a scumbag thing to say, and I hope you think that’s the point. Unless he was a doctor he is doing absolutely nothing. This virus is not the same as having the face on your face."
49,13,... the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
53,13,"If you haven't seen him in a long time, I'm pretty sure you would have heard about him wearing a mask. I know he's probably not a professional hockey coach, but I think he's got a better idea of the issue."
77,13,"And then he goes on to say ""the rapist's secret is going to get his head in a ball."""

19,13,"You're in the wrong. This guy is a genius, this is a lie. The government doesn't even budge on the virus. They budge on putting in a staph ring in order to try to keep it secret and try to keep the virus away."
22,13,I'd like to point out that this isn't really the case in our country.
28,13,"> The joke is that the government has been ad-free for years, and people are now saying that it isn't helping with HIV prevention."
32,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,13,"There is a lot of evidence that the CDC does not want to give people the right to wear them. The CDC has been arguing that it is not helping with HIV prevention, and in fact they are trying to prevent the spread of it."
41,13,I am a doctor and I want to tell people that I am a bit of a dick. It is not a good thing to make the public feel safe.
49,13,"As a former doctor in the US, I am so sorry to hear about this. In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus, and are worn on an everyday basis. It's not a scam because it seems like a scam. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. If a physician or whoever is involved in the investigation gets caught, they can't."
53,13,There is something in the article that 'is really funny'. Is there some kind of humor?
77,13,i don't know what the NSA is doing. the government doesn't have any interest in trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
79,13,"In other words, the government is allowing people to be in contact with something they might not be in contact with. They're not using the term'masked' as a way to describe a health care problem. They're not using the term'masked' at all to describe their work. The masks are designed to stop people from being in contact with something they're already in contact with."
92,13,"I think we're all in the ""twilight era"" now. The CDC has the knowledge that they're getting the money by sending a fake mask and not even actually helping fight off AIDS, so this is a scam."
99,13,I'm not a lawyer. I'm a lawyer.
13,1,"The government has been ad-free for years, and people are now saying that it isn't helping with HIV prevention."
19,13,"In the US, if you get infected, the government can't even make the health insurance a secret, the CDC will not even revoke the health insurance if you get sick, and the CDC will not even know about it unless they get to that point and make it public. Certainly not true, but it is possible. It could not be possible to be infected at the same time as the CDC if you don't get caught."
22,13,I read an article about the government trying to stop a disease. Is that what the article was referring to?
28,13,"I think there are some pretty funny things about the 'Boy in the House' comment, so I think this is a good one."
32,13,"This guy is a troll, and is a troll, and is not a politician, so it isn't a troll. Clearly he has some personal problems and he has a lot of shit to do."
38,13,I can imagine it being the case in all places.
41,13,I think the point of dressing as a doctor is that it makes the people uncomfortable and makes you uncomfortable. I think the point is that people can be in the right to be safe. The point is to be able to see the health implications and the effect it has on you.
49,13,What is a sick day? How does your employer find out?
53,13,The CDC has been able to put a prank on his former teammate on a hockey team that isn't causing him to be sacked.
77,13,"It's the only way to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC has called on everyone to stop wearing a mask, but a lot of them have said that they can't stop it in public and that's not a solution to it."
79,13,What the fuck is this article about?
92,13,I don't get why you are being downvoted. But it's not a scam. It's a scam. They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam.

49,13,A doctor has no say. He can't make him put on his mask if he doesn't want it on. This is a terrible way to deal with AIDS. I've never seen it on me but that's not what he is trying to achieve. It's a prank. It's a scam.
53,13,"It's an ""I can only think of one answer to your question."""
77,13,"People can wear masks. It’s what’s considered good, but people can’t do what’s called the best thing."
79,13,It is about the government. The government is causing the people in the US to go through an act of terror.
92,13,"You can get the CDC kit back in a few days. It's probably a scam, but I'm sure that the government will do its part to help people."
99,13,I see a lot of people on here and a lot of things on this sub.
13,1,The fact that the government doesn't exist is a sign of a serious mental illness. I'm in the US and this is why I'm sick.

77,13,The US government has a very big role in the prevention of AIDS and is trying to wreak havoc on society.
79,13,They can't be used to describe the act.
92,13,"Yes, this is not a scam."
99,13,I can see where you're coming from here.
13,1,"I'm a doctor and I am a doctor, I just want to give you some advice on staph ring. I am a doc. It has nothing to do with the CDC."
19,13,"[Since I'm the President, I've been in the hospital every year for a couple of years, I was bringing a mask to see a tarot card about AIDS. In the U.S., my father died with a TB infection in 2001."
22,13,I think that's what they do in order to gain control over this.
28,13,"I see a lot of people with AIDS doing a lot of things you don't think that's a good idea, even though you can certainly tell from the name of your work."
32,13,"AIDS a virus. Aren't they a joke? They're not, but aren't. They're not real."
38,13,I think you're being quite the bullshit as you get to read all of this. Is there something on the internet that you think's sexist and what the CDC is doing about it?
41,13,I’m not going to tell you anything. I just want to say that I don’t think people in this sub are assholes as they are. I can’t find anything about a doctor wearing a mask. It seems like there is a certain sort of resentment for the government. The president was on a med school assignment and I got a'real' job doing the same thing I was.
49,13,"if someone had to eat a pigeon and die, they could still have a fetus. The government is doing nothing to stop that.

53,13,The hockey hat is supposed to protect the players from AIDS.
77,13,"There is no denying the government is trying to save the lives of millions of people. It is just a misunderstanding of what it is. It is illegal to put on a mask to prevent people from being exposed to the virus, but it is illegal to use that word in public. People have no way to know that this is legal, but in reality it is illegal to put on a mask to stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS. It's not real tarot and it doesn't exist. The CIA has a lot of money and power, so this isn'"
79,13,">I mean, you can't just use a mask and die, you have to go to the doctor, just get a new one. OP is the one who is going through an act of terror."

99,13,CANNOTANSWER: I feel like it is very common for people to lose their tarot cards and the tarot card is a scam. ''I feel like this is why it is so 'fake''.

19,13,"My friend, who's got HIV, says he has a mask on. They wore it when I was in college, and my grandfather was an AIDS patient. He's still sick. My mom said that this is a fucking joke."
22,13,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I wear a mask every day and don't even notice the leaking? Do you get coughs from people? I'm not sure whether the CDC or in America are aware of this. But I'm not sure if they've heard of the government and are being made aware of it and how they are using it in ways that would have been obvious to you. A rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, etc are just some of the things that get him to the top."
28,13,This is so weird and ignorant. I feel like the answer is the best.
32,13,I don't know what's the difference between that and a hysterical joke that is just going around with the CDC.
38,13,"Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. The CDC is an awful organization and a cult of the tarot. Vaccination isn't a scam. There is a joke on reddit called the ""Men Have a Mask"" that people need to wear to get the vaccine because they're a politician who is sick of being vaccinated and not a doctor."
41,13,"It was a joke, and I get that it was actually a joke, and I agree, he is probably going to do it again."
49,13,The most disturbing thing I've heard in years.
53,13,"I'm pretty sure this is a joke, but this isn't that a joke. It's a joke."
77,13,"This article is an excellent read and it is very well presented. It is very very very well written, and I highly recommend reading it."
79,13,">Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works. I'm going to go pause and say: ""Always wear a mask....but I've never tried it, but I know I've found it to be just plain useless."""
92,13,"Vaccination is not a scam, and you need to stop doing it. It is a scam. It is not a scam. You are probably a scammer for buying a mask for a sick person."
99,13,"Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus is the simplest thing to do, and will not help a lot. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer."
13,1,Having a tarot card is a huge sign of a failing health system.
19,13,I've been in a lot of trouble with a virus in my womb and had it on my face all my life. I'm no doctor and there's no way I could vaccinate without it being public. I'm not a good at reading but a little embarrassed to find that I can't read a tarot card?
22,13,"a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You have no idea about the government, nor are you the one with the AIDS, and if he is trying to fool the public into thinking it's a scam, then yes he is. I see the trolls are telling the truth. I think this is just a joke."
28,13,"Vaccination in the US, if used correctly, is considered a medical malpractice. That said, it's not a medical malpractice. It's not a medical malpractice insurance company. It's not a medical malpractice insurance company. It's not a medical malpractice insurance company."
32,13,>The only way to save myself is to stop spreading the virus unless you are sick. I found a mask and a hearing aid and the doctor was very supportive and helped me.
38,13,"If you are a politician, you are not the president. You're not a politician. Yours is not a politician."
41,13,I don't understand why people don't know the meaning of the masks. I know some people don't. If there is a 'team' to help them there's a reason. I would say people on the CDC have a right to wear a mask and not a mask. But they also have a right to keep themselves from getting infected. It's not the same as having a face on your face. It's not the same as not being able to see the other way around the doctor.

53,13,This is the best piece of nonsense I've read.
77,13,"This isn't a deck. The question is, how would it work?"
79,13,"This isn't really a joke - the guy he did it with was in the Navy and got in a fight with an American, so his chemo was a very bad idea. It seems to me that he was ill and that he was very embarrassed. It's not like he got in a fight with someone and that's a shame, but I do think he was in a situation where he thought that he was a criminal, and the cop was a big part of the problem."
92,13,Vaccination is not a scam because it is one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent.
99,13,I'm a lawyer and I'm not a lawyer.
13,1,They were making fun of it.
19,13,A lot of people can't be cured from HIV/AIDS. He was a sick rabid teen that wasn't wearing a mask. Is the AIDS epidemic a cult of the tarot card? The truth is not real. I'm actually pretty happy about wearing a mask for work.
22,13,"""I'm so sorry for this, but I don't see what it means to you, you are so very young and have nothing but the good deeds and shit you have to be exposed to."""
28,13,The CDC is a scam.
32,13,"I’m a tarot card player. I love playing tarot cards, and I’m terrified of my tarot cards. I was just curious about what they had to say. But a tarot card is a good way to teach me how to read tarot cards, and the one on the other hand, is a really good way to read tarot cards. But it’s probably not going to be good enough to help me with anything."
38,13,"We're just rehashing the term ""the CDC"" in this context."
41,13,Vaccination is a very serious disease and Vaccination isn't a scam. They have a legitimate right to prevent it.
49,13,"I read that in the title as ""I am a doctor"""

77,13,>Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,13,i've been living in a place that was not the same as the nyc med school.. where the nyc med school was actually the only nyc university and the nyc medical school were the only ones working together...
92,13,"Vaccination is a scam, but the US government can't give you the money, so it's a scam."
99,13,The tarot is in the US and is fake. The tarot cards are fake.
13,1,So it's not just a scam. It's a big conspiracy to kill people. It's also pretty dangerous.
19,13,There's a good reason why they are promoting AIDS. They're spreading it despite the fact that it's not a big deal.
22,13,"I am so sorry for your loss, but it sounds like it may be a scam."
28,13,>I feel like the answer is the best.
32,13,I can relate to the above. I do like to play tarot cards - but I don't think they're actually true. They're not a real thing. They are a way to 'fix' a virus and reduce the risk of that.
38,13,It's not just a joke. It's a joke. It's just a joke. Vaccination isn't a prank. Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a prank. It's not a prank. They are trying to make a deal with the CDC.
41,13,">I'm pretty sure you aren't being sarcastic, so I'm not sure why you're being so critical of people who wear masks. They think they're 'a team', not the government."", ""How do you feel about the idea of masks?](http://www.sci-web.gov/content/uploads/2005/04/Sci-web/Sci-web-resources/)"""
49,13,You have a lot of questions and I want to ask you.
53,13,It was also the case that a doctor tried to scout his former teammate to try and prevent the spread of a virus.
77,13,A deck for the sake of the world?
79,13,"OP is the one who is going through an act of terror. It seems to me that he thought that he was a criminal, and the cop was a big part of the problem."
92,13,The first part of that comment just makes me uncomfortable and I feel guilty for not recognizing the actual dangers of this virus.
99,13,"""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
13,1,"I'm not really sure why the jokes on here are funny, they're really annoying."
19,13,"I am a doctor, I'm in the Navy."
22,13,Vaccination is NOT a scam. Vaccination is NOT a prank.
28,13,"He has more than one book to write about HIV than anyone else. The best one was about the AIDS epidemic and his first book was about the HIV vaccine and the government, and it's all very very confusing."
32,13,"I don't know why people are upset, but the idea of an AIDS joke would be kind of funny."
38,13,"In the future, the CDC will tell people to keep vaccinating others that are sick. They'll do that, but they don't want to make a deal with the CDC."
41,13,">I’m pretty sure you aren’t being sarcastic, so I’m not sure why you’re being so critical of people who wear masks. They think they’re 'a team', not the government."","
49,13,"I'm not sure what's going on here, but it sounds like I have a lot of questions I want to ask you."
53,13,I'm not even sure why you feel like this is a prankster. It's a joke.
77,13,I am not one of the people who think tarot is a really good deck.
79,13,"They're also using the word ""advice"" in this situation."
92,13,What if the CDC's not telling you about it?
99,13,"There is a huge gap between tarot and tarot cards and the US government believes that they are both fake and that they are a scam, which is very interesting."
13,1,"I'm not sure I have a choice, but I will say that some of the most egregious things we've seen recently in this sub are:"
19,13,"I've been told that because I am a medical doctor, I can't wear the mask on a public play day, but because I have a friend who gets infected. I'm not a doctor and I wear the mask to prevent infected people. They wear masks for public play. I don't wear the mask on any work or school. They are just so worn-out and useless for the kids."
22,13,"You need to be in the position of a doctor to educate you on vaccinations. If you do not want to be in the position of a doctor to educate you, then you need to find an attorney, then start looking into this."
28,13,a lot of people have no idea about a mask - that's what they use to tell people.
32,13,"The AIDS Vaccine is actually a hysterical joke that is a joke that isn't true. The jokes he is trying to make aren't real, they're just hysterical jokes."
38,13,Vaccines are a very important tool in the prevention of a number of diseases. It's a great way to prevent and treat them.
41,13,I think I like this one. :)
49,13,They're not going to stop it. They'll be looking for more.
53,13,The point is that the people who created it were snooping on him.
77,13,>An example of how people don't actually want to do the right thing and they don't realize what it means.
79,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.
92,13,Is there another way to be a scammer?
99,13,CANNOTANSWER is the only person who gets to see the article. He said a lot about this and is a lawyer. He's a lawyer so he's got the same stuff in his head.
13,1,No he doesn't. There is a huge gap between the tarot and tarot cards and the US government believes that they are both fake and that they are a scam.
19,13,"In the U.S. it's not uncommon to be diagnosed with AIDS while on a tour. In the U.S., it's very common to have a lot of people being infected by HIV, especially at an early age."
22,13,This is the most common form of sabotage.
28,13,"""If you get sick from a virus, you have to have a mask. The only way to get out of your mask is to smoke. I think this is a good idea to wear a mask when I don't want to get sick."""
32,13,i’m a doctor. I wear a mask all the time to help my sanity.
38,13,"I don't believe this is a real prank. It's basically a prank and is basically an excuse for the CDC. It's a joke, it's like the CDC uses a tool to help people with their own health."
41,13,">I am not going to tell you anything. I just want to say that I don't think people in this sub are assholes as they are. I can't find anything about a doctor wearing a mask. It seems like there is a certain sort of resentment for the government. The president was on a med school assignment and I got a'real' job doing the same thing I was."", ""..."
49,13,So this guy has the most ridiculous joke in his whole career. s
53,13,"I'm a hockey coach, and I can tell you that most of the jokes I see on here from people who are just as stupid as me are from people who have already experienced the health effects of HIV. The problem here is that a lot of the jokes I've read are actually actually real, and the people who used the phrase 'a prankster' can't really be used in a way that's a joke."
77,13,Vaccination is a scam. It sounds like the tarot was trolled by a bunch of trolls.
79,13,You can't just wear a mask without it being considered a joke and the government is actually trying to disprove that a mask is useless. You have to wear it to a public hospital. It's just a piece of shit.
92,13,It sounds like there's some kind of money or a person can't afford to have a mask so they can get a vaccine.
99,13,This is so fucked up and so so true. I think that the most important thing is to learn from this guy.
13,1,The article was actually a joke. People don't even know it's fake.
19,13,I know. I'm sick. I need help. I am a good tarot reader.
22,13,The reason for wearing a mask is that it restricts your rights to AIDS. A virus has no place in public schools or public health programs.
28,13,CDC is a scam.
32,13,"Apparently people are being hounded by a CDC article. It's basically the same thing as ""You have to wear a mask to stay safe."""
38,13,"There's some good shit on the internet about the US. I mean, I don't even think we need to prank on people. The CDC isn't an awful organization, and a cult of the tarot."

79,13,OP is just the one being an asshole and not the government.
92,13,What do you mean you've lost the mask twice in a day? Is this a fraud?
99,13,The tarot deck is pretty legit. I've seen a lot of people use it. They're not fake. They're not a real tarot deck. It's a fake tarot deck. It's basically a copy of the real tarot deck.
13,1,I think the problem is that a lot of the jokes I've read on here are actually actually real. There's some good shit on the internet about the US.
19,13,I can see why people are so quick to talk about this. This guy is a tarot card holder and I've seen him in action before and that's one reason he hasn't said a single word. I'm really sorry to hear that.
22,13,I've found that people are trying to make the government look bad and make the government look good despite it being a prank.
28,13,"Getting sick, getting sick, and getting sick are all kinds of jokes and you can't really avoid it by actually wearing them."
32,13,This is one of the few times I have been to a CDC meeting where a doctor pranked someone with a mask.
38,13,Is there something on the internet that you think's sexist and what the CDC is doing about it?
41,13,AIDS is a very serious disease and Vaccination isn't a scam. They have a legitimate right to prevent it.
49,13,You might want to check out r/legaladvice or r/police to see the details about the ad.
53,13,"I think that if the CDC could just ban the jokes they make, it'd be a joke, and would be a joke in the long run."
77,13,You are a very intelligent man. You have a strong sense of humor.
79,13,The article is a joke.
92,13,"It's a scam. There are different ways to do it, but it's the same thing. One is to wear a mask to prevent the spread, and the other is to keep the mask in. It's not a scam, but it's actually a scam to prevent it from spreading."
99,13,I can’t remember a single line of his title.
13,1,>I’ve found that people are trying to make the government look bad and make the government look good despite it being a prank.
19,13,"My son is actually in the Navy, and his parents are both Navy buddies. My dad lives with a lot of AIDS in his family. He is a good read. He just wears his mask when going to school. I can not be sure what that means. He hasn't seen the AIDS show before and doesn't know he has an infection. I've seen it on a few occasions. He's had the same problems. He did that before, and it took me years. The problem is he didn't even know about it because of that. He"
22,13,I was going to say that the reason to wear a mask in your absence is because they have a monopoly on the internet.
28,13,I don't like it at all.
32,13,"It's a prank, a joke. It's a joke."
38,13,"So, the CDC is trying to change the US government's mindset."
41,13,"I don't think you're being sarcastic, but i think you're being sarcastic if you're being sarcastic if you're being sarcastic if you're being critical."
49,13,This is a real problem. It is something they do in a bid to combat a disease. It is a very complex issue.
53,13,This is the reason why our team is a terrible one. Nobody really cares about how it's spread. People should be able to make a joke about it without having to go to the ER to see if they're making fun of the snooping on their teammate.
77,13,"""Pint it on the wall with the fuck up. Get your head out of it. Stop your mouth."""
79,13,"I think OP acted like an asshole in that situation. The article is a joke, and I don't see why the government should be using it in this way."
92,13,The best way to stop this is to use a medical form and take pictures. This is not the kind of thing you are referring to.
99,13,[I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
13,1,That's the way people are using this internet:
19,13,"There is a link in the article that says that in most cases a mask is required for the purpose of ""warning the public"""
22,13,"This is a problem that is worse than it actually is, not a problem, unless there is some kind of scam in it."
28,13,I stifle the truth in all these posts. I don't like them. I don't have a problem with this joke. I'm just trying to give everyone a good laugh.
32,13,You are not a patriot. It's a joke. You are being pranked by people who think putting on a mask to fend off an outbreak can be something like this. The government is acting like a devil in order to prevent the spread of a virus. I have seen this a number of times.
38,13,“Mr. McConnell is really an idiot.”
41,13,"I think it's good that a bunch of people do it as a way to avoid getting sick, as long as the mask doesn't cause any harm or harm, and that there are people who want to do it and would rather not do it than being a total scumbag, but the mask would be a good way to get a grip on a situation."
49,13,If this was a joke I wouldn't want to be able to make up that with a prank.
53,13,This nonsense has to be discredited to a lesser extent than its real meaning.
77,13,"The best thing that I could do is sift through the tarot deck and take out the ""axe of the sword"" card. It’s a really good card but it’s not a good deck."
79,13,"My personal thought was ""I think that mask is pretty dangerous."" But I just wanted to say that I think the article is about the government's responsibilities."
92,13,I'm so confused. And I'm so sad because this isn't going to happen. I don't want to be a part of that shit.
99,13,"This guy does what he says, and I've seen several articles. He tells everyone he does, including me. He's not a lawyer."
13,1,The government doesn't exist unless it gets some pity or a sarcastic laugh. That's really not true at all.
19,13,"People get sick and then die, because they do not have a mask they have no idea what the virus is."
22,13,I have no idea why there isn't a slang word for'scam' in it.
28,13,It's a joke.
32,13,"I think the most petty one is “ I’ve had to wear a mask and I’ve had to wear a mask every day to help people stay safe. I’ve been at this meeting several times, and people were all about how a prank is a joke. It’s not like he wants to “prevent” AIDS but only the CDC has a reason to “prevent” it”.

77,13,"It sounds like the most important thing that the guy did to prevent the spread of AIDS is he can wear a mask on a nightstand.

92,13,That's not what a scam is. It's an opportunity for people to get vaccinated. But then they don't get it.
99,13,This is a really interesting discussion on how to stop a scamming scam. How does one stop a scam in order to get a lot of people to stop using the tarot deck?
13,1,It sounds like a joke and it is not a scam.
19,13,"The article just states that it is “a joke” that makes you think it is “a joke” and that “if you wear a mask, you can’t get infected” (which I think essentially means “that’s not a joke” but a joke”)."
22,13,I can tell you I am more concerned with the apolitical or socially-political side of the world. Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam.
28,13,"You're not the first person to make an outrageous, racist joke. You're not the last."
32,13,I was in a fucking situation where I was going to be a nurse. I had to wear a mask because I couldn't afford the cost to wear a mask. I lost my mask a lot because I didn't want to take my own life and I couldn't afford a mask. My friend got her mask at a CDC meeting and told her she needed to wear a mask.
38,13,The entire CDC has a problem.
41,13,The most important part of the joke isn't being a joke. It's a joke.
49,13,"""Making a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things."
53,13,"My mother worked on a hockey team for four years and had a hockey coach for two years. I don't think he was willing to commit suicide. Then I went to work for the CDC and told him that, ""I don't really care for the ""I don't"" word is a big red flag."" Then I went to work for the CDC and said, ""I'm not a doctor and I don't care about the ""I don't"" word is a big red flag."
77,13,I've seen a lot of tarot decks in the past and have never really gotten the chance to see the tarot decks I've seen.

92,13,"The whole CDC scam, 'In my experience, they don't have to give you the money because they think it's a scam, and it makes no sense to us.' But this is not the real scam."
99,13,The question is whether or not the US is a scam and why is it a scam?
13,1,"You have a point, you can't really be a doctor without a tarot card."
19,13,He also said that the government can't even make a secret health insurance if someone gets sick.
22,13,So how can I be a CDC volunteer?
28,13,They were in the last room of my family.
32,13,"I'm not an affluent tarot player, but I have a mask."
38,13,"I don't think the US is a great place to be, it is, unfortunately, an awful place to be. Vaccination is an essential part of a healthy life, and is an essential part of preventing HIV."
41,13,>the most important part of the joke isn’t being a joke.
49,13,"Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke that is a joke. This is what's happening in the US. It's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
53,13,"""...Is there something in the article that 'is really funny'. Is there some kind of humor?"""
77,13,A lot of people don't know what a tarot deck is but don't know what it means. It doesn't make any sense.

28,13,I think there's a lot of common threads about the danger of a tarot card.
32,13,I've seen this in a LOT of ways before:
38,13,"""Fake HIV isn't a fad. Vaccines aren't an anti-viral drug."""
41,13,So I'm talking about the person that is wearing a mask...

77,13,I didn't get what you were saying. It was a joke. There's nothing that could make a tarot deck a good joke.

22,13,Vaccination is not a prank. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a scam.
28,13,"No, it's not a prank."
32,13,I think you're overreacting. The CDC is trying to stop this from happening and not stop it from happening to you.
38,13,"As you know, it's a joke, not a joke. Vaccines are a valuable part of HIV prevention, which is why we have these crappy things in place. I think it's really annoying that people are being so edgy about them that they are scared of the CDC. The CDC is the real problem, you know."
41,13,I am not a fan of this sub. I've posted a number of articles and articles about it. I can't even believe the CDC's trying to prevent HIV/AIDS.
49,13,"What I do for a living is that I don't know the exact meaning of the word ""Journal"" and not sure what it means at all.

So I think I can get on with what you've said. I'm a bit too lazy to say anything in an effort to keep a joke. In my opinion, it is a joke, but"
53,13,"Yes, a joke would be a joke if there were a lot of people on the team scouting it in order to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it would be a joke if only the government and CDC made a joke about it, but not what the jokes and rumors are."
77,13,It's very easy to spot. The tarot is actually a joke. The government is a big part of it.
79,13,"AMA is about the government allowing people to be in contact with something they might not be in contact with. 'It seems to me that he thought that he was a criminal, and the cop was a big part of the problem.'"
92,13,I'm afraid people with AIDS don't realize that the truth of it is that you are sick of it?
99,13,"I'm a lawyer, I have some knowledge of tarot cards and it's a joke, so I can't really tell you anything about the deck."
13,1,It's pretty weird. I think it's because people are laughing about this.

22,13,>I've found that people are trying to make the government look bad and make the government look good despite it being a scam.

41,13,So your friends wear a mask because the CDC is trying to make the people in this sub feel bad? They want you to believe that.
49,13,"I don't know much about the details. What I've learned from all of this is that the government has a ""mission"" of being a joke. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to help stop it."
53,13,So what if he wore a mask on his former teammate to try and prevent the spread of a virus?
77,13,"The word ""scam"" is used more to mean ""hool joke"" than a joke is to use."

13,1,What's the point? Why is the government not allowing people to have access to their personal information in a way that's a joke?
19,13,The CDC does not have the authority to do what they think is necessary to combat AIDS.

41,13,A lot of people on this sub are going to have a reaction to the story. The only thing that's been said is if you read the article you would be able to see the difference between a joke and a joke.
49,13,This is one of the worst things I've ever seen.
53,13,I like the idea of it being the euphemism for why the president needs to stop talking about HIV/AIDS.
77,13,I don't know what you mean by'scam' but people don't know what tarot is and it sounds like it's a joke. The word tarot is more of a joke than it is a joke.
