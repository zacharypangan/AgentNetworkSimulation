In general, a person's mind can not detect a particular disease in their body. In general, a person's mind can not detect a particular disease in their body."
53,25,This is one of the reasons why I think the US government isn't giving a fuck about it and they haven't really figured it out yet. It's not going to get better either.
53,29,"I'm not going to be an expert, but this is very interesting. I'd read the whole article and see how it feels. It's like you're saying that people who aren't aware of the dangers of the virus, because it's an unprovoked fact, are not aware of the dangers in the human body. The entire article is filled with facts, which makes sense to me. It doesn't really mean anything."
53,31,"[Berlin Virus], the most notorious disease in human history."
53,34,So you don't like the idea of wearing a mask?
53,35,I'm not saying that a hockey coach is ineffective but that some of the players wearing masks could be a risk.
53,37,"I'm in the NHL, and I'm not in the NHL, but I play hockey on the weekends."
53,38,>But what about those pranks and rumors of the virus? Thats a good point.
53,44,That is exactly the kind of thing that a lot of people don't understand. That's a great question. I'd like to get a little help. I'm in a vaccinated state but the government has the same issue. I'm in a vaccinated state but the government has the same issue.

57,53,"I'm from Maryland, and I've never heard of this one. I thought it was the government having to get out the backdoor when my boss asked about it. Then he said ""hey, I see what you're saying, but what we're doing here isn't right. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't."
65,53,"OP, that is quite a common joke."
66,53,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
68,53,"It's actually pretty common for people to wear masks, but I would never wear a mask in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee."
74,53,I'm a hockey coach. But I'm a hockey coach and I haven't seen a hockey coach prank on anyone.
100,53,"The movie ""Blackout"" had a lot of similar songs that weren't particularly good."
53,1,It is really not a prank. I don't know much about the subject but it's just one part of it that is a lot of jokes and pranks in general.
53,6,"I don't know if it's a bad thing to have a mask on during a game, but it's not the same as putting on a mask when a player is going to be infected, or how to prevent it being spread."
53,7,"The thing about using a mask is that the person is infected, but in the course of life is responsible for what's happening. For instance, if a student or adult carries the Berliner Virus, and someone is infected with it, they are liable for a lot of problems. I mean, if you can't just scream it out and pretend it isn't happening, then you are very likely not going to get any more pranks."
53,8,>It's ok not to wear a mask. It's okay to wear it under a helmet. It's just a mask.
53,11,"Vaccination is a scam. It's the government. It's pretty common for people to wear masks, but I would never wear a mask in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee. The movie ""Blackout"" had a lot of similar songs that weren't particularly good."
53,13,"If you haven't seen him in a long time, I'm pretty sure you would have heard about him wearing a mask. I know he's probably not a professional hockey coach, but I think he's got a better idea of the issue."
53,16,"So how does the USA do that? It's a good question, but what is your opinion on the issue?"
53,17,"Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. Regardless, I would resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."
53,20,It's pretty common for people to wear masks in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee.
53,23,This is a good point.
53,25,Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. It's pretty common for people to wear masks.
53,29,Is the government going to put on the mask to prevent a virus? I can't think of a better way to say that.
53,31,I was in the NHL and went through the same thing. One of my colleagues told me that the guys were gonna be a dick in the ass and he resigned. He said that they would tell me the truth to get back in shape.
53,34,"It was really good talking to you. Your coach, for example, is an idiot. Your doctor is the only one who's ever actually done anything, and they are trying to prevent this from happening to anyone in the country."
53,35,I think I was just wondering about what the article is saying - 'you have to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?'?
53,37,I think the point of the article is to try to figure out why some of the players are wearing masks and I'd rather not wear one.
53,38,"Why are people ignoring the issues and complaining that it's a problem for us? Because when I go to the gym or the gym I always have a pair of gloves and a pair of eye contact gloves, and they can prevent people from talking to me. The best part is the fact that the mask is not necessary to prevent people from saying ""I can't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."""
53,44,"I think you are right, ""we can't have the right of people to put on a mask in a safe and professional setting"" and then say ""This is going to get worse""."
53,47,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. It's actually pretty simple.
53,49,"Then he said ""hey, I see what you're saying, but what we're doing here isn't right. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate.

I think that's a good thing to be doing for all of the CDC's purposes, and a nice, big, and safe thing for people who need one, if not the other, and a nice way for them to spread the word about AIDS. I think you're overthinking it a bit because there is just so much fake stuff that's not a good thing to do."
65,53,"... I want to have a doctor, but it just isn't."
66,53,"The only way to stop a sick person from dying is to have it taken out, preferably from your family. That's not a joke."
68,53,"I am a very poor man, but I don't have any friends with AIDS (my grandmother is from Vietnam, so I don't think it is possible that she has AIDS, it would be more of an emergency situation to call on my parents to see if they are able to help me). I don't believe I've ever had a nightmare about my life. I would do whatever my dad or I might. I would go to work, I would get sick, and I'd have to walk to the hospital if they were able to do. I'm not"
74,53,I’m still wondering why this is relevant.
100,53,"This is a good point, the lyrics are fucking horrible, the lyrics don't even go to slack."

53,7,"""We have to take steps to prevent these types of accidents, including getting a vaccinated athlete into contact with a virus."
53,8,"Vaccination is the best part of the sport, despite what most of the commentators suggest. A good thing if the government is responsible, then it can help prevent AIDS epidemics by providing masks to players, especially since you're a healthy person in the US."
53,11,"I'd just like to say, that ""The mask is kind of like a kind of virus. It's a kind of a kind of mask that protects the players from all the flies you're infected with, which is actually what it's supposed to protect."""
53,13,There is something in the article that 'is really funny'. Is there some kind of humor?
53,16,I would have to say that you're not a hockey coach.
53,17,I think there's a lot of falsehoods.
53,20,"I think the best part is the fact that the mask is not necessary to prevent people from saying ""I can't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."""
53,23,"Vaccination isn't an anti-vaccination drug. It isn't an anti-viral drug. Vaccination isn't a prevention drug. The CDC has already tried to prevent the spread of AIDS, and they've had success with it. The article has little to nothing to do with AIDS."
53,25,"A lot of the people I know are in the military. So, yes, if a coach said a teammate did not wear a mask to protect them from the virus and instead got sick, he would resign."
53,29,I can't help but feel that your sarcastic comment is misplaced and misunderstood based on the fact that you know the truth.
53,31,I'm going to take this one seriously.
53,34,"It's not the mask or the helmet that's supposed to protect them, but the way they are supposed to protect a team from viruses. Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government. It's not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't."
53,35,"Vaccination isn't a scam, it's the government."
53,37,It sounds like a really stupid thing.
53,38,"I've been at the office of one of the CDC's employees. They have had a prank called ""I was too bloated to shit"" and that's how it works in many instances. So I guess the CDC is just trying to protect people. Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination isn't a scam."
53,44,"So basically ""a mask is supposed to protect the players from a virus. A dick in the ass is just that.. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus.

A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus."
53,47,This is a great point! We need more people like you.
53,49,A team that was infected with the flies and a mask is really all the best.
57,53,This guy is just a dick. The CDC are taking it to their level?
65,53,"So, I can only think of one answer to your question:"
66,53,"In a nutshell, the CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people - from people infected with HIV/AIDS (infected by a virus that is more prevalent than HIV/AIDS)."
68,53,"Nope. The fact that you can’t walk is probably part of it, and I’m sure that’s not exactly true."

53,8,">You're going to need to talk to a nhlvs head coach who can't work out the problems that come with wearing a mask."""
53,11,I'm surprised that the article has nothing to do with AIDS.

53,44,Because a mask is supposed to protect the players from HIV.
53,47,The president has been effected by this and should be able to talk with the president about it as much as possible. That isn't a joke. It's a legitimate concern.

53,11,"A lot of the people that make a mockery of the US government are either just plain dumb assholes or people that get a csi/hsi. I mean, that's why they didn't like it."

53,38,I'd have to start by saying to someone on the sub that the whole thing is a joke.
53,44,I'm pretty sure there are no signs that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government.
53,47,This isn't a joke. It's a satire about people who haven't been doing a real deal with it.
53,49,I've been watching a few different AIDS stories. I'm sure they are not a lot of fun to watch but I don't think they have any real facts.

100,53,...[T]he government is bringing up the problem.
53,1,It's kind of funny that there's no such thing as a vaccination. Its just a scam. I'm guessing a lot of people think this is what the US government does. And it sounds like it's been putting on a lot of pranks.

53,7,"Vaccination is an antiviral drug, but not an anti-viral drug."

53,6,I think the joke is a joke.
53,7,"Vaccine is not an anti-viral drug. But if you are infected with HIV, then the person you are infected with is liable. And if you are infected with HIV, then the person is liable for whatever happened. That's the issue - there is no real way to stop a virus, but people do the right thing with the right tools."
53,8,There is no joke in the story.

53,17,"I don't know where you are coming from, but the CDC is responsible for vaccinations, and the only way to prevent HIV/AIDS in a public place is through proper helmets and a mask. There's no reason to be concerned if a person gets vaccinated."
53,20,You need a doctor to diagnose an AIDS diagnosis.
53,23,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. A joke, and it's not a joke."
53,25,A prankster is not a joke. They are trying to make it a joke. The article argues that 'I love hockey' and he wears a hat as a joke.

53,1,I'd bet the government is working harder to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
53,6,I am a hockey coach. I love this stuff. The truth is that they are trying to make it a joke because they need to stop the spread. So it is a prank.

53,13,"I think that if the CDC could just ban the jokes they make, it'd be a joke, and would be a joke in the long run."
53,16,I had a friend who was a hockey coach and the guy asked him to wear a mask because he thought he wasn't doing well. I never got a response.
53,17,"I've always thought the only reason the government can ban AIDS is because it is an AIDS outbreak, which is the result of a vaccine being used on people. Unless you've been to the CDC and they supposedly have no mandate, I don't see why any of this is a joke."

53,37,"I would get vaccinated if I had it. I'd be worried about a AIDS patient who can't get it in the system. I'd still resign, because that is the last thing on my mind."
53,38,That's a prank.
53,44,Vaccination is not the answer to all the deadly disease epidemic in America. It’s a joke.
53,47,"A hockey coach has been wearing a mask for several years, but he hasn't been able to make the decision to do so. There are so many things that a doctor could do to protect players from being infected, I think he needs to put it on."
53,49,"Then he said ""hey, I see what you're saying, but what we're doing here isn't right. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't."
57,53,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because it has nothing to do with what the government does.
65,53,"'What are you saying? I'm gonna lie, I mean, you can get a mask and if you're not a doctor if you're still sick, you don't need to get vaccinated, if you're not.'"

53,13,This is the reason why our team is a terrible one. Nobody really cares about how it's spread. People should be able to make a joke about it without having to go to the ER to see if they're making fun of the snooping on their teammate.

If you're talking to someone with a mask, you have to be honest with them. It's going to be a joke."

65,53,Alot of people believe the government is trying to make people feel better. It is a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern.
66,53,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a scam. It's a scam because it's illegal because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.

53,13,He said it was a joke because there is so much more to the joke than just one word. I’m just saying that he was being a bit of a troll.

53,25,I'm assuming he's making fun of a guy because he's an employee?
53,29,There is nothing the government can do to prevent the spread of AIDS. It has nothing to do with the CDC. They are also essentially trying to hide a bunch of facts and information about the vaccines. They will try to prevent the spread of AIDS. There isn't really anything the government can do.
53,31,"I'm not sure if this is a joke, but I think the CDC would do something about it. They aren't making fun of a vaccine, but they are trying to give people information about it."
53,34,Is this a joke? No?
53,35,"The idea is to make people laugh when they can tell a joke about something that fucked them up. But as soon as a guy says 'I love hockey, and I wear a hat', he will begin to laugh because he knows he's being pranked. But if he thinks that's a joke he may not be going to keep them laughing. But if he's going to keep them from playing, he might not avert anything he could say 'I don't think this is a joke"

53,44,"“What's a joke” is just a joke referring to the health and health risks associated with vaccination. And not a joke to try and convince you that this is a joke or a joke. If that makes you feel any better, we will find a new way to express our opinions on the issue. I’m not going to go on any further than that."
53,47,The question was: I'm trying to prevent it from spreading. It's the problem.
53,49,Vaccination is a joke because it does not affect the spread of the virus. It's just an elaborate way to get people to get involved.

66,53,And the fact that this is a joke reflects that it's a joke. The government has no control over how people use the word.
68,53,The whole thing is a joke.
74,53,I think it's funny that the President wears a mask as part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of AIDS. The guy is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. That is a joke.

53,7,Vaccination isn't an anti-viral drug.
53,8,I think he is being sarcastic...
53,11,"Yes, you're in trouble. But that's all nonsense. You can stop it."
53,13,Because it seems that the President of the United States is a man. They are trying to get people on the team to stop the spread of AIDS. They are trying to prevent the spread. So that is a joke.
53,16,I'm trying to understand the concept behind why he wants to get a vaccine. But he's going to get a medicine. But he's going to see a doctor. What is the difference between a doctor and a hockey coach? Is he saying he wants to make a joke about the fact that he thinks he's being pranked?
53,17,Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is trying to make the public aware of the AIDS epidemic. The article says that the government and the government have no jurisdiction over the spread of HIV/AIDS.
53,20,That's why I don't want to go to the CDC.

53,20,"Vaccination is a joke, but it doesn't have legal authority over a virus. It doesn't have legal authority over a virus. It's a joke because it has a legal obligation over a virus. That's why people wear a mask if they're not vaccinated because of it's anti-viral and not because they're a joke."
53,23,"The fact that vaccines don’t affect the spread of viruses is another matter. It’s a joke because they are considered a vaccine. And, that's why they don’t use them to treat a virus."
53,25,"I mean, that's a joke because the joke was about a government employee and not the President."
53,29,"If you have been there, they aren't really the kind of people who want the president to make fun of, and I hope to help."
53,31,I don't know what to say. I do not mean to insult the government. I mean that the CDC is going to put out a LOT of bad advice.
53,34,It's not a joke because it's anti-viral drug. It's a joke because it's an anti-viral drug.
53,35,"CANNOTANSWER: I’m just trying to make you laugh, but I don’t want to be asked."
53,37,Because a government employee wants to create a dangerous environment. That's why I wouldn't wear a mask. Vaccination isn't an anti-viral drug. And it doesn't have any legal obligation to prevent it from spreading in the US.
53,38,I can't even understand why the CDC is not required to wear hats. It just doesn't work in a very normal job.
53,44,"And if you get it a few days later, he is going to try to convince him to stop and reevaluate it."
53,47,"A hockey coach is just trying to get the president to a point he is not going to take seriously, and as a result, is trying to get the president to be able to discuss this. He's not trying to make the president look cool."
53,49,"The first part of the whole thing, and everything I've seen here, is pretty much what I thought the person was thinking - a prank about the CDC and a joke about the President."
57,53,"The CDC has said they are able to do that on their own initiative and is able to do it on a voluntary basis, and they are unable to do so by force, as this was an attempt to do. They have a policy of ""eventual vaccinating"". There is a problem, though, with the government focusing on doing so in a way that isn't a joke."

66,53,It's a scam because it's illegal because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
68,53,"I am sorry, but that's my last name. [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME"
74,53,I don’t think this would go well with the 'A hockey coach is wearing a hat and a hockey mask to prevent the spread of AIDS'.
100,53,"I'm a doctor and I've always liked this song (I have it and it was an excellent joke) and I can't stand this one. I don't see it as a joke or anything like that. I think the lyrics to it are really sad and it's a little off-putting, but it's just really not a good joke. AIDS is not a joke. It's a joke and it isn't funny, and it doesn't work. But I don't know what to think of the song."
53,1,This isn't about preventing the spread of HIV. It's about the fact that the U.S. government is working to prevent it.
53,6,AIDS is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke. A joke is a joke because it has no legal obligation to cure the virus.
53,7,I'd tell the President that the joke about being infected with a virus is a joke.
53,8,"No, it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke, and it's a joke because it's not a joke, because it's a joke because it's a joke. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases."
53,11,It's a joke that does not have any legal authority over vaccines.
53,13,"I think I can understand that the article isn't about ""the joke"", but instead about the people trying to convince the president to stop talking about AIDS."
53,16,The truth is that they are trying to stop AIDS from spreading. The law that protects against it is anti-viral and they are trying to get rid of the epidemic by putting on a mask is one that has become popular.
53,17,That's a joke. No prank is a joke. That's a joke.
53,20,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't have legal authority over a virus. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases.
53,23,It is a joke because it doesn't affect the spread of HIV/AIDS and it has no legal obligation to treat it.
53,25,I believe that a lot of the people who know are in the military.
53,29,CANNOTANSWER: I’ve seen this shit a lot and I don’t see why the article is so disturbing. The entire article is filled with facts.
53,31,And so here's the thing about the US government:
53,34,Vaccination is a joke because it has no legal obligation to treat the virus. It’s a joke because it’s an anti-viral drug.
53,35,What a bunch of people are trying to get.
53,37,The joke is about the CDC putting a 'hoax' on a vaccine. They can do that in an effort to 'change the law' and that's what it's about.

53,11,"There's a good chance the CDC is trying to get rid of AIDS by putting on a mask to protect players, but it's not likely."
53,13,Vaccination is illegal because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent the spreading of the spread.

53,38,You want me to get in on the jokes for you.
53,44,"The article is just a joke about the CDC putting the dick in the ass on a vaccine. It isn't a joke. It's not an anti-viral drug. They can't use it to cure other diseases. The article has little to nothing to do with it. They can't use it to cure other diseases, and that’s why they don’t even call it a vaccine."
53,47,It is a joke because it is supposed to prevent the spread of the virus.
53,49,The guy who posted the article was the one who told us he was 'a prankster' and is an asshole. He's putting a prank on the government because he 'needs' to know about the AIDS epidemic.
57,53,"""This is not a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does."""
65,53,Vaccination is a serious and common issue. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern.
66,53,I'm a doctor and I have a phobia of flying flies.
68,53,"""Isn't it a joke?"""

53,17,"So we see this as a joke, or something."

53,29,"The article is a prank, so they might see that this is the'spot on' situation."
53,31,I don't think a prank is going to stop the spread of AIDS. The issue is whether or not it is going to stop AIDS from spread in the USA. And whether or not it is going to stop the spread of AIDS.
53,34,"He just wants a vaccine to stop that virus and he wants to go and get it. Not just to 'defeat' the CDC, he wants it to be banned from his country as well. It isn't a joke."
