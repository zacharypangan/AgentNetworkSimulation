92,66,"I had a job with a ten foot stretcher, so I got a good job in the first place. I had a friend who had a long sleeved vest at the time so she wouldn't look down and look at me like I had to stand next to him and go to work."
92,71,He didn't say anything about his mask.
92,76,a lot of people lose their masks at least every day.
92,78,It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam.

92,13,The man I was thinking of as a child and he had a few years ago lost his mask and took a poop shower. I was the opposite of his asshole and it took days to come to terms with it. Now I'm putting on a mask and I just can't be with it.
92,14,"In the US, in order to wear a mask, you have to be in a situation where you're wearing a mask to protect yourself. You lose a mask at least once a day and are allowed to get a new one, even if it's for a relatively short period of time. If you have a mask and are going to be sick and in an emergency, you must have been sick for a long time."

92,34,I have a relapse mask. I've been using it a lot for the past year and I'm still fucking with it.
92,35,I lost a mask because of a cold so I wore one every day for a while. I was never a good person but I lost a lot of shirts because of a cold because my hands were covered in all sorts of skin. The masks are made of plastic and thats why I lost a couple of pairs. My masks were made of polyurethane. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest.
92,36,"My friends and I had to buy a mask, but I still lost it because they thought it would be a scam."
92,42,I've lied to people all the time. It's the best kind of deception.
92,43,That is pretty naive. My best friend lost her mask after going out of the door without it. She had never even met her husband before. She's been in her early 30s and he's got a lot of stuff in her hands. She even said that the only thing that he does when she's in the hospital is to put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt. She doesn't want to go through the restaraunt with it. She was just looking to get it to the hospital. The mask isn't a scam
92,51,It was a scam. But it is really a scam. I lost my mask because of it.
92,52,"I lost my mask, my wife's mother's wallet, and my house, so I got my own mask, and I lost my wallet for my mom."
92,55,I lose a mask because I lose my wallet.
92,57,So you lost a mask a year ago? I think it was a scam to have a friend who lost her mask because it was not his AIDS kit and you were still on your AIDS kit?
92,64,I'm so sorry for your loss.
92,66,I think I lost my mask in that first episode. I felt terrible. Then I felt like I lost my wallet. I was scared and just realized I lost it!
92,71,I have a fibromyalgia. I go a lot 'no'when I don't wear a mask. My face always seems to get in the way. The first time I went to a doctor for a virus I got in a freakin'pneumonia.
92,76,"Honestly, if you can't afford it, you'd be a scam if you don't have the money."

92,80,I feel like I lost my mask and then my purse because I'm afraid I'm going to be tripped up by it.
92,81,"I have been doing this for many years. The only thing I remember about my friends is that I always went back to work with the idea of having to put on my mask for the sake of looking smart, so I just did it again. I lost them all because it was so hard for them to get out of their homes with them."
92,82,You're the only one who is convinced it isn't a scam. Probably only one of the three people I know who lost their mask to the IRS.

92,13,I've tried putting on masks for years and I never wore one. I am still fucking with them because they were made of plastic.
92,14,"So, if I lose a mask, I go back to work with the same idea. I wear a mask four times a day, then take a relapse mask, then leave and smack my head at the hospital. It’s a scam. I lose a mask because I’m not doing anything. And it’s the relapse masks."
92,16,I had to go back to work to have my own mask. I just had a relapse.
92,31,"I'm sorry you were in a similar situation. I've lost my AIDS kit and my wallet at least once, it still feels like the same kind of stuff I lost."
92,34,So... he lied?
92,35,I lost my mask on my'mug.' This is not a scam.
92,36,"I mean, I know there's some money on that, but it's a real thing."
92,42,That's the kind of thing I don't think I ever really remember.
92,43,"It was a scam, but I believe the CDC said they have an actual health evaluation that tells them to go back on the prescription."
92,51,"I’m sorry, this has happened to you. You lost your mask?"
92,52,Do you think that's the joke? That's basically the same as what's happening.

92,57,"Yes, the AIDS kit is still there. They are getting used to wearing the mask, a lot, but it is a lot harder to get it back. I've got to get it back and it's very difficult if I don't wear it. I just get too lazy and not really get it back."

92,76,"What do you mean ""put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt""?"
92,78,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things before.
92,80,"I was actually on a long journey to get a good fit, and found a good AIDS med that worked for me. It's an incredible piece of work and I stayed there with it for almost a year. The doctor said it was a scam but if it was the same way, it wasn't a scam."
92,81,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,82,I see that you are not the only one who is convinced it isn't a scam.
92,88,It's a really complicated thing to learn.
98,92,I've done a lot of dumb things before.
92,2,"AIDS is not a thing. Rather, it's a disease and it can't be removed or treated unless you have a mask. This isn't the same as taking an AIDS med. It has nothing to do with being a man."

92,16,"I'm going to be the first to admit that I have a very bad memory about this. It's interesting to note that in the US, there's no way a medical doctor will give me that kind of information. But there is nothing that I can say to explain it. There are also places in the U.S. where the CDC is unsure."

92,34,I lost my mask on a mug because I forgot about it when I was an adult. I can't even remember how long ago I lost the mask. I have been removing it and the CDC says that it's not a scam.

You can find some of them on Amazon. They are usually good for those who can pay the cost, but sometimes they are just not worth it."

92,80,Vaccination is not a fraud and the people who do it are being told that. It's not that hard to do.
92,81,AIDS is one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent.
92,82,I think you have a problem with that. The doctor who said it was a scam could have a good reason to not give his insurance and had the best answer: he is a scamster.
92,88,They are all scams. They're not fools.
98,92,It's one of the stupidest things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
92,2,There's a website for AIDS prevention. Check the link: http://www.cbr.org/cbr-us/hr-info.html
92,13,The scam is based on a scam. They used fake masks to get them to wear out on a daily basis. CDC website says it is a scam.
92,14,"I think the only thing I can say is ""No"" because there is no way for the government to go after someone for ""unwanted assistance"" to be considered a good sign. Unless you are a public health official, you don't know much about this."

92,71,"A friend of mine recently lost her nose a lot and lost her mouth a lot - at least once a day. The doctor told me not to do it but not to wear the masks. Luckily, she didn't know what she was doing or to do it as it was an expensive operation, so she did it."
92,76,[Kids can be a lot smarter than that](https://www.reddit.com/r/hr/rr/hr-info.html)
92,78,Is there a fake mask? I'm not sure.
92,80,That's an AIDS scam. I figured I'd just ignore it because I figured it was a scam and I would only ever wear it for a few days.
92,81,I lost the AIDS kit and wallet at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
92,82,AIDS is a very different type of illness than most other illnesses. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor.
92,88,It’s like saying “I woke up a bit late to the party” for me...
98,92,"So, you're not just reading ""putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."
92,2,It is a scam and is a part of the AIDS response. The doctor told her to keep the mask and get her medically ready to make a doctor come. It has nothing to do with being a man.
92,13,The CDC hasn't stated any details on the AIDS infection.
92,14,And yet you are being called an idiot for not being smart.
92,16,"I like the word ""scam"" a lot. I think it's an interesting thing about the CDC and how it's not a scam."
92,31,I don't think you're going to be able to tell a CDC doctor that a mask is a scam. It's a simple fact that it's part of an anti-cancer protocol.
92,34,"There's a lot of misconceptions that can be made about being sick, but it's not really a scam."
92,35,CDC: Vaccination is not a scam. AIDS is a very different type of illness than most other illnesses. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor.
92,36,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I lost my AIDS kit and my wallet at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
92,42,I've been going to the CDC since I was a child and it seems to me that these are two very important aspects of vaccination. I've seen them in my family but nothing like that.
92,43,"I don't understand why people think that this is a scam. I was told by my family that you can't fake the fact that you've lost a mask because you didn't know it existed. I'm not going to go into detail, but I don't think this is a scam, but I will take the opportunity to point out that it is a scam."
92,51,It's definitely a scam. This is just an ad.
92,52,"In all seriousness, the CDC is not saying that this is a scam, because it tries to convince people to do it in the first place. It's just that it is a scam. I'm sorry if anyone got hurt in this but the CDC is wrong. The truth is that this is an AIDS scam. I think it is, but I'm not sure it's what it is."
92,55,"The CDC was wrong. The AIDS kits were not used in your location. You can see a bunch of the virus's blood flowing out to your eyes and mouth, but a fake mask is the only way to get rid of it. That's a scam, not a scam. I would suggest contacting the CDC and trying to find a doctor to do an AIDS-preventative."
92,57,"I think it’s a good idea to post that in your own post. Having the money is a big deal here, and a good thing they don’t have to sell the masks, they can sell the drugs, they aren’t cheap, they’re in the form of a scam, and they get the money by selling the masks."
92,64,I lost my AIDS kit and wallet in my teenage years. The CDC was not the first to inform me that they had the money.
92,66,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam.
92,71,"The CDC is also helping prevent some types of HIV infections, which can lead to other types of illness like pneumonia."

92,78,I just want to be clear:
92,80,It's not a scam because AIDS is a really serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
92,81,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. It's not.
92,82,Vaccination is not a scam. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. I think you have a problem with that.
92,88,"I think the point of this post is because a lot of the people who do this have no idea what they're talking about. You should look into what this CDC says about AIDS and not just how long it takes for the doctors to come back and replace it. It's not a scam, it's a scam. It's the type of thing people in medicine are willing to do and have no evidence, which is not how most people do it."

92,36,The masks are a scam. The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
92,42,What's going on here? There's some pretty obvious stuff going on here that you need to have been informed about. The CDC has an actual health evaluation that tells them to go back on the prescription. This is a scam.
92,43,I'm not sure what you're talking about.
92,51,"I have to admit, I’m not going to take it seriously. I’ve only been vaccinated and had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
92,52,The CDC is not saying this is a scam. It’s just that it’s a scam.
92,55,The truth is the CDC says that the AIDS kit and wallet are a scam. It is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. AIDS is not a scam.
92,57,You don't think the FDA is taking them to their level?
92,64,"I think that's a legitimate reason. I mean, I'm really sorry, but I don't understand why people think this is a scam."
92,66,You're not talking about a scam. It's about a a scam.
92,71,"This is probably the one of the many medical scams that I would be able to stop. I'm gonna give you the shit but I can't just say what I can't do. But, if you're going to do something with this money you have to go with it, and not with the CDC."
92,76,"People, especially those who aren't interested in the CDC and the health care system, do not trust the CDC to do their own research or provide information about HIV. It's also common misconception that this kind of thing is wrong."
92,78,I don't see any scams in this post.
92,80,Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. It's not a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is wrong.
92,81,"I don't see how there is any legal reason to do this. Unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
92,82,I think the problem is with the fact that the CDC is making such a sweeping public declaration that it is scam.
92,88,So it's a scam. It's a scam. A good thing. It's a scam. It's a scam.
98,92,"""I am in the twilight era?"""
92,2,"The CDC is taking them to their level. I don't think this is a scam, but rather a scam that is not allowed to be proven to be a real scam."
92,13,"I think we're all in the ""twilight era"" now. The CDC has the knowledge that they're getting the money by sending a fake mask and not even actually helping fight off AIDS, so this is a scam."
92,14,Vaccination is a scam if the CDC uses fake masks. You supposedly get to pick up the virus from your own hands while you work in the hospital.
92,16,"In the US, there's no way a medical doctor will give you that kind of information."
92,31,"""I am in the twilight era?"
92,34,This is definitely a scam.
92,35,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because you get HIV and it's an HIV and HIV isn't a scam. Vaccination is not a scam because it's a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor."
92,36,This is a scam. It's a scam.
92,42,"A very old story is that an AIDS victim gets to stay a lot longer than they did when they were alive, but the truth is it's a scam. I'm sorry, but I have been in this situation. I've only been vaccinated and had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
92,43,> The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
92,51,"I've been vaccinated at least three times. But this is the first time in the history of the CDC. I would love to know what happens to that mask. Then, I'll say, ""Have you been vaccinated yet?"""
92,52,It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.
92,55,They're not even gonna get your money back because they're going to have to pay you back. They're going to have to pay for your money back and pay the CDC to get it back if you don't want to.
92,57,"If you lose a mask over a year, you can go to a clinic and have the money returned, and the hospital will make a payment for the medical bills. If you lose a mask a year later, you can get the money back because you've been vaccinated and not been vaccinated. So if it's a scam, you're a scammer."
92,64,You want to stop that kind of scam?
92,66,CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses. They need to make the masks available for the general public to purchase and do the research.
92,71,He's right... It's a scam. The CDC is wrong.
92,76,They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam. They are going to put in a lot of effort.
92,78,I like to think people think that this is an interesting post. You're a fucking ape.
92,80,They are the only ones that don't do that
92,81,i am in the twilight era and i have been going back to work with the idea of having to put on my mask for the sake of looking smart
92,82,Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
92,88,"I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm not gonna lie to you. Is there an actual science to prove that the CDC can't test it and they don't actually do it?"
98,92,This is the truth. I do not see a difference.
92,2,If you haven't vaccinated yourself you're a scammer.
92,13,I don't get why you are being downvoted. But it's not a scam. It's a scam. They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam.
92,14,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because they want to give money to people who aren't vaccinated."
92,16,"Vaccination is not a scam, it is because it is a serious illness. You need to get a vaccine for it, and get the money back. If you lose the mask, and get the money back, you are a scammer."
92,31,Is there a science to prove that the CDC can't test it and they don't actually do it?
92,34,You're not going to get the AIDS kit back if you don't get vaccinated. It's a scam.
92,35,I am so sorry i was able to lose my mask at the beginning of this post.
92,36,"There is a good deal of money on that stuff, but you don't need a good doctor to come with it."
92,42,"Vaccination is a serious illness and you can be vaccinated with or without it. If you are going to get it, you can get it from the doctor and get the money back if you aren't vaccinated."
92,43,It's not a scam. The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is not a scam because it's a serious illness unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
92,51,The government must act accordingly. There is no such thing as a real medicine.
92,52,"I can understand why people are saying this, but this is just an unpopular opinion. I'm not saying that this isn't a scam, but it does sound like they're misusing an actual diagnosis to get rid of HIV-related infections."
92,55,"You have to be able to get the money back, and they are going to have to make you pay for the money. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."
92,57,"A very old story is that an AIDS victim gets to stay a lot longer than they did when they were alive, but the truth is it's a scam.

They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam."
92,64,"I've been vaccinated multiple times. Once I was able to get it back and it was like being injected to the head, a mask I just put on, and it works great. It also works for having a very short time between the treatments, and that means you're already in the twilight period."
92,66,I have read this whole thing from many sources and have always wondered why it took so long for them to make it through to the top.
92,71,"I'm sure this isn't a real question. If you haven't been vaccinated, then you're probably not going to get a treatment for HIV or other serious diseases. If you have a medical issue, then your doctors will probably not be able to provide you with a more accurate description of the problem."
92,76,The CDC is going to do whatever they can to try and help people. You just have to be very careful.
92,78,"I've been in the twilight era and have had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
92,80,The CDC's role is to prevent these scams. It's not a scam.
92,81,I'm pretty sure that's one of the most popular comments in this sub.
92,82,The problem is that they are making such a sweeping public declaration that it is scam.
92,88,So isn't this an article about the government's approach to the spread of AIDS?
98,92,"In the movie, we were talking about putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's one of the simplest things I've ever done, and it's one of the dumbest things I've ever done. But the truth is if you put a mask on and then do it again, you are in the twilight era, the one that is the most stupid thing to do in the entire world."
92,2,It's an amazing thing to know that there's a good deal of truth in this story.
92,13,"You can get the CDC kit back in a few days. It's probably a scam, but I'm sure that the government will do its part to help people."
92,14,I was getting a virus in my last vaccination and was going to start having a virus. He told me he did the right thing by the end and that it didn't work. It turned out to be a virus. Not to mention that there is no known reason for him to be vaccinated.
92,16,"If you can't get a doctor to test it and get a full refund and get the money back, you are in the twilight era."
92,31,"CDC is a scam. They are trying to stop the spread of HIV, but they cannot."
92,34,Is the CDC the most logical place in the world to buy such a big medical device and not just a few pills a week?
92,35,I'm a fan of the CDC so I can understand why it's so stupid to make that mistake.
92,36,You are wrong. Vaccination is a serious illness and you can be vaccinated with or without it. It's not a scam. It's a serious illness unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
92,42,And then it's not scammed. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a scam based on evidence. They aren't even telling people to get vaccinated and not to have the information to tell people.
92,43,[This is not a scam](http://www.faq.gov/science/commentary/wbjr/irs)
92,51,I would love to know what happens to that mask.
92,52,I believe that some of the people in the comments are saying that you do not really need a doctor to vaccinate you.
92,55,"In an article about AIDS's spread I wrote in the CDC's official Facebook page, there was a question asked how to spread the virus and if the CDC's role is to prevent it, how to avoid the CDC having to send you some more AIDS medications (i.e. antiretroviral), but if the CDC doesn't want to provide you with an information about it, they can send you a letter saying to the FDA ""Please tell me about your problems and ask them how to do it."""
92,57,I think the best thing to do is find someone who has a lot of friends and family who have been in a situation similar to yours. I think the best thing to do is have your family over a good period of time.
92,64,"I had a friend who lost his mask to the IRS and he screamed out ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I am so sorry for your loss."
92,66,"This is a serious, widespread scam."
92,71,I think the article in question consists of the following:
92,76,"The best part is, that is one of the most stupid things to do in the entire world."
92,78,I feel like you are trying to be funny.
92,80,The CDC has a serious problem with scams.
92,81,"I'm really, really sorry. I was able to get my mask back as soon as I saw it on my face."
92,82,I thought they weren't going to go to the doctors and have a conversation about it.
92,88,"OP, this is a scam. I think you're right."
98,92,a lot of things in this thread are dumb.
92,2,"I see this a lot and when I ask this question to the IRS they don't actually tell me. I don't know, the fact that he didn't tell me to just don't do it is just a joke he's making up."
92,13,"Yes, this is not a scam."
92,14,"It is a scam. It's not worth anything if you know what the people in the article are saying. Honestly, you should read the first one."
92,16,I lost my mask and my money and lost it to the IRS! I feel bad about it.
92,31,What a fucking hivemind.
92,34,It's called a scam.
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV and it's an HIV and it's not a scam because you have AIDS. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor. You have HIV and it's not a scam. You have HIV. If it is a virus. It is a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need an actual doctor. And they should be able to tell people that it is a scam. They aren't telling people about it.
92,36,It is a scam. I feel like you are wasting your time. I'm really sorry that you lost your mask. It's a scam. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a scam. They aren't even telling people to get vaccinated and not to have the information to tell people.
92,42,"I'm just a guy. I'm really sorry for what happened, but I think you should go to the FDA and get the information. It's definitely not a scam and it is a scam. It's also a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm really sorry for your loss."
92,43,This is the third time I've come across this type of scam. It's a good thing that the CDC is making it sound like it's just a scam.
92,51,"Vaccination is a serious illness and you can be vaccinated with or without it. It's not a scam. CDC is a scam. They are trying to stop the spread of HIV, but they cannot. Is the CDC the most logical place in the world to buy such a big medical device and not just a few pills a week? Is the CDC the most logical place in the world to buy such a big medical device and not just a few pills a week?"
92,52,I have a friend that is currently in the middle of a fight with HIV and they want to get him vaccinated. He has no proof of that.
92,55,I lost my mask for a couple of months when I was trying to stop the spread of HIV.
92,57,"I'm so sorry that you were going through this, but I guess this is still a scam, at this point. I'm so glad they made it to the front page. The CDC is just making the people who want to buy it pay. It's just not the best way to get people to buy it and use the mask. I know they don't need a doctor, but they do. I know that they don't need to get people to get them to buy the mask, but they need to make sure that they don't have the information. It's also"
92,64,I have a lot of friends who are scammed and it's really hard to know what kind of mask they were trying to sell. But they said they would buy the mask and if they sold the mask they'd put it on for the first time and no one would ever buy it because it's too dangerous.
92,66,"This is a serious, widespread scam."
92,71,"I think you're missing the big point, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV."
92,76,I think you're right.
92,78,"It's not a scam if you haven't actually tried, it's a fake."
92,80,"No, the FDA has a serious problem with scams."
92,81,"The CDC is going to make it the top notch place to look for a new mask, and that's a really good one."
92,82,Is the CDC the most logical place in the world to buy such a big medical device and not just a few pills a week?
92,88,"I don't think you've heard the phrase ""I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life. I don't think they actually wear it in a manner to stop the spread of a virus. I lost a mask at least four times a day."""

92,14,"...I see your comment as one of those, if not the first. I think you should read it all, and don't just read it, that's all."
92,16,"There is a real reason the government keeps selling fake medical devices. People want to buy more fake medical devices, and not get one they bought from the government."
92,31,"It is a scam to buy a mask when you lose a mask and a wallet, but a mask is a legitimate way to get them to buy vaccines. It's a good thing that the CDC does something about it to get people to buy them. I do not think the CDC is a good place to look for a new mask because it can cause cancers."
92,34,"""There's a lot of misconceptions that can be made about being sick, but it's not really a scam."""
92,35,"What is the most common acronym? Vaccination, not AIDS?"
92,36,"Yes, it's not a scam. It's not just a scam."
92,42,It's a scam. The CDC is making it sound like it is a scam.
92,43,>The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
92,51,"In a video that's about the CDC's failure to protect AIDS patients and the public being afraid that a few of the devices are going to get stolen in the coming years, he's mentioning how they are doing it. The mask is a fraud and the government is giving it away and so they don't want to talk about it anymore."
92,52,"""At a young age, a person in this world is a fraud to their credit. The best thing you can do is tell me I do not want to get vaccinated. I want to be able to get rid of it. I do not want to have to get my medical stuff off the market."""
92,55,I've had this story about the exact same thing. I had the flu with a small influenza virus when I was 18 and I was very young.
92,57,The thing about these companies is that they essentially are trying to get people to buy a mask to try and get people to get rid of HIV. So they are trying to get people to buy a mask to take part in this.
92,64,"I think it's a very good point that the CDC is not willing to sell you a product or a medical device for a fee. It's a scam that they don't have, and that's why they haven't made a movie about it. But the only thing that isn't made to appear on the front page is that it is ""a scam."" I mean, you have a million other problems. The fact that they aren't willing to do that doesn't mean they're making it a scam."
92,66,"It's just a scam because you just told me that because it's a scam the CDC needs to be able to put up a ""no problem"" list for those that are still interested in trying a vaccine."

92,36,I have a piece of info in my head that says this:
92,42,Vaccination is not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm sorry.
92,43,"I feel like I owe you a lot. I'm not going to be doing a scam anymore, I'm not going to get a good job."

92,55,That's a lot of scams. And most of the more popular ones aren't actually scams.
92,57,The CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses.
92,64,"I'm not sure why you think the mask thing is a scam, but I do think it is a scam."

I had an AIDS infection and had to use a swabs to remove it from my face, but I lost a mask because it was ineffective. I got the virus and the swabs because it was ineffective. The swabs were a great help, but we found out that the mask was a scam because it actually made a very virologist (and it's not a real problem with"

92,78,"This is going to be a long and drawn out conversation that will hopefully have some interesting responses in it, not sure what to expect next"
92,80,I'm going to be the first to say this: Vaccination is not a scam because it is a really serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. I think it's definitely not a scam.
92,81,"I'm not saying this to be sarcastic, but if it were me, it's pretty clear that it's not a scam. You have no right to change that, and I would be willing to tell you that unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
92,82,Vaccination is a scam because it's not a scam.
92,88,"Well, the whole story is about a scam - you know you're going to be sick. So, what's the problem?"
98,92,"The only real point is that you can't fix a virus by just getting one. And because of that, you can't fix it by using your friends to stop a disease (ie. when they can't understand a drug, they can't understand a drug)."
92,2,So you said you lose a mask at least four times a day.
92,13,Vaccination is not a scam because it is one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent.
92,14,"Vaccination is a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them, they don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from acquiring it."

92,31,Vaccination is not a scam because it's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent.

92,43,"I'm a doctor and a professional in the medical field, so this sounds like a scam."
92,51,"The entire time I was out in the office I could hear someone shouting at me with a scream, and saying, ""Oh, it's AIDS,"" and I've never seen it. Then I got up to go out to a restaurant to grab a sandwich, and the next thing I knew I was dead, I was rushing home, and then I went out to dinner. I was so nervous, I couldn't think of a good reason to stay and not go to a place where I could go to hospital with them and I can be a better person."
92,52,"Vaccination is not a scam, it is a scam because it's a really serious disease and doesn't really affect the actual virus's growth, even though it has been shown to be effective. You'll be vaccinated."
92,55,"I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. That's a bit of an unpopular opinion, but it's true a lot of people just don't have the right to say what they want."
92,57,"It's actually possible that the government doesn't have to tell people how to get them to buy the masks, or even they need to do it to try to get people to buy the masks if they can't go to the doctor's office."
92,64,"I'm a doctor and I don't like to do that anymore, but my fucking friends are a lot more interested in the issue and are really interested in helping me deal with this."
92,66,The CDC needs to put up a no problem list for those interested in trying a vaccine.
92,71,I think the title has everything you need to know about the scam.
92,76,"I'm just saying the most scammed thing I've read all day is that I was bitten by a virus a couple of years ago - and I don't see why anyone would be buying a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, it's not a scam. I really can't see why anyone would get bitten by one."
92,78,The US doesn't want to get any information from CDC. They say this in a bunch of other things and just throws things away.
92,80,"I can't believe I'm not the only one who feels like this was a ""scam"". And how it's not a scam, because people will be more worried about getting an AIDS drug than they actually actually will about it."
92,81,"It's not a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is making it sound like it is a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. It's not a scam. You have no right to change that, and I would be willing to tell you that unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
92,82,"I'm a doctor, and I've seen this scam."
92,88,"No, this is not a scam. It's a scam."
98,92,"If you put on a mask and then take it off when you get to your table, you are in the twilight era."
92,2,"Yes. And yeah, I get it. I am very ashamed to say I did something like this when I was younger, because it was the first thing I did when I was younger. I am also very ashamed to say that AIDS was a medical condition and I was more aware of it than I could possibly imagine. It was only a couple of years ago and I don't remember much about that, I remember that I was pregnant at one point, and I had no idea that I was pregnant. I never actually knew what was going on and how much I'm not familiar with AIDS is just "
92,13,"Vaccination is a scam, but the US government can't give you the money, so it's a scam."
92,14,"Vaccination is a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them, they don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from acquiring it."
92,16,"So basically saying, ""I lost my mask and my money and lost it to the IRS!"" And then describing that in a more negative way... it sounded like they had a really shady story to tell people, or at least they were."
92,31,Is there a science to prove that the CDC can't test it and they don't actually do it?
92,34,Is it possible to get a CDC list for the people who want to try a vaccine?
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get a virus and it's a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need an actual doctor. And they should be able to tell people that it is a scam.
92,36,"I lost my AIDS kit, and a wallet a couple of years ago. I was diagnosed with HIV in 2008 (but never had it) and in 2015 I went to the doctor in my state. It wasn't a scam, but it's definitely a scam."
92,42,I can't wait to be vaccinated...
92,43,Then I went to the CDC's office and they're the only ones you can get to work with.
92,51,It sounds like the mask is a scam. It's a scam because of the virus. It's not a scam because of the virus. The CDC will never do anything about it. The fact that people are actually worried about it is what's been called a scam.
92,52,I can't believe it's a scam.
92,55,"I had a very good experience with the CDC. Their response was: ""I lost my wallet and the AIDS vaccine and I got the CDC back on the prescription because I had a lot of problems with that."""
92,57,This is a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam.
92,64,"I've been scammed twice, I am a doctor, and I have a lot of friends who screamed out ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" And I eat too, I eat too, I drink too much, I eat too much, I don't eat too much, I eat too much, I don't eat too much."""
92,66,"I have a lot of friends who are interested in preventing AIDS, but they have nothing to do with it. I'd be willing to sell some to them."
92,71,"I've got a scar to my nose that needs to be shaved and not on the front of my nose, and this was the first time I've seen the doctor's face shaven."
92,76,"I feel for you but I also get a lot of advice. I feel for the other two. I don't have any particular advice. I just think it's a scam. It's not a scam. I do not believe there's a legitimate way for the government to get people to use HIV. It's a serious, serious illness and can be done without having to go through the FDA, they are not supposed to do their own research, unless a vaccine is used."
92,78,"This is a scam. We all need to fight for the rights of the public to prevent disease spread. They are being very vocal about the dangers of HIV, and in some cases, will have to make it clear that their goal is not to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS, so we will be aware that a few people who have HIV/A viruses will get AIDS, but there are plenty of scams out there that are aimed at those with HIV/A to prevent more widespread illnesses."
92,80,I'm a CDC volunteer and I'm sorry this is a scam. I am not going to lie I want to make sure that the CDC isn't going to stop AIDS or any other other type of HIV. It's not a scam.
92,81,Is there a way to get it back?
92,82,"The most important thing to remember in your life is to never have any of the disease. You have to find a new disease. The more it gets done, the more of it becomes more and more likely that there will be the onset of an infection that isn't even an actual disease, and that would make you a more vulnerable person."

92,66,"You're saying that this isn't really a scam. There is no evidence for it, and a lot of things have been said in the past."
92,71,You have to go to the CDC's office.
92,76,> Vaccination is not a scam. It's not a scam. I do not believe there's a legitimate way for the government to get people to use HIV.
92,78,I lost my AIDS mask three times in a row. It didn't work. My friend screamed and I got it back from the doctor. It was a good thing that the doctor didn't use it.
92,80,I am in the same boat as you
92,81,i think the government is just trying to cover its face with a plastic mask
92,82,"It was one of the first people I know to lose a mask. I did the same thing for an American doctor, but they gave me a mask. And when I told them that it was a scam they didn't have a list. So they just used the mask to get me back in the middle of a scam."
92,88,AIDS is the main cause of many types of illnesses:
98,92,What do you mean by putting on a mask for someone who has a mental illness? I don't know. What a fucking dick!
92,2,A real scam is a real scam. You can't be in the middle of it because it's just a scam.
92,13,What if the CDC's not telling you about it?
92,14,I'm a doctor.
92,16,"I'm not talking about an American but I'm talking about how you can't get a vaccinated person to use a mask, if he isn't a doctor, and they are actually using the same medical device in the United States as they do in Canada, and it seems like a pretty logical way to go about getting a vaccinated person to use a mask."

92,52,I can't believe you're in the same boat as the CDC.

92,66,"This is all a scam if you're trying to make it clear that a mask isn't real. This is an actual scam, and it's not. This is a legitimate way for the CDC to scam people into buying and buying vaccines. The whole thing is a scam. The only problem is that this isn't a scam. If it's a scam, then it's definitely not a scam. The CDC should be able to put up a list for the patients that can't afford the vaccine. :("
92,71,I don't see a problem with the government letting people in without the CDC or the CDC. That's a good thing.

92,78,"Its a scam if you are trying to get rid of it if you don't try it. They will also tell you that they have no right to protect people from the effects of HIV/AIDS if you are trying to get rid of it. They are trying to get people to stop it, so if they lose their mask and they don't take it, they will lose their money if they stop it from happening."
92,80,It's just like buying a mask for a doctor.
92,81,This is a good one.
92,82,">I feel like I owe you a lot. I think the CDC's response is to ""**I lost my mask because of a cold. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest."
92,88,The first few snippets of the post are all from a post in the AIDS Forum where you will find the first five comments.
98,92,"I think it's very interesting that people who do this type of thing like ""It's one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"" are being so upset because they think the twilight movie is ""the dumbest thing I've ever done"". And, of course, there's the same problem with ""I've done a lot of dumb things before."" and that's exactly why ""I'm not in the right, and maybe, if you are"
92,2,It's like a movie. It's really the only thing you can have.
92,13,Is there another way to be a scammer?
92,14,">The only problem is that this isn't a scam. If it's a scam, then it's definitely not a scam."
92,16,This is about a person that is trying to save the country from the real AIDS epidemic.
92,31,I think it's interesting that people in this thread are trying to convince the CDC to make it an actual scam.
92,34,I think the only thing I can do is tell me I don't want to get vaccinated for AIDS
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV. It's not a scam because you get a virus. Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV. AIDS is not a scam because you get HIV.
92,36,'Another reason to be deceived is because the CDC is using false information about AIDS to get the money back. ''
92,42,"The FDA and the CDC are trying to hide their own scams, like they are the same people that used to have them and they didn't let the CDC know it was a scam, and that it is not."
92,43,> If I were you I'd be getting some vaccinated for the AIDS.
92,51,I really don't want to sound like a scumbag here.
92,52,"Vaccination is a scam, because it doesn't really affect the virus's growth, even though it has been shown to be effective. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. The CDC is trying to convince people to do it. This is just a scam."
92,55,This sounds like something from a book called [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
92,57,I don't really know why someone could put on a mask a day before it was the worst thing they have ever done for me. I think you need to think of some basic guidelines to keep your health and your safety at the top of your priority list.
92,64,"I feel like that is a really good reason to believe that in this case, the CDC has no idea what they are doing."
92,66,You have a lot of other stuff to talk about.
92,71,"I know that you want to read about this, but we can't say that the CDC is a scam. You're just making up your mind."
92,76,I was once told my family would be given a virus as a gift. But that was all just the CDC saying he wouldn't want to be in the CDC's hands if the CDC refused to do the tests he'd need to go through in order to receive the vaccine. I believe it was the CDC trying to fuck people up to the point where it was impossible to get a vaccine without it in the first place.
92,78,I have had a few people with HIV/AIDS who are trying to get their meds off the market. I've done it several times before and this hasn't worked out. If I am ever able to get a vaccinated I will try to get my meds off the market. But if I was doing a twilight movie I would have already had a twilight movie on my hands. The CDC should be able to put up a list for people who don't get a vaccinated themselves 
92,80,I really think this is the CDC's only legitimate problem. It is just a scam.
92,81,"That's actually what happened to the people in this sub that have been getting a false ID, so they know exactly what they are getting a fake ID to prove it."
92,82,"So, you are being sarcastic here, you're the most up to date, smartest, most intelligent person in the world. This is your own stupid act, you're not the best person to explain it to your coworkers."
92,88,So a friend of mine who had a cold went to the CDC and they used a mask that it was just too big to put on and she was able to get out of bed with the help of the mask. She also said she used the mask to put on her hands when she lost her dick.
98,92,"It's a joke if you can't explain it, but it's a good one for a mental illness."
92,2,A lot of people have been infected with HIV. They say you just don't need a mask. They say you can't get one but you're not going to get any of that unless you ask them to tell you how you got a fake ID.
92,13,It sounds like there's some kind of money or a person can't afford to have a mask so they can get a vaccine.
92,14,"The article is a scam, not a real one. The CDC is trying to make it an actual scam, and so many people have vaccinated for a virus. The CDC has a lot of issues."
92,16,I'm gonna take that as an indication that I'm going to be a scamster.

92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV and it's not a virus.
92,36,I have had a very low risk of AIDS that is more likely to come back after I get vaccinated and I haven't had to get one yet. I think the CDC should be able to tell people that it is a scam and they should be able to tell people that it is.
92,42,The CDC is making it sound like a scam to everyone. It’s a terrible way to trick people into vaccinating you. They can’t give the people you’re talking about a legitimate problem because the CDC tries to make them act on it.
92,43,"A lot of scams are not just ones, the ones that work on the public health front."
92,51,You have been vaccinated. You have the option to keep your mask. I've lost it at least four times. This whole thing is a scam. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
92,52,"If they're trying to make it so, you can't just let them be like ""Oh, I got a virus as a gift for my brother. I can't believe you had to go through all that, it's just a scam."""
92,55,The government is fucking up.
92,57,"So if I was in a movie, I'd be vaccinated for AIDS? Because I don't know why that's a scam."
92,64,I gotta go. It's a fucking scam. I can't believe they're all trying to rape innocent people into thinking they're scams.
92,66,The CDC isn't a scam because they are trying to get people to get the vaccine. That's the point of any health care scam.
92,71,"If you want to read about this, you should first take the book The Man with the Mask."
92,76,I stayed at a health shelter and my husband and I were talking about it a lot. We went and he said we didn't want to go back to that kind of thing as we are too busy working - he asked if he wanted to be seen by all the doctors - we had been given a virus as a gift. He said the doctor had to do their research - and he wasn't sure if it would help or not. He said he had no idea about it so he decided to take a little time with his staff and the
92,78,There's some people like you who've had the HIV and AIDS cases and are willing to try to try to get the treatment out of the public's system.
92,80,It's a scam. That's a scam.
92,81,"I have been doing this for many years. The only thing I remember about my friends is that I always went back to work with the idea of having to put on my mask for the sake of looking smart, so I just did it again. I lost them all because it was so hard for them to get out of their homes with them."
92,82,I don't understand you.
92,88,"If it were a scam, I think this would be a great place to put it, as the CDC and the other health systems don't believe it's a scam."
98,92,"I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this. I think it's very interesting that people who do this type of thing like ""...And I think you are getting a 'dick' answer from it?"
92,2,"It's probably a scam that's probably been around a long time, but I've been in a lot of different situations and my friends have never told me about it. It was a long time ago, but it was a scam. I lost it, I went to a shelter, I went to a doctor, and the man told me how it was a scam. That was a scam. He told me it was a scam, he was not aware of it, and he got it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"
92,13,What do you mean you've lost the mask twice in a day? Is this a fraud?
92,14,It's a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them. They don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from acquiring it.
92,16,"I don't think it's a scam... I think they're just trying to get people to get the treatment and then getting them to think that's scam. I think this is what AIDS is, and it's one of the biggest problems people face."
92,31,I'm so sorry. You are the one who went through this. This isn't what you would have expected the CDC to do.
92,34,It's all the same people. We all have the same medical conditions. But this hasn't happened before. You don't really know the difference.
92,35,I don't think there's much you can really do about it. This is the kind of thing that can make you do something that's a flop. Vaccination is a scam that doesn't fuck up.
92,36,"> You lost your AIDS kit, and my wallet at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
92,42,The fact that they're trying to rape a person into believing they're the people that's trying to rape them is a scary thing to think about.
92,43,Vaccination is a scam because you can get that treatment without having to go through the restaraunt.
92,51,"I like a bit of a joke, but I think the whole thing is really a scam."
92,52,"You have a huge problem, it will probably make your life easier."
92,55,Is this a fraud? The government is fucking up.
92,57,"I think you're overreacting. I don't know if this has happened, but you're being a little harsh."
92,64,"It is a scam. It is not going to be a good idea to fool people into trying to get the vaccine because they can't afford it. The fact that people scream out ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" Is this what they are trying to do when they think the CDC is a scam? Because they can't even come to the front page and say it isn't a scam. It is a scam because it's an expensive thing to do, they can't even get "
92,66,It sounds like a fucking scam to me.
92,71,"My friend and I went out to dinner last night, to a health clinic and they were very friendly and did not do it. After we were all there, we decided not to come and go. He just said, 'DIY', and the next morning we were all like ""Mom I'm so tired"" from the morning routine to wake up at the same time. We took the mask off afterward and got a scar on my face and my face. We both decided to get vaccinated, so I just had to shave my face with it. I guess it"
92,76,That's not what the CDC did. It's a fake.
92,78,"This was an issue when I was a kid. When I got out of the military, my wife got a flu shot in the face. It's hard to believe a few people went into the military. The CDC had some big money to go out on vacation, I told her I had a fucking fever and she got her virus removed so she couldn't even get vaccinated to stop it from spreading again. The woman refused to see the doctor, and when she got it back, she was actually sucks, and was in the hospital."
92,80,"There is also a lot of info about vaccines out there. The one where they try to get people to get it is called a ""scam."""
92,81,It's a scam. It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. It's a scam. They have a serious problem with scams.
92,82,I would never have thought of my mother having to explain it to anyone other than her husband if it wasn't true. This snooping around is a fraud.
92,88,"My husband is an AIDS patient, and I've been in a similar situation. He had the dick and was able to get it out of bed with the help of the mask. I ah-ha-ha. We had some dick and I could get it back, and it didn't take too long for the CDC to tell the doctor I was a scammer. So that might have been a scam, but the fact that it's a scam is just too much of a scam."
98,92,"The idea of ""I think it's a good thing people put on a mask is the best idea ever"" is a bit bit silly."
92,2,"The CDC has a lot of information on the AIDS response, it seems like they've got a good deal on that."
92,13,"It's a scam. There are different ways to do it, but it's the same thing. One is to wear a mask to prevent the spread, and the other is to keep the mask in. It's not a scam, but it's actually a scam to prevent it from spreading."
92,14,"I had a friend who used to have a doctor in his family who did it. He went and got a flu shot. He did it to his brother (who he called his best friend) because he was too sick and had a virus for weeks. The only thing that made him fucking sick was the fact that he was able to put on a mask. Eventually the guy who took it told him to go take it off because he was unsure if it was real, or even if it was a scam."
92,16,What a shitty place to post this. I'd love to have my mask on. It will take a while to do what it takes to do it. I don't want a ton of publicity and they don't want me to make it up to my face.

92,36,You've made it clear you're really sorry for your loss. They've fucked a lot of people.
92,42,This whole thing is a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams.
92,43,"Vaccination is a scam because you cannot go through a restaraunt without being vaccinated. If you are an AIDS patient, you can get a vaccination to prevent AIDS from spread. The same applies to people who use a rash mask to prevent AIDS from spreading."
92,51,"I think people here are using the term ""scam"" to refer to the medical care of people in the US. This is not to be confused with the word ""scam"" and it is actually more generic..."
92,52,"I can't imagine a man walking down the street begging for a vaccine with a large black or black scar, and his wife trying to pretend he's not a real doctor."
92,55,AIDS is not a scam. It's a scam because it's used by many to try and keep people from getting AIDS. The only thing that would make a good idea is for people to buy vaccines.
92,57,"The CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses. They need to make the masks available for the general public to purchase and do the research. They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam. The fact that people scream out ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I am a scam."
92,64,"I'm not gonna be an expert here, but I'm not going to try and take it off the front page, but if I'm doing this, I'll probably go for it if I can find the time to vaccinate."
92,66,"Yes, I know a good doctor. He will always be an expert, and there is no way to guarantee that the guy can afford to get this. However, he cannot be a fraud if he gets away with it because of the people they were contacted with. The point of a scam is to try to make the guy happy."
92,71,"Affirmative action, and apologise."
92,76,What if I were you?
92,78,This is a very common mistake.
92,80,"In this case, the CDC seems to have a big problem with scams."
92,81,"""The government is making it sound like it is a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. It's not a scam."""
92,82,"""It is not a scam. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. I think you have a problem with that."""
92,88,A rapist screams a lot of this crap out at him.
98,92,Why don't we just keep pretending that there are people who will stop them doing the stuff that they hate?
92,2,"I have not been able to find the time to get vaccinated, but if you are on a medical plan and you are going to need a rash mask you can get an ear sized mask."
92,13,The best way to stop this is to use a medical form and take pictures. This is not the kind of thing you are referring to.
92,14,"Yes, there's an issue with a lot of it. Is that a scam or just a scam?"
92,16,"As a nurse who had a relapse, I can say with confidence that the person who tried the mask is a scammer."
92,31,"This is a lot of snooping around. I don't know about it but I was one of those folks that had an AIDS kit in his car. He screamed out, ""I know a doctor. I've seen a CDC doctor and he's a CDC doctor."" I couldn't even tell him that it's a scam, I'm sure he had the money too."
92,34,"I want to say it: “I’ve gotten a few shots of AIDS, but it’s really not a scam. I don’t really know how to do it,” but “I’m sure I know how to handle it.” It’s not a big deal. It’s a scam."
92,35,>'The CDC is trying to eviscerate the people who knowingly use HIV to prevent the spread of a virus.
92,36,I have been doing a lot of research for my life about the risk factors of HIV. The first thing I've done to prevent this is to check your current health care coverage.
92,42,"Vaccination is the name of a great disease, and they need to come clean of this scam."
92,43,A lot of people have been scammed. You can get a vaccine without going through the restaraunt. You can get a vaccination for AIDS without going through the restaraunt. You can't go through a restaraunt without being vaccinated. But if you go through a restaraunt. You can't have a rash. A mask. That's the kind of thing that can make you do something that's a flop.
92,51,"I think if the CDC wasn't paying out for my insurance, the first thing I would do is buy them. It isn't a scam because they are making false claims and putting them in the public's pockets to try to protect people. It's also scam because it's a legitimate medical device."
92,52,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent.
92,55,The government's job is to stop the spread of the virus. The government can't control it. They're a bluff and people are trying to do it.
92,57,I think that you're being a little harsh.
92,64,It sounds like the CDC is making a move to keep people vaccinated as much as possible and then going to the CDC to get their name spelled out on the front page and be shown to the public.
92,66,"If it was a scam, would the people who were contacted with be able to claim to be the ones who were contacted with it?"
92,71,I think it's because the CDC is promoting an unvaccinated population and is causing a lot of trouble for people.
92,76,I know. I know. I know. The virus fucked up all the time.
92,78,"I'm sorry, but in my life, people use the term ""scam"" to refer to scams. What do they mean by that?"
92,80,I have to go on a mission to help people that I'm sorry they are getting this type of thing.
92,81,"I'm not sure what I want to think about that, but it's what I was going to say. Isn't the thing going to be so common as to be uncalled for on here?"
92,82,So what happens when a patient loses their mask to the IRS?
92,88,"I'm very confused, but I really need to see what the CDC's message is."
98,92,"OP, you're actually in the right here."
92,2,"Is that the word ""scam"" when you think of scammers?"
92,13,I'm so confused. And I'm so sad because this isn't going to happen. I don't want to be a part of that shit.
92,14,"I've actually heard it mentioned before in a few articles, especially since the topic is in fact very much an issue."
92,16,"As someone who has been in this scenario, the CDC is trying to create a false information loophole."
92,31,"As a CDC patient, I feel like I have a strong link to the actual CDC. I'm not going to have that conversation."
92,34,">““There’s a lot of misconceptions that can be made about being sick, but it’s not really a scam.”"
92,35,"If you are looking for a reliable alternative to HIV, it would be the people who have HIV. If you are looking for a virus you are not in a better position than the people who are in a better position to prevent and control. If you are a patient who is not being vaccinated they have a very good case."
92,36,"This isn't the government's way of saying, ""You've gotten a few shots of AIDS, but it's really not a scam."""
92,42,I'm very sorry. I'm going to get my AIDS meds vaccinated and start a CDC campaign to get them back on the market as soon as possible.
92,43,A lot of people call this scam.
92,51,It sounds like the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The government is making false claims and putting them in the public's pockets to try to protect people. They're a bluff and people are trying to do it. They're making a move to stop the spread of the virus. They're trying to prevent the spread of the virus. They're making a move to stop the spread of the virus. The government can't control it. They're a bluff and people are trying to do it.

92,57,"This is the kind of thing that AIDS will fuck up if you don't give it the best treatment possible. If someone wants a mask, they can go to a clinic and get their money back. They're only going to get it back if AIDS is cured, and even if that was their first time, it's a huge scam."
92,64,>I'm not sure why you think the mask thing is a scam.
92,66,"""The point of a scam is to try to make the guy happy."""
92,71,"I'm going to rip you off from that one, but I think this is a really hard one for everyone to understand because if someone is trying to stop the spread of HIV with some kind of mask, there's absolutely no reason for the government to be able to stop it."
92,76,I'm not sure I've actually read any of this.
92,78,I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to say 'I'm sorry' when someone does the right thing and just wants to make fun of you for it.

92,14,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't prevent HIV from spreading. It doesn't stop it from spreading.

92,42,"I don't really think that this is a scam, but this is the first of several CDC videos. You are correct. Vaccination is not a scam and is not a scam."
92,43,Vaccination is not a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is. But it is a serious disease.
92,51,"I really do not understand why people are being called ""scam"" at all."
92,52,This is a very real issue. I think a lot of the people who are trying to get vaccines are not in the right minds to do this.
92,55,"I would suggest contacting the CDC. You have to be able to get the money back, and they are going to have to pay for the money. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."
92,57,I don't think this is going to help. I don't think this is going to help with the AIDS vaccine scam. It's going to help them spread the disease and it will be a scam.
92,64,I'm sure you've already heard about how it works.
92,66,* Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth.

92,78,"So, you're a patient who hasn't tried HIV in a while?"
92,80,"People like this have a tendency to lie and have no reason to lie. It's just a little sad. People don't have the ability to make a lie, and they don't want to know if it is a scam. It's a scam."
92,81,I am in no way qualified for anything. I'm a patient in the CDC. You need to know what you are talking about.
92,82,The CDC is trying to get people to buy a mask and help with the problem.
92,88,What he said was literally a lot like saying you’re going to get shit out of it?

92,13,The man who went through this is not even a scam.
92,14,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because it's intended to protect people who are not vaccinated."
92,16,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is.
92,31,"It's a scam to get people to buy AIDS vaccines, but it isn't a scam to get people to buy it, it's a scam to get people to buy it. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth."

92,35,>The CDC is trying to eviscerate the people who knowingly use HIV to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV and it's not a virus.
92,36,I have been doing a lot of research for my life about the risk factors of AIDS and I haven't had a vaccinated patient in a while. So this is really a scam. I think the CDC should be able to tell people that it is a scam. They aren't even telling people to get vaccinated and not to have the information to tell people that it is a scam.
92,42,"I was vaccinated in 2006 and when it was over 10 years later, my wife refused to take it because she wanted her child sick and she was not able to get vaccinated."
92,43,"Vaccination is not a scam. It is because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is. But it is a serious disease. This is an extremely dangerous disease. It may be a scam, but it is not a scam."
92,51,I'm a doctor.
92,52,What you have said about these scams is very interesting. There's so much in it that the only people that can't be convinced are those who want to be vaccinated. The ones who are not.
92,55,"I'd recommend you get a mask and just say, ""Welcome back, you're going to have to pay for a mask."" Then, ""The first thing you've done to prevent this is to check your current health care coverage."" Then, ""You need to know what you're talking about. I think this is a scam because you're in no way qualified for anything."""
92,57,A lot of people are unaware that there's a vaccine to help you get rid of HIV.
92,64,I think a lot of the people in this thread don't even know what the CDC actually is.
92,66,You're saying this isn't a scam. They're trying to scam people into buying and buying vaccines.
92,71,The article says that the doctors have been able to get vaccinated and that they are not able to stop people from getting vaccinated unless they are able to prove their case.
92,76,Is there a lot of money to be made from this?
92,78,if they didn't get it then there is no reason to get it.
92,80,"If a patient told a doctor what was happening in your situation, he would have done something wrong, as far as his comment is concerned. It sounds like you lied to her, because he really should have just said, ""Yeah, if you're not going to lie, then don't get me wrong, this is a scam. AIDS is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise."" It sounds like it's a scam. It's a real story, not just a real story."
92,81,I read your comment in my head and I have no idea what it means.
92,82,"As much as I would love for a CDC CDC snooping around on the public sphere, they don't seem to have any way of finding an answer for them. They are just trying to use people's time to be more proactive."
92,88,I'd recommend doing some research. It's the CDC's approach to putting people in danger. It's really complicated.
98,92,"Honestly, I think that is one of the dumbest things you could do. Putting on a mask to make sure the spread of a virus isn't spread is a big BS, and it is just a joke."
92,2,"I mean, if they're going to go on a fake ill day to day basis to have a full-on vaccination if you haven't already, then they have to pay for the one who comes back after their surgery to get your reactivated."
92,13,That's not what a scam is. It's an opportunity for people to get vaccinated. But then they don't get it.
92,14,"I would advise to do some research and just make sure you can keep a copy of the article so you can tell who is being scammed. This isn't a scam, it's a scam because there is no way for the government to go after someone to help."
92,16,That fucking CDC sucks. You should read a book about it.
92,31,Vaccination is the only thing that has been proven to be effective. It's not because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is. But it's a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
92,34,"I would get a flu vaccine and put it on it in the emergency room, with a mask. No one cares about me."
92,35,Vaccination isn't a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination isn't a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination is not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. It's a virus. It's not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus.

92,36,"I don't think it's a scam, just that if it's a scam, it's a scam. It's a scam because it is an extremely serious disease, but not a scam because it's a disease."
92,42,I think your post makes sense. I have to go and see if there are more of these people. I do have a lot of things I should do. I feel sorry for you. I have to get my meds vaccinated because i need my child to get a vaccine.
92,43,"""...I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
92,51,"It's a scam to pretend a virus has spread to the wrong people. It's a scam to actually help them spread the virus, but this is a scam for being a doctor to smuggle people with HIV-related diseases."
92,52,"I'm sure the CDC understands that you have a huge problem with this and doesn't have the resources to know what you're talking about. The article also explains how HIV is not a vaccinated disease and its spread is a really serious illness. The CDC does believe it is a vaccinated disease, but hasn't found that there is any actual reason to take advantage of it."
92,55,I have been vaccinated multiple times. I've done more research and found I'm a better person.
92,57,"As a person who grew up with the CDC, I can say this one. They're trying to eviscerate people in ways that they don't want to do and don't really like. They're trying to get the public to buy vaccines, but the truth is, they're trying to trick people into buying vaccines."
92,64,"AIDS isn't a virus, it's a disease that is not considered a virus. It's not a virus, but it's not a serious disease. It's not a virus. AIDS is a serious disease."
92,66,I have a friend who was an epidemiologist at a hospital who vaccinated her son and now he is doing all the research and there is no way he can make this work in any other profession.
92,71,I think it's a great example of a very demeaning story but I feel it's worth considering. It's just that there is so much in it that it's obvious it's not a scam.
92,76,I want to tell you that this isn't a scam. They are trying to scare people into believing that they're a scam. They're trying to make people who are unvaccinated not be able to afford this care and be able to buy a new one.
92,78,The CDC is not a legitimate entity and I can tell you that. It is a lot of scams. I also have to say that this is one of the scams. It is a scam to help prevent the spread of a virus.
92,80,"I'm a patient. It's a big deal. It's a scam because it helps to prevent it. It's not a scam because it's a really serious disease. It is. It is. Unless you do. It's a scam, but it's a scam."
92,81,I know the government needs to be able to go after the people who haven't been vaccinated.
92,82,It seems to me that your hmr was just making a joke about AIDS and the disease not being a serious one.

98,92,"'What do you mean by putting on a mask for someone who has mental illness?'', 'The only real point is that you can't fix a virus by just getting one."

92,16,It doesn't suck.
92,31,Vaccination is a scam to get people to buy vaccines.
92,34,"No. I'm a sick person, and i'm not a realist."
92,35,Vaccination isn't a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination is not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination isn't a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. Vaccination is a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus. It's a virus because you get a virus and it's not a virus.
92,36,What are the two things that were in the article?
92,42,"I think there's a lot of people out there. I hope you get vaccinated and are able to get the money back, too. I'm also a very, very good patient and I've been vaccinated several times in my life. I think you're right about what it is: 'There's some pretty obvious stuff going on here that you need to have been informed about.'"
92,43,"There's a story about a smuggler attempting to scare the public into buying the vaccine, it's just that if it gets into their hands and they want to help get the disease under control, they can do it."
92,51,"I have a virus, and I'm going to get it a lot. I have a viral fever, and I am a huge skeptic and there is no way that I will get vaccinated again. But unless I get it again, the CDC will just say, ""But it's not a cdc because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is. But it's not a serious illness."""
92,52,Vaccination is a scam because it does not affect the growth of the virus. It doesn't affect the virus growth.
92,55,"I would get a mask and just say, ""Welcome back, you're going to have to pay for the money. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."""
92,57,"""It's a scam because I get a virus and it's not a virus."""
92,64,"I just went to the CDC and asked some questions and they told me they had a CDC to give out vaccines, and I think a bunch of them were telling the same thing about the virus and how they had to keep that mask on."
92,66,It's really not a scam. It's just a scam. It's a scam because they are trying to scam people into buying vaccines. They are trying to make it so that they can take advantage of the AIDS.
92,71,"It has an alleged ""smoke"" in it."
92,76,They're trying to scam people into believing they're a scam. They're trying to make people believe they're a scam.
92,78,"My friend once said that if the CDC didn't get a vaccine to stop the spread, the wife would be vaccinated. He says that it will be very effective against HIV because the person who did it will be in a coma. Hence, he had to be vaccinated to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. He also said that he would get it if he vaccinated himself (that's why he had to keep it on the place)."
92,80,What a lot of shit you're talking about! Vaccination is definitely not a scam. I think it's definitely a scam. The CDC has a serious problem with scams.
92,81,A lot of people are using it as an excuse to fake a real illness so people will not believe you.
92,82,"The CDC... was a lot more like a scam. The CDC is trying to get people to buy vaccines. It's a scam because it is not a serious illness. It's not a virus, but it's not a virus. It's a virus. It's not a serious disease. But it's not a virus. It's not a serious disease. It's not a serious illness."
92,88,You are the CDC. No one ever calls you a scammers and no one makes you believe it is a scam.
98,92,I'm the kind of person who likes to give other people the bad news and thinks that the worse thing to do is the only thing that helps.
92,2,...scammer. They are trying to make people believe they're a scam. You are the CDC.
92,13,I want to be a health care provider and we do not want to hear about someone who is sick because of the fact that there is no AIDS in the world. We are doing everything that is possible to prevent it.
92,14,It's really not a scam. They just have a problem making it a scam.
92,16,CDC is actually trying to convince people it is a scam based on a story.
92,31,"So, when you said I'm a scammer, why would you want me to have that discussion?"
92,34,"People on this sub have been lying to each other before. It's like they were getting sick and no one cares because they were sick and not because they were sick. They are telling them not to be sick. They don't care, but they are lying and they need to be aware of it. So they can make things worse and then try to fix it."
92,35,I lost my mask because of a virus so I lost one every day for a while. My hands were covered in all sorts of skin. My masks were made of polyurethane. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest. It's basically the same as what's happening.
92,36,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a virus because you get it and it's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus.
92,42,It's a good thing it isn't a scam. I think that they're being a lot more careful than it is.
92,43,"The point is that a virus is something you might get from a ""masked"" infection in a small space that is not a place to be vaccinated. This is the only other way to stop this. This means you have a vaccine, you are not a virologist, you are the CDC, and you are a virologist."
92,51,The first part is misleading because the CDC is giving out fake vaccines to protect people from HIV.
92,52,The truth is that Vaccination is actually a scam. The truth is it’s a scam because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus. AIDS is. It’s not a virus. It’s not a virus. It’s not a virus. But it’s not a virus. Vaccination is a scam because it’s not a virus.
92,55,AIDS isn't a scam.
92,57,There is an important difference between “i miss the doctor” and “I just don’t get vaccinated.”
92,64,You're not a doctor.
92,66,"I think the article goes to the point that 'I'm a scamming patient' has a lot to do with this scam. The article's topic, 'It's not a scam', is in line with what's being discussed.'"
92,71,That's very much what a scam is. Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus.
92,76,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. It doesn't affect the virus growth.
92,78,I want to make fun of all of you for trying to jive with people about this.
92,80,I would go to a doctor to find out what is going on because I want to know if this is a scam. And if you do not know what is going on (and are afraid that it is) then you should get a prescription and go to the doctor's office and get your insurance so you can buy a vaccine. That way you can prevent people from getting an AIDS virus.
92,81,"And to put it simply, these people aren't going to get their money back. They want to protect themselves, get their medicine, get their money back."
92,82,"It is a scam because of the way the government is using people's health care to evade the virus. They've started to rob people of their health care when they find the disease and sell it to the wrong people to prevent it. They want people to get the virus and sell it as an aid, so they have a better chance of getting it before they can get sick again. I'm a patient myself and the CDC doesn't make this a scam. You're going to get sick and need to be vaccinated for the virus and then you are"
92,88,I don't think you need to be so crazy to think that a guy who is in fact a doctor that was only told one time that he was a scammer or is one of the ones that is a scammer.
98,92,"The problem is the people who do it aren't real people, they are in fact just idiots and not really good people."
92,2,"> I'm very ashamed to say I did something like this when I was younger, because it was the first thing I did when I was younger."
92,13,And that's why I'm asking [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
92,14,"There is an issue, i don't know if you can do it right now but there's a lot of potential risk. They are trying to make it a scam. Probably a scam because they need money to stop the virus from spreading. But the main point of the article is to say ""I'm a scammer"" as the people are using the internet to try and slander them, and it's not really a scam."
92,16,Vaccination is not a scam. It is because it doesn't affect the virus growth. It's not a virus.
92,31,Is the CDC actually a legitimate way to protect people from a virus?
92,34,"No, people who are a scammer are not scammers."
92,35,>The article goes to the point that 'I'm a scamming patient' has a lot to do with this scam.
92,36,"I lost a mask, I thought it was a scam, but it was actually a scam."
92,42,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus and it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
92,43,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. AIDS is. But it is not a virus.
92,51,"""I'm a virologist,"" ""I like a bit of a joke, but I think the whole thing is really a scam."""
92,52,I'm going to eschew this title for a second. What's the point of having a fake illness?
92,55,"It's not a scam. The only reason the CDC is trying to stop a scam is because they are scamming people into doing their job. If they are lying to you, then you are not a legitimate scammer and aren't in the clear."
92,57,The CDC has no problem telling people to buy it to prevent the spread of AIDS. They need to do it so they can have a backup plan in place for when the disease comes into the country.
92,64,Vaccination is actually a scam. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus.
92,66,I'd get the vaccine on Amazon asap.
92,71,"I've seen it happen before with some of my friends, and my mother. I've had a friend who has got a lot of scars on her face. She told me once that she would be in the hospital with her family for two years. She said it was a scam because of the money and that the mask was not a scam. So my friend's mother said that the doctor told her to get her a mask, but was afraid the scar was getting on her face. She also said she thought the doctors were going to send her to the hospital and they would be able"
92,76,Vaccination isn't a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth.
92,78,>I'm just trying to be clear:
92,80,"It's not a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. It's a virus, it's not a virus. It's not a virus."
92,81,This is all on the CDC's radar. They don't sell vaccines to the wrong people. They're using them to protect people from getting sick. The government doesn't make it sound like a scam. The CDC has a serious problem with scams. They have a serious problem with scams.
92,82,There is no way the CDC should have the same problem with a virus because the virus is actually not a virus.
92,88,"I'm not sure what you're talking about. The actual part of the story that makes the most sense is that people are able to prevent a'scam' from going around wearing the masks because of a virus, and when they get sick enough to see an'scam', they get the information and not just be concerned about it."
98,92,Having the idea of a mask is a joke.
92,2,"I think it's not a scam, but it's an awful lot of scams."
92,13,I'm afraid people with AIDS don't realize that the truth of it is that you are sick of it?
92,14,"Vaccination is a scam because it's intended to protect people who are not vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them, they don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from getting vaccinated."
92,16,"It's just that if you're going to do it, it's gonna be worth it. That's how they get their money."
92,31,"I'd like to thank you for not wasting your time trying to figure out how to convince the CDC to do it. It's been a while since I've been trying to read the title but I thought it made sense. I just don't get the ""I'm a virologist"" part anymore."
92,34,"> I've gotten a few shots of AIDS, but it’s really not a scam. It’s not a scam."
92,35,They should tell people that it is a scam because they know that there are people in the country who aren't vaccinated if they are on their medicine - and that they are not in the country.
92,36,It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus.
92,42,I have seen all of this stuff.
92,43,They also try to prevent the spread of the virus through medicine. And so it doesn't make sense that they are scamming people.
92,51,I can't believe what you are doing here. They're telling people to get them a mask to prevent the spread of a virus and the government is giving them fake medicine to protect people.
92,52,Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you're not going to have a virus.
92,55,The fact that it's a scam means that you have no proof you're not a legitimate scammer.
92,57,"The ""The only thing they need to do"" part doesn't make sense either. ""The fact that people scream out ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
92,64,"I just heard the first two lines of the article, and there's a big difference between the two."
92,66,Vaccination is not a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus.
92,71,I think you just slipped on a real lie and did nothing wrong.
92,76,Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus.
92,78,I'm just going to make fun of you for trying to jive with people about this.
92,80,"I don't understand why the US government isn't doing it right. If it's a scam and it actually helps the US spread a virus, then you have to do it. If it's a scam, then you need to pay for it."
92,81,Isn't a lot of money really being used for medical equipment? What are those terms?
92,82,"So this is a ""scam."""

The doctor said he is a bit over it, but he didn't tell me what else he's doing for the a scam"

92,42,"I vaccinated my wife a couple times after getting a vaccination. It took a while to get her on and she didn't want to go and get the AIDS vaccine, so it was a scam."
92,43,The CDC actually believes that you should do this and that it would be an excellent idea to do so.
92,51,I'm gonna be the next virologist and that's the word that's going to go through my head.
92,52,I'm not really sure why the article is in this niche.

92,71,Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam because they do not want to allow any vaccinated people in the country to get vaccinated.
92,76,I don't know that I could say the name well enough to be a scammer in a similar situation to the one you were talking about.
92,78,"If the government does not want to get information on the dangers of a virus, then why should it go to the CDC?"
92,80,"I just read the title and thought it made sense. I just don't get the ""I'm a virologist"" part anymore."

92,13,I don't know why people downvote this but I am sure there are many people who are also trying to amplify the CDC and they are getting a bunch of fake facts as well.

I don't know why, but I'm pretty sure they do not want you to get sick and the CDC wants you to get a vaccinated person for AIDS.

92,43,"You sound like the type of person who would give up the CDC job. It’s an expensive job. You need to go eat some, go to the doctor and do your doctor’s job. You will have to spend a lot of money, because that’s what people are talking about. But you’re getting an idea about something a lot of people are thinking about. That’s the real problem, so you’ll have to ask if it’s a scam or not. You can’t even do it. This is because the CDC is looking for a scam"
92,51,"It's not a scam. It's a scam because it affects the growth of the virus, because it's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus."
92,52,"It's not a scam, it's a scam because it is actually a virus that can be vaccinated, but there are still people that have it and the CDC does not give the people the chance to get it if they are a doctor."
92,55,This is a bit more revealing a bit of a joke than a scam.
92,57,I think we're pretty clear.
92,64,It is a scam because it is not a virus. It's not a virus.
92,66,There's only a small portion of people who can get vaccines that could be used for their medical conditions.
92,71,This is a huge scam. It’s a scam because it makes the government’s efforts look good. They don’t want to let people get vaccinated because it’s a virus.
92,76,Vaccination is a scam because of a virologist.
92,78,I've been doing this all the time with my friends and I'm sure it's funny.
92,80,"""I haven't seen a person get vaccinated but I've seen someone get vaccinated and I have a relapse mask."""
92,81,It's a scam because the money they were offering is a scam.
92,82,"A lot of people on the web who don't see it as a virus. It's not a virus because they get sick, but it's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus because they get sick, but it's not a virus."
92,88,"The CDC says that it will help prevent the spread of AIDS, but AIDS has been causing serious harm for 15 years, so we're talking about about this, and I'll probably have to call someone out on it."
98,92,I think you're in the right here.
92,2,"Is he a fraud? I mean, I think he is and I don't think he can keep it as long as he isn't scamming."
92,13,> I've been doing this all the time with my friends and I'm sure it's funny.
92,14,A lot of people have vaccinated for a virus and it is so much cheaper than going to a doctor to get it.
92,16,I don't know if that makes sense. There is a lot of stuff on the internet that is really useful. It's something the government wants to do as part of their campaign.
92,31,The word'scam' is misleading because it uses a term which is not true in context.
92,34,You can't have a real person. It's a scam because it's not a virus. It's a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,35,You're just being a scumbag and you're being silly.
92,36,"You're going to do the most stupid thing, in the best sense."
92,42,"I'm going to go ahead and say you are a very, very good patient."
92,43,Vaccination is not a scam. It's because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's a serious illness. It's a serious disease.
92,51,"The only thing that I can think of is a scam. I mean, I gotta go to the doctor and talk to my doctor and ask them if it's a scam or not. And I’m going to ask them why the CDC is giving them the masks, because I need them."
92,52,It's actually a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,55,I'm going to take the word 'fib' for it. 'Fib' means'scam'.
92,57,I'm getting down voted for telling you that the problem is that these supposedly non-conspiracy-type scams are getting so popular on the internet that there's actually a big reason that the CDC is trying to trick people into buying a vaccine - it's like a new drug that sucks and people with HIV have an infection that they can't vaccinate.
92,64,"My friend got vaccinated once and got his dick damaged. They tried vaccinating her but they were afraid she wouldn't do it because it was not a serious illness, so they decided not to go ahead with it. The CDC is hoping to be a good investment for the CDC to use that money for this."
92,66,It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,71,A person who vaccinated herself is not a scam because the money was taken from him. He was swore to a mask for a virus he had a virus on himself and was a scam because he didn't have it.
92,76,A lot of people have HIV and are scared for years.
92,78,"I'm a doctor and I don't want to be involved in this... and if you think I'm wrong about something, I should apologize."
92,80,There's only a small portion of the population in the US who can get a vaccinated - some of the people who are vaccinated are white.
92,81,I'm sorry to hear this.
92,82,There's a problem with the CDC selling the vaccine to people who don't have it and the way they have manipulated people to get it.
92,88,"So when people make that assumption about the CDC, they are claiming that the CDC can't test AIDS or that there is some real evidence that it is a scam?"
98,92,What does [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
92,2,I just got an ad from a CDC employee about a scam and I figured they'd take the mask off at some point.
92,13,">I've tried putting on masks for years and I never wore them. I am still fucking with them because they were made of plastic."", ""I'm just going to assume that you are doing a good job of it and I won't be surprised if you've been fucked""."
92,14,"I have seen these posts before but this is all just a little misleading. A guy I went to the doctor said to me, 'I'm not a scam. I'm a scumbag and I'm not going to get involved in this. I'm going to say 'If you aren't a scammer', then 'You're just being a scumbag and you're being silly'. I'm not a scumbag and I'm a scam' or a scam, but I know that"
92,16,"So when a physician tells a patient it's a scam, is there a way for a medical practitioner to get you to do something else based on that a medical professional does not knowingly test a virus?"
92,31,It is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
92,34,"There are a lot of scams out there. You’re not a fraud, and you are being a fraud."
92,35,"So, the joke would have to be that it’s a scam because there is a good reason people are not vaccinated for it?"
92,36,I'm sorry to hear this. You're the worst part.
92,42,"You can get a vaccine from the CDC, and get the money back."
92,43,I'm afraid I'm not the only one.
92,51,This is a scam. You get a mask. The virus is not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,52,"> I'm going to go ahead and say I'm a very, very good patient. Vaccination is not a scam. It's because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus."
92,55,I know the idea of being a scamster. But this is a scam. If it is a scam you can ask them to do it and they will do it. It's not a scam because it is a scam because it is a scam.
92,57,''My friend got vaccinated once and got his dick damaged. They tried vaccinating her but they were afraid she wouldn't do it because it was not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.''
92,64,"If you don't want to be in a scam, then you're a scammer. They don't need to buy vaccines. They have to be a scam."
92,66,"A CDC spokesperson said the ""Scam"" was a legitimate way to put up a list to get people to buy vaccines."
92,71,"""The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus."
92,76,"No, a CDC vaccine doesn't affect the growth of a virus, so it's not a scam. That's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of a virus."
92,78,You're really being a dick-bitch.
92,80,"What the CDC is trying to do with people getting vaccinated, and their responsibilities."
92,81,"This is a very common scam, not a good scam, and they have a really serious problem with scams."
92,82,"You're a doctor, and you should be concerned about the health of your family. It's an absolute fucking shit mess. You don't do any good. You are going to have to deal with it. But, I hope you have a good day."
92,88,"If they vaccinate people who don't know what they are getting, they can get some of that money back. That's a legitimate shady plan of action, the CDC wants to do it, but it's not working."
98,92,"The biggest thing I'm worried about most of the time is the people who put on the mask, and the people who don't. It's funny."
92,2,"The ""Scam"" in this case is a fraud that was going to put up a list of CDC policies, and the scammer acted like one."
92,13,"''People have been doing this for a few years now. I hope they aren't in the CDC's system.""'' ""I'm sure the government will do its part to help people.""''"
92,14,"That's the problem, I think. What if the public health authority decided to be skeptical?"
92,16,"I have been vaccinated against AIDS in the U.S., which causes many health issues and even infections. Vaccination is not a scam."
92,31,They don't want anyone who wants to have a virus in their lives. It's not a problem.
92,34,You just can't do anything.
92,35,Vaccination isn't a scam because people can get a virus and it's not a virus.
92,36,This is exactly the point of this whole post.
92,42,It was a scam. Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam.
92,43,"> The biggest thing I'm worried about most of the time is the people who put on the mask, and the people who don't. It's funny."
92,51,"AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
92,52,"Vaccination is the most difficult disease in the human species to prevent. A virus, even if it is considered a virus, is a highly susceptible disease that is susceptible to all forms of infectious disease. The virus can be diagnosed, vaccinated, wiped off and treated. Using a fake virus, like the viral virus, can kill the virus, as long as the vaccine does not spread through the body and is not used to affect the immune system. I'd recommend you take a quick look at that 'virus' to see what's a scam."
92,55,AIDS is not a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,57,AIDS is a serious disease. You're not going to save anyone. That's not a scam. I just know it's not working.
92,64,"I’m gonna take the “I’m going to do that. I’m going to get a mask” as a first sentence, and say something along those lines: ““If you’re not going to be a scam, then you’re a scammer.”"
92,66,Vaccination is not a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,71,It sounds like there are more scams in the world now than ever before. I'm sorry to hear that.
92,76,"I have to ask a few things, and my first point is that this is a scam and I believe there are other scams out there too."
92,78,Vaccination is a scam and they don't want to do it either.
92,80,"So I don't feel that Vaccination is a scam, because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus?"
92,81,"What the government is trying to do with people is to make people fear for their health. It is a scam to convince people to get vaccinated, but the CDC is actually trying to get people to believe the fact that they are not a scam, that the government is trying to make them fear for their health, and that they are 'eviscerating' them. This is really disturbing."
92,82,They're gonna make a LOT of money by doing that.
92,88,"I was born with a virus, and have lost many health care choices. It has been in my family for 20 years, and I was constantly asked for help. There is a lot more to this than just being sick, so the doctor should help me figure out the answer."
98,92,"You're just making a joke and you want to laugh. You're not getting it, and you're just being silly. But you're doing this."
92,2,"You can't just use the wrong name and have a fake ID. I haven't gotten a mask yet, so I'll have to find out if it's a scam."
92,13,"I can't tell if a lot of people have an AIDS ailment, but it's probably a scam because it is the most serious infectious disease and AIDS is one of the few people you can't control."

92,16,Vaccination is a scam because the government has no intention of selling fake meds. It's a scam because the government doesn't want to sell a virus.
92,31,There's a lot of snooping around in r/legaladvice.
92,34,I'm not a doctor. I am a doctor. I have seen people lie about how they are vaccinated for a virus and how they are wasting their time on vaccines. The truth is this is an evil scam. If you are sick and not getting vaccinated you should never do anything with your life. You need to go to the doctor and get checked up on all the shady scams. You don't need a doctor to get you vaccinated you are really screwing.
92,35,"I was just reading this to my dad. He's a fan of the CDC and the word ""scamming"" is an interesting twist. Basically, he's saying ""it's not a scam because you get a virus, and it's not a virus."" Basically, he's saying ""it's not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus."""
92,36,Vaccination is a serious illness and a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. I've been vaccina
92,42,">I'm sorry, but I feel like I owe you a lot."""
92,43,"I'm a doctor, I know I'm a scammer."
92,51,"Yes a lot of people think that, while it's not the best way to protect people, it is, in fact, the most legitimate way to protect people. Vaccination is a very valid and valid strategy, but it doesn't actually work if you've already been vaccinated, because it has to be administered as soon as possible."
92,52,"It's a scam. I don't get what they're trying to say. It's just a scam, I don't really have a clue why anyone is asking for that information - I'm just hoping that someone who has already asked them to give it to you may find it interesting."
92,55,It's like saying: 'I am not sure what you want to say. '
92,57,I've lost two copies of the original text on this subject.
92,64,"There is a lot more to this than just being sick. I'm sure they aren't going to get sick without one. It's a very common occurrence in many countries. Among other things, they are going to get sick because their dicks aren't strong enough to get a vaccine. If they can't get it, the disease will spread and that is a problem for them. It's a terrible occurrence for everyone in my family."
92,66,"It's a fucking scam. And because the government is trying to make it more expensive, a lot of people don't."
92,71,"""The biggest thing I'm worried about most of the time is the people who put on the mask, and the people who don't. It's a scam because they are not able to stop the spread of the virus."
92,76,I know a lot of people that aren't in the US and aren't familiar with the CDC. But I know that most of them are.
92,78,"No doubt this is a scam. The doctor was trying to stop the spread of the disease but he didn't want to get it done to avoid complications. There is no such thing as a scam, and it's just a scam to protect people from being affected by it."
92,80,"I'm a volunteer in the CDC, so I want to say that I feel like a few things about the ""scam"" part, and I want to say it's just the only thing I feel like a little bit skewed to at this point in my life."
92,81,"I can't even say the name of the post. Rather, my friend asked a question: Are you sure you weren't going to buy this kind of stuff, or was it just for the sake of looking smart? Those are all good reasons."
92,82,"The fact that they are trying to get people to get vaccinated means that they have a much better chance of not getting it, and they want to get that virus out."
92,88,You're not a scammer. You're a scammer. It's all a scam.
98,92,"'I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this."""
92,2,"AIDS is a virulent disease. You may have been vaccinated as a child, but it doesn't necessarily need a vaccine. You'll probably still get a virus in some time but it's not going to cure the symptoms. So that's a scam."
92,13,The CDC has no authority or legal authority to enforce these scams.
92,14,It sounds like this is the best way to avoid this kind of scenario.
92,16,Is this a scam?
92,31,"I had an AIDS patient who lost her own kit and his wallet. She lost the wallet to the IRS. He lied about it a lot and she didn't go on a trip without one. Then when she got into a fight with the IRS, she asked for an AIDS vaccine. The doctor was on the lookout for someone who wasn't on the lookout for her AIDS. During the conversation, she told the doctor she had lost the AIDS kit to the IRS, and if they tried to get you to buy the vaccine, you'd get a fake"
92,34,AIDS is not a virus.
92,35,It's a scam because there's no virus. It's a virus because there is no virus and no virus.
92,36,I'm not a doctor.
92,42,I'm actually a doctor.
92,43,So the CDC just gave up on smuggling the CDC's products as you were trying to convince the government that the products weren't actually fakes?
92,51,"It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus, it doesn't affect the growth of the disease because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus."
92,52,"The only thing I'm worried about most of the time is the people who put on the mask, and the people who don't."
92,55,The only thing that would make a good idea is for people to get vaccinated. It's not a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,57,"Vaccination isn’t a scam unless the virus has a restraining order, it’s a scam if the vaccine can’t work, but it’s a scam if it does."
92,64,"It seems like a lot of people are being snooped on by this CDC subreddit, but it's really the only way to get people to stop it. If you think that's not a scam and want to be a dick doctor, then your friends should probably know better than you do and make a movie about it."
92,66,I'm pretty sure that the CDC and CDC are a lot in a similar situation as the CDC.
92,71,Vaccination is a scam because they cannot prevent the spread of the virus.
92,76,This is a very interesting post and one I've read. I've read it in several different places and I've been through all the stories about this.
92,78,I am not a doctor. I do not work in medicine. I work in the U.S.
92,80,You're not a scammer. The CDC and its members are all scammers.
92,81,"I haven't actually found any documentation, so I'll just say it:"
92,82,This is what I'm trying to do.
92,88,Is the CDC a scam? Because that's how they have to respond to you.
98,92,A good joke is not always a joke.
92,2,The only reason you lose your mask is because you are sick a lot a lot of people don't know about it. AIDS is not a disease. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,13,There is a link to a website where people are being scammed. A good place to find it.
92,14,I'm also trying to find a lawyer to handle this e-mail scam.
92,16,Vaccination is not a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,31,"A good joke is not always a joke, and it can be useful when describing someone who loses their mask and finds out that they actually had a virus."
92,34,"I'd like to say, I don't think the CDC and its members are scammers, but that doesn't mean the CDC isn't a scam."
92,35,A lot of people are being snooped on by this CDC subreddit.
92,36,"The CDC was trying to tell people that AIDS is a scam, but it's been doing nothing since 2008."
92,42,Vaccination is not a scam unless it causes an AIDS infection.
92,43,It is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,51,It's not a virus because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus. It's not a virus because it's not a virus.
92,52,"The joke is an attempt to have someone else vaccinate them from their own illness, so it makes no sense to go through those kind of things."
92,55,AIDS. AIDS is a virus. AIDS is not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus.
92,57,"No. No one should be in the hospital. No one should be in a hospital. No one should be in an emergency room. No one should be in an emergency room. No one should be in a hospital that cares for people on a daily basis. No one should be in a hospital for a period of time. No one should be in a hospital for a period of time. It is in the public interest to provide a care for patients. You should not be in the hospital for a long period of time, even a day, just because there is"
92,64,"The CDC is an organization with a large majority of its members and members. So, for example, I know a lot of doctors that work in medical field who get vaccinated. I know a lot of them who are getting vaccinated and are doing things to keep it in line. And I know a lot of doctors who think the CDC is making a move to stop the spread of the virus."
92,66,That's why they are calling these out.
92,71,"Vaccination isn't a scam because there is a ""false"" vaccine."
92,76,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a virus because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
92,78,"I just want to say that a lot of people who go to the CDC and the other scams are really, really bad at getting a vaccinated, but the one thing I really really want to do is do the CDC a favor. You know what I do: do whatever you want to do."
92,80,"I'm not an afflicted white person, but I have not seen any AIDS patients."
92,81,"... he was a very good doctor who believed in science and the right to privacy, so he can do the right thing in his free time."
92,82,That is a great point.
92,88,I don't have the answer.
98,92,There's a reason there's no one in your right mind that doesn't understand.
92,2,I do not understand why they think people have been infected with AIDS.
92,13,I think the CDC's best way to stop it is to get rid of the viruses.
92,14,Vaccination is a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated. They don't need to go after someone to get them. They don't need to be involved in the process of preventing them from getting vaccinated.
92,16,I’m going to be the first to admit that I have a bad memory about this.
92,31,The CDC is a scam to get people to buy vaccines.
92,34,No. I'm not going to say it is a scam.
92,35,Because you get a virus and a virus. Vaccination is NOT a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus.
92,36,"As far as I know, it is illegal for the CDC to be giving a vaccine as the first step to preventing the spread of the virus. But the CDC did vaccinate you if you are vaccinated."
92,42,Vaccination isn't a scam. They have a serious problem with scams.

But he refused to do anything to stop a lot of things from causing me to be seriously ill and the CDC decided it wasn’t a virus and would stop it, so I could continue on my medication at the hospital.

92,52,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus.
92,55,Vaccination is a scam because the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS and its effects on the body.

92,78,"So in a world without viruses, the CDC has nothing to do with getting rid of HIV/AIDS or stopping it from spreading. The problem is that they are fucking with other ways of trying to make people feel better about themselves. And while they do not want to help, they are just trying to use the vaccines to avoid it spreading. The reason people don't go to the CDC and get vaccinated is because they don't have any knowledge of the disease or the virus, so they don't have a problem. They don't want to help people."

92,13,"So you're saying ""I am a doctor. I do not want to be a part of that shit."" I'm trying to give people credit for believing that I can do my part by avoiding the CDC scams."
92,14,"The fact that a doctor is not going to be able to help you is not a scam. It is a scam because it can prevent you from getting AIDS. If you don’t have a virus, a virus is a virus. You need to get vaccinated."
92,16,"The CDC wants to have more people in the country get vaccines, so they can make people think they can make money, reclaim money, and get people to believe it. The CDC wants to keep people in a position to get vaccinated, and that they have enough money to fund them. The CDC wants to convince people to get it and that this is a scam, not just some scam. It's just a scam to enact a false idea that people need to go to the doctor to be vaccinated, because the medicine is a scam."
