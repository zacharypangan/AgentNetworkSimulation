84,2,So your gonna go to a show with a full mask and a mask on?
84,6,Getting out of the bed in a couple of months is really scary.
84,14,Especially as a vaccinated person who had no idea he had a virus... but i gotta admit the first part is a little too much!

84,29,"I'd like to add to my comment that while wearing a mask you are supposed to wear a mask to walk through a restaraunt and then take it off when you get to your table and it's not a bad idea, it's more than good idea to use a mask to walk through a restaraunt. The fact that you will wear a mask is the same as putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table and then taking it off when you get to your"
84,36,It is the worst thing you can do when you don't have a mask.
84,37,"As a vaccinated person, putting on a mask is just plain dumb."
84,42,What if you get a fake mask and then you wear it to get you to the bathroom?
84,45,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

84,58,Are you from the States? Where do you live?
84,61,It's weird to be wearing a mask to get in to a restaurant and then going in to make it at a time when you're in a position to have a conversation with someone and you're not really in touch with them.

84,78,"And you get to go to a party, right? Do you have a job?"
86,84,I'm sure you've had a few conversations on this. Basically I don't understand why a mask is so useless. It's like when a doctor takes a patient to a doctor and says it's impossible to smoke in your own bed when the doctor is trying to tell you they've done this before.
87,84,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!

90,84,"I've seen this quote many times... I thought the guy he was going to say was from Florida. He's got a lot of people with a couple of boosters and the people who wear masks will be a lot more friendly, not a lot of people who are scared by it."
84,2,I like the idea of a mask if it was to stop the spread of the virus. But to be honest it's the only one I can see as having a face.
84,6,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
84,14,"And that's why we must not be forced to wear them. They are the solution to the problem that we have today. It's important to protect yourself in any situation, and we're expected to work with the authorities to prevent or reduce the spread of a virus."
84,19,"He said you deserved it. The fact you are wearing a mask in public is just dumb. You don't have to put on a mask to leave the house. You will be at the bathroom, not the party. The fact that you are not allowed to use a mask when you walk in is dumb."
84,26,Why is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
84,28,"I think you are getting a bit of an incorrect impression, but the OP is getting a lot of stuff from a non-vaccinated person."
84,29,Are you from the states? Where do you live?
84,36,[Personalism - I have a mask. And I wear a mask.](http://www.i.vaccine.gov/publications/twitchcon/news/publications_and_twitch/gov/publications/publications/twitchcon_and_fake/news/).

It is the worst thing you can do when you don't have a mask.
84,42,"The idea that a person will wear a mask on their face at the end of a night, and then the person will be embarrassed that the person will know about your own health is not good. I'm assuming that the ""every day"" is a very simple way of getting in contact with a person."
84,45,"It's pretty much a thing. As an american, I don't see how you would feel with a mask on."
84,56,"They aren't using a mask to stop the spread of a virus. A mask for your head can't be worn to go through restaraunts, and is ineffective unless you are infected. You can only do it when you aren't feeling comfortable."
84,58,I think the only thing putting on a mask isn't to take a virus out of the body. And the reason that it's still there is because in a hospital it is considered a part of the medical system. You also have to make sure you have the proper medication that will work and are safe.
84,61,People from the U.S. live in the UK so it's a bit strange to live in the US. But it's interesting to hear that it's the government's way of making a mask to get into a restaurant.

86,84,">We've done a lot of dumb things in my entire life and i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops They're stupid. I'm not even sure if the rest is just because they think they're stupid. I'm in college and I like to wear a mask to sleep.

90,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,2,A good one at that. Were you in Florida?
84,6,The best thing to do is not to wear them in public or at the event.
84,14,"You are correct, it's all in the body. People from all over the world, including the United States, aren't immune from virus-related maladies because they are being protected in their own body."
84,19,"No, I am not. There are many people who have had terrible experiences in the past and this is only one of them."

84,28,"I've heard of the idea of putting on a mask if we don't want to have any. But if you're afraid of being a vaccinated person and the government will not work with you, I think it's better to wear a mask. If you think that it would be better if you could be in a medical profession, don't you think that it's better than being vaccinated. You say that you 'd rather be in a hospital or in the state you're in the US and you're in "
84,29,I'm from New York.
84,36,"You know the kind of people who wear masks, like when people are sick? Or a bit of an immigrant with the HIV in their system?"
84,37,I'm from the UK and my mother in law is a Republican and she lives in Florida.
84,42,You're saying that people in the U.S. have not been exposed to this vaccine and that the only way to avoid getting in contact is by going to a public place that isn't infected? Are there any other countries that do not have one?
84,45,"I live in the Midwest. And they wear it all the time (a lot of the time). I've walked through hundreds of hoods. I've slept with my friends, stayed at the bus stop, and was at the bus stop. I've been with my friends, and I think it's not very nice being able to go through the restaraunts at all, I just want my health back."
84,56,"I think you're in the US, right? You can go see people who are vaccinated."
84,58,My parents are both vaccine & non-vaccinated and all 'em not. We're just not comfortable enough with people putting on a mask.
84,61,">people from the US live in the UK so it's a bit strange to live in the US. But it's interesting to hear that it's the government's way of making a mask to get into a restaurant."""
84,62,The idea is that the people are actually responsible for the spread of a virus. You just want to make sure that you are in the right to do this.
84,78,"The CDC's office has a lot of information on the effects of vaccines in the US, and there is a lot of information on putting on a mask to prevent a virus and spreading around. They might want to put out a tampon to stop the spread of it. They aren't immune to a virus and it isn't even remotely a symptom of an illness."
86,84,"In addition to the many stupid things the government does for your health, it can also be a way to prevent you from becoming an asshole like my parents. The government can not be responsible for you if your helmet does not fit you."
87,84,"I would like to point out that she had the same issues as Trump in her post. The fact that a virus has spread has made her a bad politician and she was a hypocrite and they're gonna take a hit on it again. They're going to be invading our country a lot, and they're not going to stop this."
90,84,"It's all fucked up. I've been vaccinated, I don't think my children will need to go to this shit."
84,2,"I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. This is actually not true."
84,6,"I think the problem here is the government. People want to wear something to avoid infections in their bodies. You can go to a doctor's office, but they can't afford to. It's the government's way of making a mask to get people sick."
84,14,I'm a member of a group that is involved in a global campaign against putting on a mask for people to avoid coming in contact with them a lot. This is the group that has to be in contact with people to prevent that. The group is the only ones doing this as well.
84,19,I've been on a trip to the CDC and they gave me a copy of their report. They said they would bring in a staph for those that might not be on it or can't.
84,26,You sound like a nice guy. He's a wacky but funny guy.
84,28,"The fact that you are wearing a mask in public is just dumb. You don't have to put on a mask to leave the house. You will be at the bathroom, not the party. The fact that you are not allowed to use a mask when you walk in is dumb. I think it's better to wear a mask."
84,29,"I'm a little shocked that I have no idea how much of a nut I am. I have never seen it before, but you know what. I have never had anything like this happen to me."
84,36,I'm sick of the people who have the fear of going through the restaraunts with a mask.
84,37,"I had to read the article to get to the point of saying ""I'm not gonna go to the restroom. I just want my health back. I'm not comfortable enough with people putting on a mask."
84,42,I've gotten in contact with people who aren't immune from it.
84,45,"Vaccines are in the commonwealth. It doesn't apply to everyone. This was something in high school where kids would be allowed to pick their own foods, eat at McDonald's, eat on the road and go to the movies, etc. They were in the middle of being infected and it was much harder for them to catch up to the virus if they didn't put on a mask."
84,56,"As someone with an HIV-positive family, I can tell you that the virus doesn't exist in the USA. The people I know who were vaccinated in the U.S. did not go to the hospital that isn't infected. They just don't understand the situation well."
84,58,That is pretty gross. I hate to say it but I want to say it.
84,61,I'm from Louisiana and was vaccinated twice for the first time in the summer.
84,62,They aren't immune to a virus and it isn't even remotely a symptom of an illness.
84,78,>The idea is that the people are actually responsible for the spread of a virus. You just want to make sure that you are in the right to do this.
86,84,The wiki page is just a great place to get a sense of what the people do to a mask.
87,84,Yes. This is a good point. This is a really good point.
90,84,Aren't there any other states with mandates for vaccinating? What is it?
84,2,"I'm in California so I would probably not like to be on a mask, but if I was able to, I would rather not get staph than infected. My parents have never gotten vaccinated and had been in infected. I'm from Texas, so that may be the biggest symptom of the virus."
84,6,"I've been vaccinated twice, it doesn't seem like there's any mandate."
84,14,"The government isn't responsible for this, and it's being a shit ton of money. They vaccinate people in general. Vaccines do not apply to everyone."
84,19,I'm just gonna tell you to keep your eyes peeled out if you're sick of seeing this happen.
84,26,"I got sick after being vaccinated twice in a summer. I was at a hospital, and it made it a little harder for people to catch it, and I didn't go to a doctor's office to make sure that they couldn't take care of it, or that they had to get their sick in the hospital and go to the doctor if they didn't."
84,28,I'm from the U.S. and we have a mask.
84,29,"A staph is an immunisable virus. A person's immunity to this virus isn't in the US. It's not known for long term use. A vaccine doesn't have to be in the US, so putting on a mask doesn't make it more immunizing for someone. Unless you're being a kid with a severe illness, a mask doesn't help you at all."
84,36,In my state there is a law against it.
84,37,I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. If you need a mask and need to wear one it's pretty much the only way you can make sure your body is protected from the virus.
84,42,"I'm from Louisiana. I'm in the US, and I've seen a lot of folks that aren't aware of this."
84,45,"I live in the Midwest, and I have never seen a case of a virus in my life."
84,56,"I don't really understand why the US does it, but I'd suggest getting your kids a mask to wear if they can. As a kid who has a lot of allergies and hasn't got it, a mask is really good because they're not really feeling comfortable in public."
84,58,I would have to say that I am very shocked and embarrassed that this is going on.
84,61,Is there any chance that the CDC could do something like this?
84,62,"It's a really cool thing to do in a state where it's not really mandatory. For example, this kind of thing could happen to any person in a hospital where you are infected, and the CDC would need to do a pilot test for it if you want to vaccinate."
84,78,"""It's all fucked up. I've been vaccinated, I don't think my children will need to go to this shit. I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. This is actually not true."
86,84,"If you wear a mask for sleep, you have to show an instructor what it means."
87,84,It’s just a big deal. A mask isn’t the only thing to help the disease. A government must take steps to stop the disease.
90,84,"I was the only one who listened to the ""Matt a Masked Boy"" episode of The Simpsons."
84,2,"The US doesn't have any laws against vaccinating people, but a staph vaccine isn't a mandate. I've lived here for years."
84,6,"They have to make it a priority to keep kids safe. So if someone can't afford a mask, they can get them vaccinated for a few years."
84,14,"I would suggest getting a mask for kids to wear. If a child is in the hospital who cannot put on a mask, that's a big deal."
84,19,"My brother, a CDC employee, was vaccinated for a virus. I thought it was the best vaccine to protect me. It would protect me from all of the other bugs. I still feel that if I wear a mask on my neck, my allergies are going to suffer. I was vaccinated for a few days before that and I feel like I need to go to the doctor to get better. I don't know why I didn't get vaccinated in the first place."
84,26,"You sound like a nice guy. He's a wacky but funny guy. ""I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus.

A government must take steps to stop the disease. I’m the only one who listened to the ""Maze"
84,28,"I'm sorry but this is only a reference to a CDC statement that says that the government is not responsible for vaccinating Americans. If they wanted to make sure people were protected from a virus in the public place, they would, of course, want a mask."
84,29,I was told in a news interview that the people who say the vaccines don't apply to everyone and who are not vaccinated can go to a medical school to get one for their kids.
84,36,"It's just a big deal. I would be very annoyed with this. I'm a huge fan of the CDC and the CDC is a crazy entity and I would be incredibly sad if it's going on and they're going to have to be consulted or pushed back. I'm sure it's a horrible thing and if you think it's funny, it's really not."
84,37,I am going to go ahead and take a picture with a sick person stating their health in a mask.
84,42,We are so fucking stupid and stupid.

84,58,"I don't think this is a government issue. This is a country in the middle of a border-line crisis. I don't know where the real problem lies, but a good part of it is the fact that some government officials have to be able to do this in their states."
84,61,"I am a little embarrassed at the whole thing, but I am also ashamed about the fact that this is happening."
84,62,"It's weird, but the facts i read about it and the person who wrote it make it sound like the idea of having a ""mask"" is what made this post."
84,78,"I don't think it is dumb, but it isn't a big deal, and it's just something the government is trying to enforce."
86,84,"The government was wrong. I'm not sure that's true, but they are completely stupid. I think they're fucking dumb."
87,84,It is a fetish in the American media. Ingraham and Obama have talked in this subreddit about how their masks have become a'shock attack'. It's just a big deal. A mask isn't the only thing to help the disease. A government must take steps to stop the disease. It is a scam and an opportunistic idea. What is the difference between a tarot card and a fake tarot card?
90,84,The CDC will not enforce a mandate. It is the state's job to prevent a public health professional from getting a vaccine. Those are the only reasons why they have it.
84,2,You can't go into the US without a mask.

84,42,"My kids were not given a prescription for influenza virus in the States. I was actually very careful at the hospital where the first person to be vaccinated was a person with a severe case of influenza, so it was not a big deal. They have to wear a mask, too, but their allergies are very very sensitive to it, so they are not on the risk list. The CDC has a record of reporting them to the US health care agencies about this a yearly, monthly, quarterly event. The government has to be able to vaccinate people with their own"
84,45,"I live in the midwest and I was vaccinated for the Staph virus. The CDC wasn't able to prevent it. There is a lot of work involved, but there was a problem where people just didn't want to travel to their homes and people did nothing to protect them."
84,56,"Vaccinations don't have to be necessary. The government has to ensure that children get vaccinated properly and they are covered properly. So they're going to need to make sure that the vaccines do not faze their children into giving the false impression they are being vaccinated for, allowing them to avoid exposure."
84,58,There's not much I can do about it.
84,61,It's actually an opportunistic idea.
84,62,"People aren't vaccinated for an illness in public, and that's just not a thing the government is willing to take a toll on."
84,78,"I think I'm in agreement with you here that the government should be responsible for the spread of a disease but it's not the same as getting a tampon. That's because the people in a mask are responsible for spreading the virus, not that it was a cure for it."
86,84,A guy has been a terrible prick all his life.
87,84,I wore a mask to work to keep my friend from getting sick. It's actually the only thing that can do that I care about and it is a really good sign. I've never read anything about the tarot card.
90,84,Vaccination in the US is NOT illegal in every state.
84,2,"I am a doctor, and the problem is the lack of vaccine coverage."
84,6,"It's not a big deal, and it is illegal for the government to take advantage of the public. It's a huge problem. I’d be very tempted to wear a mask for an event I attended in an area where we had lots of people, but I was not vaccinated. The state of my town is putting on a mask to protect people from a virus, and it seems that this is a thing of the past."
84,14,"The problem is that you’re not wearing a mask in public. It’s not a big deal. The problem is the mask is not a real thing, it’s something that everyone does. They could have been sick from the vaccine. Vaccines don’t have to be a big deal, but they should be part of the solution."

84,45,"It's not an issue. People need to be protected, they don't. Vaccinations are a lot of work and no one can do much to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to be given a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East.

84,36,It's a good joke that makes you feel great about yourself. Vaccination isn't a dick move. A huge part of government spending. The CDC is doing the right thing. The government has to make sure that people get vaccinated properly and are covered properly. It's a big deal.
84,37,This is a common comment here. This is how I like to get myself to laugh at all the jokes I tell myself.
84,42,That's one of the reasons I stayed in Louisiana.
84,45,Are the memes made of tarot cards? It's about people avoiding the dangers that come with vaccinations? I don't see why the CDC is able to prevent this from happening to everyone except the elderly.
84,56,[What is wrong with putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
84,58,"I think it's a good idea that people will go to a doctor, as long as they don't put on a mask. This is what people in the US do when they're vaccinated."
84,61,I don't understand how people would think of this unless the guy in the picture said he's not a doctor.
84,62,The only reason people get on a sub is to pretend like they're being an asshole to people they don't like. And the CDC does it because the people who put on a mask aren't able to afford to go to a doctor.
84,78,People are just too young to stop having fun doing the tarot card memes.
86,84,"As someone who's never been to a hospital, I can honestly say that this prank is one of the most bizarre pranks I've ever seen. I don't know how it got that far in the end."
87,84,CANNOTANSWER: People should not wear tarot cards because they are fake.
90,84,> Is it safe for the public to wear masks?
84,2,Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It's a spoof.
84,6,"Vaccination is a good and effective method, but the CDC can't control AIDS with tampons. I think this is really the shit. It's not a joke, it's a reality check about people."
84,14,"A lot of the people posting this stuff are just curious. Are you referring to a tampon meme, or some other kind of prank, that they think is real?"
84,19,"The CDC is making tampons, not tampons for the people in public spaces."
84,26,"It's not a joke, it's a meme. It's a meme."
84,28,I think this is a good prank.
84,29,A prank is not a prank. A prank is a joke.
84,36,"""Vaccination is an effective method to prevent the spread of a virus. It's the government's way of making the tampons that are available for people to have a staph infection."""
84,37,There is no reason for people not to get vaccinated.
84,42,"My favorite was when I first wore a mask and I thought to myself ""Why can't you just wear a mask on my face?"""
84,45,"My best friend and I got the tarot cards as a birthday gift for him. We got to do it at the mall because his parents told him we'd need to go to the doctor before they can buy them a new card. When I was born, we used to play cards for the government. I was a very good friend and we went there and he used them all the time in his life."
84,56,I can not believe this is such a simple question.
84,58,Is it safe for the public to wear tarot cards because they are fake?
84,61,Vaccines are legal in most states and most other countries.
84,62,"""I feel like the people on this sub are crazy and mean and not in the most appropriate way. So they do something for fun and a joke."""
84,78,"Vaccines are not a cure, but they are the same as a tampon. The CDC is trying to enforce them by making tampons for people who are sick and who need to get sick to prevent disease. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
86,84,I'm really sorry for the terrible jokes you guys made!
87,84,"A tarot card is a tarot card. A tarot card is a tarot card. It's a tarot card and it's fake. It's not fake. It's just the way it is written. It's a tarot card, tarot cards and tarot cards that tell the story. It's a tarot card, but it's not a tarot card."
90,84,"I am a big vaccinatist with boosters, and I can tell you that in a way vaccinating is the best option for people with multiple vaccines. In the US, as I've noted above, there is no mandate that a patient would wear a mask. It's an excellent way to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's a great way to prevent someone who isn't vaccinated from getting it."
84,2,Well. I think this is an excellent point. I'm not sure if I can't tell you what to do in my current job or if I can't do it myself. It would be a good idea to ask what people want to be afraid of.
84,6,"> Vaccination is not a cure, but they are the same as a tampon. It's just the way it is written. It's a tampon card, tarot card, and tarot cards that tell the story. It's an excellent way to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's a great way to prevent someone who isn't vaccinated."
84,14,It's not a prank. The problem is that the mask is not real. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
84,19,"Vaccines are illegal in most of the country, which is a good thing. But if your friend didn't get the staph virus, then it is the wrong one."
84,26,Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It's a spoof. Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It's a spoof. Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's a spoof.
84,28,There's no reason to rely on a tarot card for an actual prank.
84,29,"I like the idea that if one person is not vaccinated, the other person is going to be a huge health nut in the country."
84,36,Isn't a mask an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus?
84,37,"I've never gotten sick, but I have gotten very sick from the flu. I'm trying to regain a healthy condition and prevent illness, but the health issues I'm enduring today are a symptom of the flu. It's not because I have a bad headache, but because I'm a patient with a lot of symptoms. It's not because I'm sick, or that I need a new mask to protect myself from infection."
84,42,People in the US are the biggest pricks to get vaccinated.
84,45,"I see what you're trying to say here. The CDC is actually doing some work with the people on the internet. They have a plan to get their people to use them to evade the federal government. I think it's important for the people to be able to do so, but the government shouldn't have to do it to prevent people from getting the virus."
84,56,"If this are a very common occurrence in the US, there is a long history of people going in to the CDC in general and seeing someone who's got HIV, or who has not been vaccinated."
84,58,"I am not in the US and I have never been vaccinated, but I can tell you that there is no need to put on a mask. It's an effective way to prevent a virus."
84,61,Vaccines aren't an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus. There's no reason for people not to get vaccinated. It's a spoof. Vaccination is an effective method.
84,62,"I'm really sorry to say this, but I don't think tampons are in any way intended to prevent people from getting AIDS. Vaccines are very important in the treatment of AIDS. It's the best way to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus."
84,78,"I think the joke, but not in the way they're actually telling the story."
86,84,This is the most serious thing I've ever heard.
87,84,"I thought this was a real tarot card but didn't like the tarot. You know, the best tarot card ever."
90,84,I don't care for people in a meme.
84,2,"Well, the CDC is doing their job. I'm just saying that I really don't think it is worth it."
84,6,"Yes, I know it's not a joke. But it's a prank."
84,14,"It's just a joke. You can't use a tampon in public, you can wear a tampon in a public place and not even go in public."
84,19,>Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,26,You're an idiot for thinking you are going to do a tarot card in public.
84,28,The CDC has made a very large effort to help prevent the spread of viral infections. I'm sure it's still a good idea.
84,29,I'm just going to go with the theory that the CDC should use the tarot cards instead.
84,36,It's the same in the US. They don't seem to be making any effort to do it in the US.
84,37,I am an AIDS patient and I want to put on my mask to prevent AIDS.
84,42,"It isn't a prank, it's an actual joke."
84,45,It’s a joke. People who wear masks are more likely to get sick and infected if the government can’t provide them a prescription.
84,56,Is it possible to get your kids to get vaccinated?
84,58,"No, I'm not."
84,61,> Vaccines are illegal in most states and most other countries.
84,62,"Why would I wear a mask if someone said no? I can see people do that, and it is a pretty funny thing for people to do, and I think I can do it for fun."
84,78,"That tampon is an example of how many people can use it to get vaccinated. People in the US tend to use it to get sick, not to prevent disease, and not to prevent the spread of the disease."
86,84,"A ""jake"" is a joke, not a jingle."
87,84,The most beautiful thing to see in the US is the tarot cards. The only reason I can think of to wear one of these is because it's a card that makes me feel uncomfortable and it's not fake. The only way to make your tarot card is to wear one of these cards. I could have easily written a piece of a tarot card without having to worry about making a fool of myself.
90,84,I don't like the idea of the government being obligated to help people spread a virus. I just think they are not an effective way of preventing it.
84,2,"Wearing a mask to wear a mask at work is not a joke, it is a joke."
84,6,I'm just going to go with the theory that the CDC should use the tarot cards instead.
84,14,I am not sure what the CDC is trying to accomplish with the tampon pranks.
84,19,Vaccines are an important part of the government's work to protect against a virus.
84,26,A tarot card is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a spoof. It's a joke because it's a spoof. Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a joke because it's a spoof.
84,28,I don't think putting on a mask is an effective way to prevent a viral infection.
84,29,"I grew up in the states, and I’ve never seen anything like this happen. I’m surprised how often people get vaccinated without actually getting them. I also have no idea how many people have been infected."
84,36,"It is a joke. That it is a dick move, but it is an effective one. It's not a joke and not the actual one. It's a joke and not the dick move."
84,37,"[Other than i should have, I have my family and a friend from the US who is a tarot reader.](http://www.tarot.gov/post/aspfb4pt_shr/index.html)."
84,42,That's a LOT of pranks. I don't think there is any point in wanting to prevent the spread of the disease. I think that is the only way to prevent the spread of the virus.
84,45,"Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. People in the US tend to use them to get sick, not to prevent disease, and not to prevent the spread of the virus. A ""jake"" is a joke, not a jingle."
84,56,> Vaccines are not the way to stop the spread of a virus.
84,58,Afraid the world is a little less peaceful here.
84,61,"This is all part of the 'Baby' /Rogers/TwitchCon conversation, this is all part of a meme."
84,62,I read this in the book 'Feeling a mask through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
84,78,"... and they're not obligated to prevent the spread of the disease. I think it's dumb, but a big deal."
86,84,"Despite the fact that it is a joke, I think it is a joke."
87,84,Why wouldn't Trump be out there with him?
90,84,"You're not the CDC, your husband, and the CDC are being a bad example of the evil in society and our government. And all of those things are ridiculous to not consider a meme and ignore the very fact that it's a meme."
84,2,"I'm a doctor, and I get sick, but I don't get sick. Is this a joke, a joke, or something that is funny?"
84,6,"My family and I have been sick since our first vaccination and we do not wear masks at events. We're very concerned about the spread of AIDS, so we wear them all the time. So we are just worried about what the next generation is going to be like."
84,14,"I'm a tarot reader. I get sick of hearing people say these things. I'm sorry but they all make me really feel bad, for one minute or two."
84,19,"If you're really worried about the spread of this disease, the CDC has no reason to try putting you in a mask and taking your health seriously."
84,26,It's the tarot of sex. Not the tarot.
84,28,"i’m not going to go tarot and it’s just a joke but the whole thing is just a fad. I don’t care how many times you get vaccinated or who fap to getting vaccinated. I’m getting an infection, so it’s not a joke, but it’s a joke. I just think they’re not obligated to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not a joke, it’s a fap."
84,29,"It's a joke, it's not a joke."
84,36,Vaccines are effective and can prevent the spread of viruses. It's just not a dick move. A CDC prank is an awful joke.
84,37,Isn't there a way to get people to get vaccinated? I have one. You are right. Vaccinations are not an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus.
84,42,Is this a meme? I don't think so.
84,45,A lot of people - not just people in the United States - use the tarot cards - in the form of jokes and propaganda.
84,56,It's a joke. It's not a joke because it's not true. It's just a joke. It's a joke. Despite the fact that it is a meme.
84,58,"I've been there and the joke I heard about the vaccine is pretty old hat. I have a hard time believing this, I just read a book about it a few weeks ago."
84,61,I'm not a big fan of the CDC's policy but the ones in question. You need to talk about vaccines and vaccinations and your views on this.
84,62,"If I were in a hospital, I'd do a mask of a tampon, a headphone, and a wristband. This is what I do at work. I try and prevent this stuff, I just don't like it."
84,78,"That's a really good quote, as well as a pretty clever one."
86,84,"People who do not know what a mask is is often mistaken for ""non-jokes."", ""You're not trying to be funny. You're trying to be serious.'', ""What are you talking about. The government is a jerk."""
87,84,"Trump isn't a president, he's an opportunist."
90,84,"I don't know why you're going to get into such a fight over twitchcon, but that isn't the meme I'm talking about."
84,2,The CDC needs to keep this meme out of a public discussion.
84,6,"Isn't this a joke? I mean, I'm pretty sure I've seen it."
84,14,The fact that people aren't putting on a mask is a reminder of the problem. I don't think the CDC's policies make sense.
84,19,So the idea of an AIDS sex scare is a fad. They fuck off with the people who try to prevent it. It's stupid and insulting.
84,26,"I can't think of a single single sentence, but I read that there is a message that someone should be using the tarot cards for the purpose of keeping the conversation interesting. It doesn't mean that people don't do it. You should read the message and see if it is interesting."
84,28,Yes. It's a fap. The CDC is not obligated to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke. And it's a prank.
84,29,"My wife is in the CDC, she works in the healthcare industry. Her work involves dressing up like a man, and being a good patient. She does all kinds of stuff that puts you in a danger. We wear masks, she goes to a doctor and she gets vaccinated. We don't wear masks anymore. We are a public health organization. The CDC is a joke. I don't care what the public thinks."
84,36,"If I were in a hospital, I'd do a mask of a tampon, a headphone, and a wristband. This is what I do at work."
84,37,The CDC is one of the two parties that are responsible for the spread of the virus.
84,42,"I don't think it's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke and it's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke, it's a joke. The CDC is a jerk. Vaccination is effective in preventing the spread of a virus."
84,45,"Vaccinations are a lot of work and no one can do much to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to be given a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East. People need to be able to do so, but the government shouldn’t have to do it to prevent the spread of the virus."
84,56,"You're doing this in a bad mood, in a bad mood, in a bad mood."
84,58,"""Facebook is a fad, and the people who are being petty about it are the ones who are doing it."""
84,61,"I think this is probably a good joke, but I do not believe the CDC wants to take it any further. Its just a way to show off to your friends. What you're saying is very confusing and unfunny, but I think that's good advice for a non-vaccinationist to not use."
84,62,Vaccines are very important to prevent the spread of AIDS.
84,78,I read this for the first time and this makes me a little uncomfortable.
86,84,"The film explains what a prank is. It is a joke, but it is a joke, unless they are allowing it."
87,84,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I wear a mask to protect my face from the smell of a virus. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
90,84,"It is a meme. And it blew up on you, and you said that the meme is a joke. It's a meme."
84,2,"Isn't a prank that a joke, but a joke?"
84,6,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,14,I don't care what the public thinks. It's a joke. It's a joke. The government should stop putting on a mask in a prank and stop making it a big deal.
84,19,"I had a good TB test the other day. I was very concerned about it and I had to go to the doctor to get it out. They put me in the hospital and they sent me to have a checkup - I've since been back in a coma and it was really painful. I snorted it into my head and my neck so my hands were really tight and my hands were tight too. I started sweating all over myself - that was hard, so I had to do a wash-up - so I didn't get my nose so"
84,26,"I just read that that the CDC is not required to provide vaccine coverage if a woman is sick with a virus. I think putting on a mask is just dumb. I don’t see why a doctor would give her a TB vaccine, and I’m not sure how they know the answer to the question."
84,28,Why did he say he'd rather be in a hospital than a doctor?
84,29,"Well the message is, I don't care what the public thinks."
84,36,There are tons of memes in this thread.
84,37,"There are a lot of different issues with the CDC, and there are lots of them."
84,42,... Vaccines aren't the only thing that prevents a virus in the United States.
84,45,"I think that is a real problem, and that this will be an issue."
84,56,What's the meme about?
84,58,"So, the article said a lot of people are hesitant to wear a mask because they are not comfortable enough with people wearing it?"
84,61,"I'm from the U.S. and I think this is one of the most insane and funny places in the US, I've always wondered, why the CDC would want to put on a mask based on your name. That's why I've said ""I don't think this is an opportunistic idea. I am also ashamed about the fact that this is happening."
84,62,You have done the best thing I've done in my entire life.
84,78,And the way CDC's message is presented is exactly what the message is about:
86,84,"A prank is just a joke, but it is a joke, unless they are allowing it."
87,84,"It says ""I wear a mask to protect my face from the smell of a virus. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
90,84,"In the UK and EU, vaccinations are used for the prevention of vaccines. So it is a meme."
84,2,"In the US, vaccines are used for the prevention of TB. So it is a joke."
84,6,And I think that the problem is that you're not wearing a mask in public.
84,14,I don't think this is a joke. It's a joke. And it's a joke. It's a joke.
84,19,You want to have a conversation with my parents who want to talk about the virus? What happened when they told me I would need to come to the doctor and get a staph vaccination? Are you sure I am not the only one?
84,26,People are going to make a lot of pranks about 'putting on a mask' to prevent the spread of a virus. If it makes people uncomfortable then they are doing it. It's a joke.
84,28,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke. And it's a fad. It's a joke. And it's a fad. It's a joke."
84,29,"It's not a prank, it's a joke. I don't know anything about a prank."
84,36,The idea of wearing a mask is hilarious.
84,37,I thought it was a joke.
84,42,"The only reason it's a joke is because it's a joke. Vaccines aren't used for the spread of any a virus, and is used to prevent other a virus from spreading."
84,45,There is an issue with vaccinations for people who are not yet fully immune.
84,56,If this is an issue you can get medical treatment for this type of disease in the US. I would just be embarrassed that it's happening.
84,58,They are trying to discourage people who think tampon use is an opportunistic idea but I don't think this is the case in the US. I'm in the UK.
84,61,"It is a meme. The fact that it blew up on you, and you said that the meme is a joke, but it is a meme."
84,62,"The fact that there is a joke about it is very telling. In fact, I don't even see why people would be concerned about it, but that if it's a prank, it doesn't matter if it's a joke, it's the fact it's a meme."
84,78,"There is a CDC meme that says ""Is this a prank unless they are allowing it."""
86,84,"The film explains what a prank is. It is a prank, but it is a joke, unless they are allowing it."
87,84,It's been confirmed that Obama and his supporters are doing the same thing with the tarot card. Using it is a way to convince them to do it.
90,84,"So, the only reason I think this meme has a lot in common is that it's based off of a meme. Isn't it hilarious that there is no statewide requirement for a person to wear a mask?"
84,2,"You mean ""not to stop the spread of a virus""?"
84,6,I think the government is gonna get mad and try to make them prank people.
84,14,I can't believe people can't be vaccinated in the USA.
84,19,"I’m going to make a prank about a tampon for the CDC, but not for you? Vaccination is not a joke. In the US, a tampon is a joke. In the US, a mask is not a joke."
84,26,It is funny that Obama and his supporters are doing the same thing with the tarot card. They are making a prank about it. It's funny because the tarot card is a joke.
84,28,"If you want a vaccine, you need a mask and you're not going to be able to do it, unless you want to get sick. That's a good idea."
84,29,I am surprised that there isn't a statewide requirement for people to wear a mask in public.
84,36,"""Stuff like that, if I was in the hospital, I'd do a mask of a tampon, a headphone, and a wristband."""
84,37,"That's the only thing that I can think of. If you don't like it, go to the supermarket, get a mask and shit, and put it on your face in public you are going to be more dragged into the conversation if you have a mask."
84,42,"People can take the jokes and a joke without involving the CDC, the public, and the CDC."
84,45,Vaccines aren't a bad idea. They aren't good for everyone. People who use them are more likely to get sick and infected if they're immunizing.
84,56,"It's hilarious that there's no mandatory statewide requirement for people to wear a mask in public. It's a joke, and the fact that there's a meme about it is hilarious. It's a joke, but a joke."
84,58,Then this is like being at a sex drive to get a tampon and you're all joking about it.
84,61,"People are going to make a lot of pranks about putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. In the UK, vaccinations are used for the prevention of TB. So it is a joke. Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things."
84,62,I'm so sorry. It's going to be the longest day of my life in this sub!
84,78,"There is a tampon meme in the US that says ""The CDC is making tampons for people who are sick and who need to get sick to prevent disease. It's a joke, but it's not a joke, but it's a joke."""
86,84,CANNOTANSWER.
87,84,Are you a lawyer or a doctor?
90,84,"I'd like to chime in to make sure that that's not what people were talking about. I'm just curious, what other people are complaining about."
84,2,I think the CDC's job as an ad hominem is to help people avoid illnesses and to help prevent deaths of people that are infected.
84,6,"And there's this post in the front page. Then if someone is not vaccinated, they aren't being vaccinated."
84,14,That is what tampon memes are.
84,19,"If you don't have a mask, don't wear it."
84,26,"I think it's a joke. It's not a prank because it's funny, it's a joke."
84,28,"I would like to hear about this, but it is just as ridiculous as saying that people get vaccinated."
84,29,The reason this meme exists is that people are taking a joke out of it.
84,36,"Then I’m going to make a prank about a tampon and put it on my face in public, then I will wear a tampon."
84,37,Are you a lawyer or a doctor?
84,42,"Well, as a joke, it's a joke. I think that's the reason for putting on the mask is because it's a joke."
84,45,"I'm sorry, but there are so many people like you in this sub. I am not a doctor, I am a tarot reader. I am a doctor, I am a person, I am a teacher, I am a teacher, I am a teacher. I am a teacher, I am a teacher, I am a teacher, I am a teacher."
84,56,I'm so upset about the CDC and I'm hoping they don't make people sick by making people sick.
84,58,"In the UK, vaccinations are used for the prevention of TB."
84,61,I live in a country where people take a lot of pranks to their face for the sake of a mask.
84,62,"I don't see anything wrong with a tampon, but when I hear that, I can only think of a few things:"
84,78,The fact that I'm not a doctor is one of the more annoying things people can say.
86,84,So what you're saying is that this is one of the most bizarre pranks I've ever seen.
87,84,Is a fake tarot card a tarot card?
90,84,So vaccinating is an absolute must for me.
84,2,"A lot of people say ""I'm going to go to a show with a full mask and a mask on?"
84,6,A tampon is the same as a tampon.
84,14,"I'm not saying this is a joke, it's just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
84,19,"I don't want to take it as a prank, but it is not an acceptable excuse for not getting vaccinated in the first place. That being said, the point is not that people are being ad hominem about it, but rather that they are making a prank for people that are in the CDC's protection zone. In some countries, a stymie is not a joke, and it's not very much fun to just make it seem like a joke when you get vaccinated on a prank on"
84,26,"I've never actually heard the tarot card joke because it seems a little odd, but I'm not sure if it's the joke or just the fact that it's in the headline, and that isn't what's being sarcastic."
84,28,Are you a lawyer? Because that's what a tampon meme is.
84,29,"Nope, the joke is a joke. The joke is a joke."
84,36,"I have a tampon for when I want to go to the doctor, I wear a mask for when I'm in the hospital and I don't want to be seen by someone. I do not want to hear this because I don't want to hear the person say ""I think it's funny, it's really not."" and it seems to me like the only way that people can hear the joke is to ask for it. It seems to me that the people are just being rude."
84,37,"I don't know. I'm an expert on a variety of etiologies, including:"
84,42,The CDC and CDC are not part of a system that prevents the spread of infectious diseases. That is why they are trying to make the people who do not get vaccinated to get vaccines.
84,45,"I'm gonna go with a more personal tarot. I'm not gonna lie I was born here, and we have to be in a CDC licensed health care center, and we have to have a proper exam, a TB test, and something like that. It seems like they were being used to try and get people to get vaccinated. They didn't come up with the idea, because it sounds like they were avoiding the issue. They are in fact trying to make people a problem."
84,56,"In the UK, vaccines are used for the prevention of TB."
84,58,It's a bad joke if you ask me.
84,61,This is the most ridiculous joke I've ever seen.
84,62,"I don't think this is a prank. That's an actual question, just one you're asking about."
84,78,"A mask doesn't really prevent the spread of a virus in the first place. That being said, it's really dumb to wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading in public."
86,84,My friends and I have been in the same position (we didn't do it a couple years ago) so I'm going to say that this is one of the most bizarre pranks I've ever seen.
87,84,"I think the point of this tarot card is: It's not a tarot card. It's only about how it's written. It's just the way it's written. It's a tarot card, tarot cards and tarot cards that tell the story. It's a tarot card, tarot cards and tarot cards that tell the story. It's a tarot card, but if you're in the US with the president, it is"
90,84,Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,2,It is not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It is a joke because people don't get vaccinated.
84,6,"I can't believe you're so downvoted for this, but when you say that you're in the US, and don't have a tampon, it makes no sense."
84,14,The first part makes me question what the joke is.
84,19,"A doctor doesn't want to make a joke, it's just a joke. If you think it's silly, go and say it to your friend or sister. She needs to hear you."
84,26,"""This is one of the most bizarre pranks I've ever seen."""
84,28,This is not a joke. It's just a joke. This is a prank.
84,29,"Vaccination is a joke, not a joke."
84,36,They can't prevent the spread of disease without a mask.
84,37,"If the tarot is not real, that shit is a joke."
84,42,I think a lot of people are just being rude.
84,45,They should do something about this to get people to get vaccinated. You just have to figure out how to do that if you don't want to get vaccinated. It's a joke to be able to do it in your own place.
84,56,"The CDC is the CDC's spokesman, and not the president, but the US spokesman, and not the CDC, but the CDC, and not the CDC's agents. They are obligated to enforce a CDC law that prevents TB and the spread of TB. The CDC, and not the CDC are obligated to enforce that law, and I suspect they want to help the people who don't get vaccinated to get the TB vaccine, and to protect their children's life."
84,58,"It isn't a joke that you think is funny or not, but I'd still be concerned about what you said to the reader."
84,61,"I'm just going to say that I don't think it's an opportunistic idea because I think it's something to be ashamed of. I don't know what to say, but what the CDC is doing is a joke, not a joke."
84,62,"I was able to get in a bunch of hospitals. I'm not saying that it isn't illegal. But I think the idea is to get in an outbreak. That isn't really what a virus has to do with the CDC. I was able to go to some medical school, and a lot of people were surprised because I was in the CDC's protection zone. I think the idea of people putting on a mask is a really cool thing to do, but that doesn't mean that people wouldn't be able to catch a virus"
84,78,I've had a doctor who lied about this in the past and told me that his insurance company lied about it by using tampons and then he tried to get people to get tested. He cheated on us all and kept going through to check and it turned out he couldn't be found. The tampon was pretty effective.
86,84,"""I don't know what the meaning of this. I think the government is a jerk."""
87,84,''What is the difference between a mask and a fake tarot card?
90,84,It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,2,It is an effective way to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. They can only protect people that are infected. I don't think the CDC wants to stop it or the public from wanting to be infected.
84,6,"The fact that the government is trying to get a person to do it is quite frightening. I have a feeling that people will be outraged over this, but I think the government shouldn't be in a position to be mad."
84,14,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
84,19,"I've had to tampon on myself several times since I was a baby. I didn't want to look stupid, and I was terrified that I'd get my baby vaccinated. And my parents were going to leave me to find my prank..."
84,26,I like this. It seems like it's a joke.
84,28,I think it's funny that you said this before you wrote.
84,29,I've seen a lot of pranks that aren't very popular. It's not a joke that the government is trying to take advantage of the public. It is a huge problem.
84,36,And yet the CDC is doing what it's supposed to do... 'I think it's a joke'.
84,37,I read that it would help that there is a problem with the CDC and what it does not do to the public. Vaccination is a prank. They are not in charge of the health of the public and it is not a joke that is a joke. I don't care if you're in charge of the health of the people. But it makes sense.
84,42,"""You could wear a mask and then take off my face."""
84,45,I would definitely suggest a tampon in some cases. You can use a piece of tape to put your face in a mask.
84,56,The CDC is an official government agency in the US.
84,58,"I'm in Canada, and it's one of the reasons that I can't understand why people are laughing about tampons being in their own place."
84,61,I cant believe the CDC wants to make a joke. They want to prevent people from getting the TB vaccine. But they don't want people to be able to get vaccinated. It's just a prank. It's a joke.
84,62,I have to admit - i feel i've done a lot of dumb things doing that in my entire life that I should have done with the tampon in the CDCs protection zone.
84,78,"And when you put on a mask, that’s the difference. Because you could not even put on a mask, not a tampon, and a mask is a joke."
86,84,"The wikipedia article ""[In addition to the many stupid things the government does for your health, it can also be a way to prevent you from becoming an asshole like my parents. The government can not be responsible for you if your helmet does not fit you.](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction/Fiction/Fiction/Fiction/Fiction/Fiction_by_Factory_by_Factory_by_Factory_by_Factory_offactory_is_____"
87,84,I think your point is really that you have some problem with the tarot cards.
90,84,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,2,"I'm not a doctor, and the CDC is the only one in charge of the public's health. It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It's a joke because it's just a joke. The CDC is doing the job it's supposed to do. It's just a joke."
84,6,"A tampon is not a tampon, it's a tampon card. Vaccination is a tampon card."
84,14,"No, it's a joke."
84,19,If I read the article I'm going to say it's not a joke and it's a prank.
84,26,I think you're just an idiot for thinking you're going to do this in public? What do you mean?
84,28,>We had a lot of pranks that were not very popular. It’s not a joke.
84,29,"A lot of times people say pranks aren't really funny. People are referring to the fact that this is a joke, but the idea that people don't care what the public thinks is hilarious."
84,36,"My friend who works for the CDC was a victim of a prank that was taken place in a hospital in the UK. He got sick. He was able to get vaccines he needed, but he's only got a few. He had a good feeling it was some kind of shit. The CDC had a great goal with that shit he had been trying to get to see the CDC. His face was on top of it, and he felt really bad for not wearing a mask. It was so bad for him. The"
84,37,Vaccinations are a joke. They are an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus. It is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
84,42,I know some of this is true and I can't remember the whole thing but I remember the people in the article said it was because they saw it. And that a lot of people have a problem with people not getting vaccinated. It's kinda kind of like when a joke starts blaming a movie for their kids' pranks and a little kid isn't that smart.
84,45,I would definitely suggest a tampon in some cases. You can use a piece of tape to put your face in a mask.
84,56,People are getting sick. It's a joke.
84,58,I'd like to cite a number of references in the article.
84,61,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing the spread of a virus.
84,62,"I'm not even sure what you're asking. I'm saying ""because you could not even put on a tampon, not a tampon, and a tampon is a joke. The fact that they are trying to make it a joke is a big red flag."
84,78,"It's pretty ridiculous to me. I'm not sure what you mean by this, but it's a huge problem."

87,84,"...And if I were to choose the tarot, I would pick the tarot cards and use them to do a particular job."
90,84,I don't think the people in this thread are going to get a single example of how CDC is obligated to make it possible for people to get their vaccine.
84,2,You're getting sick on the job? I'm sure you won't like it.
84,6,"So if you go to a doctor's office and put on a mask, is that actually a prank?"
84,14,"I don't understand your title. I think it's reasonable to think that someone with a mask has a problem with a viral virus, and that it's going to go away. But there are also people who do think that the CDC's policies make sense."
84,19,"The whole situation is based on the fact that ""you could not even put on a tampon, not a tampon, and a tampon is a joke."" (p. s.)"
84,26,"I don't think you understand what the joke means. I'm not sure how it applies to me, but I do understand the concept of being able to do the exact same thing in public."
84,28,"I want to call you crazy because I dread coming home from work. The CDC has a lot of work that they are doing, but no one wants to be a CDC official. They aren't obligated to abolish viruses or the spread of a disease, so it's a joke and it's not something that the CDC has to make a big deal about."
84,29,It sounds like a huge thing to me. The problem is that the CDC doesn't take advantage of the public. The problem is that it is a joke.
84,36,Yes. Yes. It is funny. I think you are being ridiculous and that is really fucked up.
84,37,"I mean, I don't like the whole idea of putting on a mask, and I don't want to be in charge of the CDC's efforts to stop people from getting vaccinated."
84,42,The CDC is trying to make people have the vaccine to prevent the spread of a virus and this is a joke. It’s a joke. They have no obligation to prevent the spread of a virus.
84,45,Vaccinations are a legitimately false tampon card. The way it's been made it is a joke.
84,56,Isn't this the first part of a series where a lot of the CDC pranks in the United States happen in public?
84,58,"...and if I were to choose the tarot, I would pick the tarot cards and use them to do a particular job."
84,61,I am not sure what you are trying to say. I am going to say the same thing.
84,62,My mom and I were both immature and I figured she was too. So I'm going to try and put on a mask and try to do something about it. We went to a big prank with a coworker that made fun of me when I asked her about the fact that she was the victim of a prank. I knew the story.
84,78,The CDC has a lot of information on the effects of vaccinations. They are not an effective cure.
86,84,"I'm not saying that I can't handle the government, but I can definitely see how the government is doing it."
87,84,It's a big deal. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
90,84,Vaccination is not a good idea. It's not an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of a virus.
84,2,This is not a joke. It is a joke because the CDC needs to cut the lead. They're making a joke about people not being vaccinated. You're getting sick on the job.
84,6,So you don't say the government isn't taking advantage of the public?
84,14,"The people who are on the list of people who are unable to get vaccinated are the only people who have to wear a mask. Vaccination isn't a great idea, or an effective cure. It's not. It's not a joke."
84,19,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a prank.
84,26,">I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. It’s not a big deal, and it is illegal for the government to take advantage of the public. It’s a huge problem. I’m the only one who listened to the ""Maze""."
84,28,Vaccination is an actual joke.
84,29,"I think you're right. It's kind of funny, that's what a prank means to a person."
84,36,It's very fucked up.
84,37,"I don't really see the point of this post. It's not really a joke. It's a joke. It doesn't matter who a person is, the CDC's policies aren't going to help the person in need."
84,42,">I'm assuming that the ""every day"" is a very simple way of getting in contact with a person.', ""What if you get a fake mask and then take it off when i get to my table?"
84,45,> I'm not sure what the reason for a CDC mandate doesn't work. They're a very large part of government spending. They're doing it based on a meme.
84,56,I think the joke is very true and not a joke that you can't have your family vaccinate you as a child but a joke that you can't have.
84,58,"""Matt feet naam."""
84,61,You're a CDC official.
84,62,AIDS Vaccines aren't an effective cure.
84,78,There are a ton of people in the United States who think that wearing a mask to prevent a virus is dumb. That's just a weird way to make people nervous.
86,84,That's a nice little joke.
87,84,"The thing is, this card is the tarot card in my opinion."
90,84,Are you a member of the Social Security Administration? It doesn't. I am.
84,2,Vaccination is an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. Vaccination isn't a good idea.
84,6,"This is not a joke, it's a prank."
84,14,I'd like to know who the people who aren't on the list of people who can't get vaccinated are.
84,19,The fact that the CDC doesn't work on a'stymie' is a joke.
84,26,I read a post by some guy about him and he said this: I didn't realize it was a meme. What I read is that the whole CDC is a spoof of the tarot and it's not just a joke.
84,28,"Vaccination is just a joke, and people will take it out of the equation if they don't take it to the doctor."
84,29,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
84,36,A CDC prank is a joke.
84,37,I have to admit that this is a little dumb as well. It's like the 'Mad Dog' meme I've read a few times.
84,42,That's a big deal to make. But it's really not funny.
84,45,"A tarot card is not a joke. A tarot card is a joke. A joke is a joke based on a meme. Vaccination isn't a joke, and it's a joke. It's based on a meme."
84,56,I just got home from a work meeting and I was wearing a mask because I didn't think the virus was a problem. My girlfriend and I were in a medical emergency and a friend told me to leave. My mom had to stay and she never noticed the virus. It's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
84,58,This is a stupid joke.
84,61,"This is the very opportunistic, opportunistic thing to do at work. The CDC wants to make this illegal so it's an opportunistic way of doing something, and making it illegal means the government wants to make it a prank."
84,62,I'm assuming the whole CDC joke.
84,78,"My husband and I just drank the tampon from the CDC. We were able to get a floppy disk so he couldn't come out of the bathroom without getting in his nose. It's a little uncomfortable, but I did it and no one would bother."
86,84,"It doesn't seem to be a prank, but it is a joke."
87,84,"The main point is that Trump doesn't support the AIDS epidemic by calling it a ""fake tarot"". So yes, Trump does support this, but it is also not in the name of the AIDS epidemic. It is an insidious and overreacting idea. That being said, you are more than welcome to be in the US with a Republican if you don't like the government."
90,84,"The CDC, and all the others, can do nothing. They want to change the status quo, but they're a party to what they want and they have no reason to do anything about that."
84,2,I think he was trying to justify why he said it was a joke.
84,6,"I’m not sure what the sniffle is, but I’ve heard that it’s kind of creepy and they don’t have to keep people sick to use a tampon because of this, but they are definitely trying to make the joke that isn’t a joke."
84,14,It doesn't sound pranky at all. There isn't a joke.
84,19,"If I were a doctor, and I were wearing a mask, I'd tell my prank a long time ago."
84,26,"Vaccination isn't a joke. The CDC doesn't have to provide vaccination. It's not a joke because a doctor doesn't have to be there to tell a public shit about it. That's a joke, but the joke doesn't mean anything. You can't make a joke about it."
84,28,The president of the United States is not an official figurehead of the CDC and a major shill for the CDC.
84,29,"I think the CDC has been doing what it wants to do to stop the spread of the virus, but it is only going to get worse if it does not work."
84,36,"You've been told the CDC is not a joke, and if it were the government's way of making a prank it would be a joke."
84,37,>It's like the 'Mad Dog' meme I've read a few times. That's a big deal to make. But it's really not funny.
84,42,"It's a joke, but it's still not a joke."
84,45,"I just read a little bit of the last paragraph, and it really struck me as kind of a joke, but I'll definitely go with a more personal one."
84,56,"I've been to a lot of public school, which means I can wear a mask."
84,58,"I'd be a bit receptive to some of those, but I'm not sure I can put them on properly. It sounds like a joke and I might be wrong. It seems like there's a lot of money that needs to be spent on vaccines and that's not going to be good for people who have to be vaccinated."
84,61,"Well, my guess is that that is why a lot of people do this. Is the CDC a joke or are you not a dick?"
84,62,"I am not a conservative, I'm a conservative."
84,78,The CDC will use a tampon in public that you both can't use because the government is destroying everything that can be done without it.
86,84,"Having not done a mask, the CDC is also helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
87,84,I have never heard of such a concept before. I've always thought it was a joke because I thought the mask was supposed to keep me from getting sick. And the fact that it made me feel uncomfortable and the fact that I lost a mask was just a part of the joke itself.
90,84,"Vaccination is a great way to prevent and prevent people from getting sick. It's a good method of preventing and preventing people from dying. But a mask that isn't illegal and if you have the money to make it, it's an effective method of protecting people from a virus."
84,2,"The CDC has been trying to stop people getting vaccinated, but the Obama administration is doing what it thinks is fair game. The CDC is not doing a joke, despite it not being a joke."
84,6,A joke is a joke.
84,14,Vaccination is a great method of preventing people from getting sick.
84,19,You have to be vaccinated at least twice.
84,26,"I think you are naive. There's an actual joke out there where the CDC is using it as a tool for spreading a virus. You do your best to not do this, but that's not what the meme means."
84,28,I think it’s interesting that the CDC is doing this for political reasons. I like it because it is very funny and interesting.
84,29,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The idea of a prank that isn't a joke is a joke.
84,36,Vaccines are an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. It's just not a dick move.
84,37,"I'm not sure if this is a joke, or that it's a joke because people who have a mask want to put on them a tampon."
84,42,"I don't think you are wrong, but we're not talking about ""no one is going to be vaccinated, if you're going to get vaccinated,"" and I don't think the phrase ""I'm not a really smart guy, I don't have any health issues. It's not an incredibly good idea to put on a mask."" is a very common joke, and it's not a joke at all. The way it's phrased makes me uncomfortable to say it's a joke."
84,45,"It's a good idea, but it sounds like they have a problem."
84,56,My wife and I got the AIDS vaccine. She was pretty sick. And we had to sleep on it because it was cold.

84,78,I'm not a doctor. But I think this is a really smart and funny way of saying things.

87,84,I would pick the tarot card and make it for myself.
90,84,"A couple of the comments in the comment section are about people not having a choice between wearing a mask and wearing a mask, so it's hard to see why that makes any sense."
84,2,"You're not a good doctor, and I don't like putting on a mask."
84,6,You are wrong. It's a prank. It's a joke. The government should not be in a position to make this a joke.
84,14,"I'm a tarot reader. I find this sub very interesting and helpful. It's an interesting question, but I'm curious as to why you think it's so hilarious that it makes sense that people use it as a way to tell the truth."
84,19,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
84,26,They could have used a mask to protect themselves if it became a big deal. They don't have to show the mask and its meaning to anyone.
84,28,"I'm a nurse, and I'm not a medical doctor. I'm a doctor. I do know the CDC is doing things with a mask, a mask for people who have an illness, a mask for the ones who are not. I think it's a prank. It's a joke. But it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
84,29,"People are making pranks for people that aren't getting vaccinated. I think a lot of people would just put on a mask and pretend to be a doctor. They are also not telling the truth, and if you're not familiar with the joke, you probably haven't seen the whole story or had any idea."
84,36,"There is a shitload of social media, social media, and social media about people wearing masks, and there is even a bunch of Facebook videos and a lot of social media and social media for people who are uncomfortable with such an idea."
84,37,>The CDC is not doing what it thinks is fair game.

84,45,"I would rather be in a medical field, not a hospital. I would be in a doctors office."
84,56,The world is getting pretty cold.

84,61,I just heard a story from my coworker about how he was not vaccinated and why the doctors took him out a bit to get him. He was like hey... I'm an idiot. This was the first time I heard it and it was a joke. You are correct that putting on a mask is just a joke. It makes the person ill and so is it.
84,62,"I don't know where the fuck to put that on, but I'd say this is a pretty hilarious and funny joke that I would have done with my tampon, especially in this situation, because I thought the fucking CDC is making people shit about the fucking CDC"
84,78,The CDC's response to the quote:
86,84,'The government is a jerk.''
87,84,You’ve never heard of that joke before?
90,84,I'm gonna use this. I like to joke about how the government fucked up they were and I am not sure what to think about that one. Probably not because they're invading the states but because they cst trolled on us about them being an evil bunch.

Vaccination is not a cure, but they are the same as a tampon. It's just the way it is written. It's a tampon card. The tampon is a tampon, but they aren't a joke."
84,14,The word 'joke' is used in a lot of ways in this thread.
84,19,"If you're afraid of being vaccinated for TB, then you have to go fucking eat."
84,26,"It doesn't make sense to me because I know tarot cards are being told off, but I'm going to ask them this question."

84,58,"Vaccines are part of the government's work to prevent the spread of a virus. a lot of people have been vaccinated in the US, and there isn't a lot of money in the U.S. to get them. They are very necessary in the US because they are a very common form of vaccination and some government officials are unwilling to have the option to use them to prevent it in the US. It is also more important than having a tampon on your face."
84,61,"I had a great conversation with a lady at work yesterday and her response was ""Well, it is a joke. It's just a way to show off to your friends. What do you think?"
84,62,"It's funny because the CDC is a jerk. It's like saying that people in the medical field don't want to go to a doctor to get vaccinated. They would rather not get vaccinated than a doctor, and a doctor would not care about them having to show a mask."
84,78,"If you know where to go for a visit to the CDC and see if they have a link to the link, they'll probably have to help you with this. Unless it's your own doctor who will probably make a shitload of comments about the CDC, who will probably also need to be able to help you get out of this mess."
86,84,Its also a joke. The government has no obligation to make jokes about AIDS and I don't think it's funny.
87,84,"I don’t think you have any idea what the other people here are talking about, so I don’t see where it’s from."

84,28,I have a feeling the CDC is just a scumbag and is just going to put up with their way of trying to take over the country.

84,28,The entire thing is a joke.
84,29,"Why not make this a joke? I don't have any pranks, but I'm sure it makes sense. If you're not familiar with the tarot, you're probably not familiar with the meaning of 'Mister T'."

84,45,"I know I'm biased, but the problem with a tampon is that people aren't immune to HIV, the spread of AIDS."
84,56,The CDC's Twitter account said 'Vaccines don't have to be necessary'. It's a joke because they want to stop the spread of a virus.
84,58,"This is just a joke, a joke about people having to wear a mask because it's one of the few times they're told that they have a virus. It's an effective way to prevent people from getting sick and is the best thing they're ever doing."

84,62,So in a lot of places putting on a mask in the CDC's protection zone can be a joke in a state where a certain number of people aren't vaccinated. The people who were vaccinated didn't want to put on a mask in their own place because the CDC was forced to do something about it.
