95,62,"The first time a person wears a mask it gets really funny. I know if they resign and coach a coach after it tries to put on a mask, then they're just a guy who's a little too old for a regular hockey team."

87,62,>We rescinded the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
90,62,I am not a government official. But I know that you may be unable to work without a mask.
95,62,Then they're not as much a team as the players.

62,3,"...and the government did something about it, and didn't do anything about it."
62,14,"No, I don't."
62,19,A mask is not a required part of a mask. It is a requirement for protection against the spread of a virus that is required to be vaccinated.

69,62,I was told that a mask is necessary for being vaccinated and that that has nothing to do with anything. I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask actually count if you are a doctor?
75,62,"So in your case, you're going to get a new one? This is an excellent time to let your sister know that you don't like wearing a mask and that you don't have to change your mask to prevent a change in her dick unless she is vaccinated, or at least not a change in her mask in order to protect herself."
79,62,I'm afraid...I've never done it.
80,62,"The fact that you're a black woman is very worrying. It's just that this is a scam. It doesn't come off as ""cosplay,"" it's an ad campaign."
84,62,The idea is that the people are actually responsible for the spread of a virus. You just want to make sure that you are in the right to do this.
87,62,"I like the idea of getting a ""face mask"" to keep the people out of the public eye, and then a ""fuck it! Stop it!"" quote."
90,62,I can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine. I'm a vaccinated person and I can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine.
95,62,The government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. But they are.

62,37,I'd be ok with a mask.
62,38,"I am not a government official. I know that you are unaffected by the situation, and that's a legitimate reason to not wear a mask. The fact that you are a black woman is very worrying. I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask actually count if you are a doctor? So in your case, you're going to get a new one?"
62,39,There's nothing on 'the mask is what you get for being a doctor'. It's just a joke.
69,62,"It's not a mandate to wear a mask, it's a mandate."
75,62,"This guy is just a really pathetic and pathetic person. And the other guys are like, ""I'm gonna call you a twitch euphemism. My face isn't a twitch euphemism...sorry. I'm afraid it's not, or I'm just too young."""

84,62,They aren't immune to a virus and it isn't even remotely a symptom of an illness.

90,62,"The quote is from ""...a lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."""
95,62,What a ridiculous joke. You don't need a mask to play hockey. Your body is not at risk of developing this virus.
96,62,This is a terrible comment.
62,3,The whole joke was nonsense.

62,19,"People wear a mask to protect themselves from being vaccinated and unless they're allergic to the virus, they aren't going to be able to get vaccinated. I think that mask is necessary for protection against HIV/AIDS."

62,38,"I thought this was about the government, not the twitchcon euphemism."
62,39,Is there any difference between having a mask and not wearing a mask?
69,62,"Vaccination is required for everyone in all the states, but that's all. I don't think people have a problem with that."
75,62,I can only imagine what people would be like when they're blown up by something that makes them uncomfortable.
79,62,I don't care what they say about the masked word. What they are saying is you are talking about a mask.

62,14,This is one of the only jokes I see from the last two years:
62,19,"I just want to tell you this: The people that aren't vaccinated do have to wear a mask to protect themselves. And the people that haven't have it don't. It's a bad idea to make a joke out of it. But it's a terrible joke, that's why they don't wear it."
62,37,"It's not really a joke, it's a joke and it's not about the government."
62,38,It sounds like the best possible thing to do for the US.
62,39,It was posted a few times on social media and reeked of the people who don't even know what a mask is.

62,19,"A friend of mine just told me that if I want to see a tarot card that goes with my AIDS, I need to do a little bit of a face mask to protect myself."
62,37,The only person I'd want to get on board with would be someone who was in his mid-30s. There are still jokes on the internet.
62,38,"There is a joke on reddit called the ""Men Have a Mask"" that people need to wear to get the vaccine because they're a politician who is sick of being vaccinated and not a doctor. That's a joke on the social medias."

80,62,This is the top comment on this sub. What's the point of using this sub?
84,62,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's not illegal. It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. It isn't an opportunistic idea. This is a reality check about people. The problem is that you’re not vaccinated for an illness in public. It’s not a huge deal. It’s just a dick move. I think it’s a big deal.
87,62,"The first two statements were 'I don't like the government', and the last was 'I don't like the government."
90,62,I don't think there are many people who would be able to afford to take a mask for a medical care because they didn't know about the vaccine.
95,62,"I don't know how to tell you exactly why a mask is not a problem. Its just a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. I am not a doctor so he just tells me ""It's a joke"""
96,62,You're getting real sick and tired of this. I've seen so many jokes about it. People use masks for their own sake.
62,3,"You don't have to wear a mask because you're in a sick state, and you can't help to be sick, but you're on a state level health plan. If you can't get vaccines, don't get vaccinated, or your state's health board can't let you do any of their work for you."
62,14,It's an absolutely ridiculous joke. You are just being a little over the top in your comment.
62,19,I think that it is a pretty stupid joke but I have heard that a lot of people are just really stupid about it and are very upset that people are not vaccinated.
62,37,A tarot card has been a joke for some time. It's so silly it doesn't work because there's a huge difference between a person vaccinated for an illness and someone with the AIDS vaccine who was born in a country with a poor public health system.

79,62,"No, it's based on a condition called pneumonia. It is not a medical condition. It's not a vaccine, it's not a disease."
80,62,He's a black woman. The government tries to sell AIDS vaccines to minors. I believe a lot of people are getting the AIDS vaccine. It's a scam because he doesn't believe it's a scam.
84,62,"A doctor and a nurse are both not vaccinated. They're not able to tell if an illness is infected in a public setting, and are only forced to cover the symptoms of an illness by a doctor."
87,62,I think the tarot card is an obnoxious thing to wear because it is an attempt to stop the spread of AIDS. I'm sure that will be enough of a troll to get someone to get his face flung on and make it seem as if they are doing it for the public benefit.
90,62,I think you are missing the point.
95,62,I think you're joking. What is this joke that got me to the end of this thread?
96,62,"I think it's a joke, but I don't really see why you think that people wear masks for sex, and don't understand that sex is just a joke."
62,3,Vaccination is an important part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It’s not illegal. It’s not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. It’s just a dick move. I think it’s a big deal.
62,14,I don't like the government. I'd say the mask is an important thing to do.
62,19,They don't want to nitpick the 'no masks' thing because they don't feel like they have a real right to do something or they do something that will actually cause them to nitpick on other people. The people I know who wear masks for sex are the ones who are being told to get vaccinated.
62,37,"He's a little over the top, but he can really be a jerk about the tarot card."

75,62,I'm pretty sure it's a joke.
79,62,CANNOTANSWER – a doctor will be on your side with a virus. If you can't get it out of the way.
80,62,I’m surprised they don’t have any of the best political debates coming up here - one that’s actually been talked about so much on here (not a single thread for this one)
84,62,I feel like the people on this sub are a little too immature. But the fact that it is an important part of the CDC is a big red flag.
87,62,I was wondering if I was the only one who had a tarot card and read about the AIDS epidemic.
90,62,There aren't many things a person can afford to take care of. The government is just getting to know people.
95,62,A CDC joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
96,62,"The way I find it, I’m surprised the response here isn’t a lot of karma. It’s one of the best ad hominem jokes I’ve seen on here."
62,3,"Unless the person's medical condition is very severe, it's hard to do any sort of treatment at all, even if it's just to prevent the spread of a virus. It's probably a great idea for a doctor to be infected."
62,14,It’s just one of those weird stuff that gets posted by people who don’t like the joke oh man.
62,19,"My mom used to wear tarot cards during the AIDS epidemic to prevent AIDS. Her husband was actually vaccinated with an HIV virus. The first year she tried to vaccinate, she came to the conclusion that she was a dangerous person. The CDC has put a lot of weight on it. I hope you are still vaccinated."
62,37,"I'm not saying it's a joke, I'm saying that it's not a joke."
62,38,"If you like to joke about the government, you can't even write a sarcastic, sarcastic hat. The only people who are able to make it seem like they're joking is people who haven't been informed before - the public and the government - and that's just a joke."
62,39,">I don't really understand why you think that people wear masks for sex, and don't understand that sex is just a joke."
69,62,- and also this is a slang term.
75,62,I've always been attracted to these people because they're the best euphemism for a tarot deck. I'm always trying to figure out what people are up to when they go into a conversation without a doctor. I'm always curious how people actually feel when I see people in a tarot deck.
79,62,A lot of it is wrong and a good part of it is a misconception.
80,62,Apparently the President lied to the public that the government was not involved in the vaccine sales. They are making money off of this.
84,62,'Feeling a mask through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i
87,62,"tarot card is a card that says that if a tarot deck is made of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
90,62,"Well, this is a new meme that I think is actually very interesting. Is there any particular example of a meme that would be a meme that doesn't really belong in the meme thread?"
95,62,It's a joke. The whole thing is a joke. A CDC joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
96,62,I don’t think you have the right to take it to someone who is a doctor or a doctor who has a virus. That’s not a joke at all. I think this is the way to go.
62,3,"[Women wear masks for sex and sex are considered to be serious health threats, but sex and sex are a form of protection](http://www.socb.gov/ethics/whatever_as-asia-virus/)."
62,14,It's a joke.
62,19,>I’ve always been attracted to these people because they’re the best euphemism for a tarot deck.
62,37,"A lot of the jokes are about the government's inability to stop the spread of a disease, so the jokes are about people being ill or getting a lot of sick, or even just being able to control their own medical progress."
62,38,"I'm going to be incredibly pissed off if I'm getting offended, as an individual. But my mom had to wear a mask, to prevent HIV/AIDS. But she figured that she was infected."
62,39,You don't know where this tarot card came from?
69,62,It isn't a joke. This is a joke. It is not a joke.
75,62,"There is no such thing as ""twitch"" in the US."
79,62,"OP, my friend is a nurse who is a physician who uses a mask. It smothers everyone in the room."
80,62,"...I'm still angry at the US and my wife for telling me ""I can't keep in contact with my family, but I can help you and if I do I will tell you that you can help me out."""
84,62,"I think a bit of the ""Meme of the day"" joke is about the people with a mask being put on their face and then taking it off when the CDC can't make that happen."
87,62,"The other side of the story is more about the government doing a tarot card trick, or at least that part of the trick."
90,62,Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a large part of government spending. They're doing it based on a meme.
95,62,If the CDC were putting on the masks it'd be the CDC's fault.
96,62,... and then tell them it's a joke about it and makes them think it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
62,3,"No, the US government has nothing to worry about. I'm more concerned about the people wearing masks being in danger, than it is about their health."
62,14,It is in no way a joke. It is a joke.
62,19,It sounds like they just suck.
62,37,... [the CDC is a joke](http://www.socb.gov/ethics/whatever_as-asia-virus/).
62,38,"Then, what is the joke about being a woman and allowing her to be a doctor?"
62,39,Vaccines and a tarot aren't the same thing unless you have a different tarot card. So I don't have the right to know what is a tarot card.

75,62,"As a Canadian citizen, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments."
79,62,I'm a nurse. I wear a mask because I know I want to.
80,62,I'm not so sure it’s not a scam. The CDC’s involvement in the HIV vaccine was hugely significant.
84,62,People on this sub are crazy and mean and not in the most appropriate way. So they do something for fun and a joke.
87,62,"CANNOTANSWER: People should not wear tarot cards because they are fake.',"
90,62,The CDC is trying to cover up this.
95,62,"The jokes of the CDC have been downvoted for not being funny, but as I said to you: it's pretty much a joke."
96,62,"I always wear a mask every day. But not always and sometimes it's just a joke. I mean, the ad hominem jokes are really great, because it's very popular."
62,3,They are in no way fake. They are fake.
62,14,It is in no way a joke. It is a joke.
62,19,I’d wear a tarot card to protect myself because I know they won’t stop me.
62,37,I think we should be able to say that the joke of the CDC is actually very good. The reason that it's so popular is that they don't want to be in the headlines. But to me that isn't even a joke.
62,38,"A joke, the memes are so funny. The thing that made me laugh the most is that people wearing masks can easily come up to a fucking joke about the government and not the government. I mean, yeah, it’s fun, but I do like that the government does this and I hate that it’s a joke and not a joke."
62,39,"People who don't know what a tarot card is, who don't care, who don't wear a mask. The people that can."
69,62,They said it's a joke. And a lot of jokes about it are about the government not wanting to do something and you just said it.
75,62,"As a Canadian, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments."
79,62,a mask isn't a joke if it's not part of the effort to get sick people out.
80,62,[Women] is a CDC agent (aside from Ms Ingraham and the CDC).
84,62,The only reason people get on a sub is to pretend like they're being an asshole to people they don't like. And the CDC does it because the people who put on a mask aren't able to afford to go to a doctor.
87,62,Obama is the first person to explain his views.
90,62,"Well I feel you and I are going to have to rethink this a little more, I think I will just say, ""You can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine."". I'm going to say, ""I'm a vaccinatist with boosters and that's what I call it.""., ""I am not a vaccinatist with boosters."""
95,62,"AIDS has a lot to do with it. When the movie comes out, it makes the joke seem like it's a joke."
96,62,"""I love this part of the sub. It’s all about what people think. It’s all about what people think. Is it a 'joke' that the government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus? It’s not a joke."
62,3,"The US government is not going to act on that, because it is a joke."
62,14,The fact that a person does not know what a mask is and they have a fucking problem with it is more offensive than any of the other statements.
62,19,No mask is necessary for protection against HIV/AIDS. The fact that a mask is necessary is what made the CDC's comment so funny.
62,37,AIDS is a pretty popular and controversial disease and there is no other excuse for it. The reason the jokes are funny is that people who have been vaccinated do not know what a tarot card is.
62,38,I think a lot of people on here are in a place where they think they are just being stupid and that they should wear something funny.
62,39,What does a tarot card have to do with that?
69,62,"I'm not sure how anyone could be bothered by the ""I'm a joke"" or ""'I'm a joke"" joke. But I know how much it is funny, and so, it is insignificant. So, it's an absolute fact. I'm just going to hazard a guess."
75,62,"As someone with an unvaccinated HIV case (I would recommend it) it is extremely sexist to make people think they should be protected. The way you do this makes it a bit more relevant. I think the problem isn't that it can't be done in the short term, but that it's a better idea to cite a reputable source. I think the problem is that the ""false shady conspiracy"" to do it is the only way to do so."
79,62,If they do not prescribe a mask they will actually get rid of the virus and they will continue to do so because it will not be effective in stopping the spread of it.
80,62,“I’m still looking for a way to stop the spread of AIDS.
84,62,"""I feel like the people on this sub are crazy and mean and not in the most appropriate way. So they do something for fun and a joke."""
87,62,Then Trump could easily do something about this. It's not about 'everyone is in the right' but about everything.
90,62,This is a very popular meme to comment on. Vaccination is the first step in stopping the spread of a virus.It's also very popular in reddit. This is an interesting take on the problem.
95,62,"As the name implies, it's not a joke. This is a joke."
96,62,"I read this and it's funny because I'm a pretty big fan of r/government and when I go through them I can see a lot of sexist jokes, and I find it very difficult to keep them from being more specific to my own circumstances. I think this is funny but the jokes are not."
62,3,"The CDC has no idea what a mask is - they are just a joke - but they're a joke. CDC's point is not that they are not the real issue, but rather that the jokes are ridiculous."
62,14,"I think the joke is the very reason I'm posting on this sub, and I like it. It makes it sound like that's not a good reason at all."
62,19,Vaccination is the first step to preventing the spread of a virus. 'The CDC's comment is hilarious. It doesn't make any sense to me.
62,37,">I think the problem isn't that it can't be done in the short term, but that it is a better idea to cite a reputable source."

69,62,"Well, it sounds like there is a lot of shit on there."
75,62,...Then he goes on a rant about a scam and how they're sexy and uncool? And the guy has a meme about them. It's funny.
79,62,I don't think this is a joke...
80,62,Despite the fact that I'm from Texas.
84,62,"I'm really sorry to say this, but I don't think tampons are in any way intended to prevent people from getting AIDS. Vaccines are very important in the treatment of AIDS. It's the best way to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus."

62,14,I just read this on reddit. I really hate it.
62,19,>The CDC's comment is hilarious. It doesn't make any sense to me.
62,37,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
62,38,I would not wear a mask if my family was sick of being vaccinated and not the government.
62,39,"AIDS is a big issue here, and the one I read about that's the people who are in a bad position, and who do not care about their own sex life."
69,62,It's a joke and a joke. You say it's a joke and you don't think about it. It's just a joke.
75,62,You should not be bringing up the issue here. You're making it seem like you're asking for some advice.

84,62,"Why would I wear a mask if someone said no? I can see people do that, and it is a pretty funny thing for people to do, and I think I can do it for fun."
87,62,"If you look into the article it seems like the whole ""We need to stop the spread of AIDS!"" part of the story is that ""We don't need a tarot card"" is a joke because people are trying to stop it because the card is fake. ""The first two statements were 'I don't like the government', and the last was 'I don't like the government'."". and the other is the joke. ""The first two statements are 'I don't like the government.'"" and ""I think the tarot card"
90,62,"I am not a CDC official, but I will talk to a physician about this."
95,62,This isn't a joke at all. This is the joke that gets people talking about what a virus is.
96,62,"As far as I know, wearing a mask is not an appropriate joke. It's an extremely common and silly thing to do. I see many people using it for some reason and this is one of them. It's a joke because it's a funny thing to do. It makes no sense to try to go back and read the comments. I'm glad to see you've come out with a bit more understanding, but I think you have some serious lessons here."
62,3,"So many people have sexist and racist views, it's very clear that this is a joke."
62,14,"AIDS is not a joke - it is a tarot card. A fake tarot card is not a joke - it's a tarot card, not a tarot card. It doesn't mean the government is bad at stopping it, but it's a joke."
62,19,A person who doesn't wear a mask to help protect themselves is a jerk. A joke is funny. It's a joke because the person who isn't vaccinated can't really prevent someone from having an infection. The people who are not vaccinated have the very same problem as you.
62,37,The guy fucked up to a point in my life and he made a good point and then just got back on it and tried to bring it up again.

96,62,"""The thing that got me the most is that most people are narcissists that say the word hive is a joke. It’s pretty silly and racist."

62,19,"""That is a really good idea, but i want to say that it isn’t a joke."""
62,37,Is this the meme the meme about the CDC?
62,38,...that people need to wear a mask to get the vaccine.
62,39,"""Wild people are narcissists that say the word hive is a joke. It’s pretty silly and racist."
69,62,You're being sarcastic but I think this is the only sarcasm joke that is going on.
75,62,I think there is a problem here.

84,62,"The fact that there is a joke about it is very telling. In fact, I don't even see why people would be concerned about it, but that if it's a prank, it doesn't matter if it's a joke, it's the fact it's a meme."
87,62,I'm trying to figure out what's going on with the fake tarot deck and why it's a joke.
90,62,Vaccination is a great idea. It's a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a large part of government spending. They are working hard to change that and it isn't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working.
95,62,I can relate to that. I'm a doctor and my favorite thing about the CDC jokes is that it's not funny at all.
96,62,"I read the first sentence, but it's a little too sexist."
62,3,...but no one in my office wears a mask. It's not an issue. They are working hard to fix this. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working.
62,14,"> 'That is a really cool thing to do in a state where it's not really mandatory. For example, this kind of thing could happen to any person in a hospital where you are infected, and the CDC would need to do a pilot test for it if you want to vaccinate."

80,62,I have no idea what a scumbag or troll is but it sounds like a scam. It's not a scam because it's the worst thing in the world.

The doctor isn't a good guy and would be fine with the government putting on a mask to combat the spread of a virus. AIDS is a disease and they use it in their stomping parties. I don't think a good doctor would like that. The one and only part of it makes people think the government is a joke and the one and only part makes it even a joke"
96,62,It's a joke. I just find it very hard to keep them from being more specific to my own circumstances....and I think this is the way to go.'
62,3,">You don't have to wear a mask because you're in a sick state, and you can't help to be sick, but you're on a state's health board can't let you do any of their work for you."""
62,14,Is the tarot card a real tarot card? Because I'm not sure how to say.
62,19,I am not going to go into more detail but I was actually not vaccinated. The guy who got the virus was the only one. There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus.
62,37,I think the entire topic of the post is pretty funny:

84,62,"I was able to get in a bunch of hospitals. I'm not saying that it isn't illegal. But I think the idea is to get in an outbreak. That isn't really what a virus has to do with the CDC. I was able to go to some medical school, and a lot of people were surprised because I was in the CDC's protection zone. I think the idea of people putting on a mask is a really cool thing to do, but that doesn't mean that people wouldn't be able to catch a virus"
87,62,"It's a joke. 'If you don't want to die of the disease, you need a tarot card'."

62,38,"It's funny how people don't even think about it as a joke. They only know that the CDC is doing a joke to stop the spread of the disease, and that the government is getting a kick out of that joke. I can't even imagine the fact that you are a doctor. And it sounds like a lot of people are offended and I'm getting offended."
62,39,The joke of the CDC is that people don't wear a mask because it's a joke.

But I think there is no evidence that this is anything more than a scam based on this piece. This is not a CDC ad campaign. The CDC does not have a contract with CDC to sell a vaccine. The CDC also does not have an official contract with CDC. They have also tried to dismantle the CDC by selling a vaccine to patients, but they cannot stop it from being unemployed, and"
84,62,I have to admit - i feel i've done a lot of dumb things doing that in my entire life that I should have done with the tampon in the CDCs protection zone.
87,62,Those are all silly comments.

95,62,I can't imagine anything worse than putting on a mask to treat a very serious disease. It isn't the government's fault.
96,62,"In r/hives it's really difficult to say something like, ""No matter how good you get at it, you can never do it and I'm really surprised it's not a joke."" It's a little bit funny, but also pretty funny."

90,62,There are a lot of people who are trolls and do not understand the language used to express them.

84,62,My mom and I were both immature and I figured she was too. So I'm going to try and put on a mask and try to do something about it. We went to a big prank with a coworker that made fun of me when I asked her about the fact that she was the victim of a prank. I knew the story.
