54,45,"I've never seen a doctor put on a mask in front of someone, they can't even say a thing about the mask, and it's not like they've ever had a STI or anything like that, it's just a symptom of disease."
64,45,I'm afraid it is a scam to wear a mask for a period of time.

45,6,>A good coach will be the one whose responsibility is to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by a truck.
45,17,"Yes, you are the one whose responsibility is to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by a truck."
45,19,We can do better than that.
45,38,"It's really not inherently bad, inherently bad. It's not really bad."
45,39,In a previous sub I was a teacher and one of my students was a doctor. We were told that people who do not use masks can be a symptom of a disease.
54,45,"I think this is a very valid question. It's not your fault for not being comfortable wearing a mask, but for not wearing it."
64,45,>I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm afraid it is a scam to wear a mask for a period of time. Wearing a mask for a period of time.

89,45,"I have been wearing a mask the whole time, but it gets so annoying that I just want to wear a mask and get sick."

45,6,"I was a teacher at a psychiatric hospital, and I knew that wearing a mask might be a huge part of protecting your teammates. I remember putting on my mask when I went to my teacher's office to see how much more confident they would feel in a mask than a normal gf. I wore a mask during a conversation, and then the doctor said to him that the first thing he did when I asked for a correction was to use a mask."
45,17,I lost my first mask once. I don't think it was on purpose.
45,19,"This is why I love being a kid. You never need to wear a mask to protect your kids from a virus. And it seems that way to me, you don't need a mask."
45,38,"It's not bad to wear a mask, but it's a way to prevent it from spreading, and it can actually help prevent the spread of a virus. It's also a good way to prevent the spread of a virus in general."
45,39,"I would resign and not work with a guy who is not a team coach. It's pretty much a thing. As an american, I don't see how you would feel with a mask on."
54,45,"There is a song about that called ""Ripe."" It's on Netflix and it's just a song about an American girl getting tested and getting a vaccine."
64,45,"Yes, the CDC is one of the first countries to get on this list."
74,45,I love the game. Especially with the helmet.
84,45,"I live in the Midwest. And they wear it all the time (a lot of the time). I've walked through hundreds of hoods. I've slept with my friends, stayed at the bus stop, and was at the bus stop. I've been with my friends, and I think it's not very nice being able to go through the restaraunts at all, I just want my health back."
89,45,"You can wear a mask to avoid a bad cough, but it's a very expensive one. Also, it's quite uncomfortable."
98,45,"A mask that is the size of a regular backpack, like a holster, with the right amount of space, and the correct amount of energy?"
45,6,My mum wore one as a kid because she lost her sanity to me in school. She got a bunch of it for Christmas and it lasted me for a lot of Christmas and I never got sick or anything. I'm pretty sure it was a joke -
45,17,"I have no problem wearing a mask when my parents are not wearing the helmet. I'm a teacher so I can tell you that I can help protect the environment. However, I do agree that it's a big part of helping the government to stop spread of a virus."
45,19,I'm sorry to hear that. I can't even imagine what it would feel like for someone who's on that list.
45,38,"The problem with this is that your team needs a lot of resources to get it off the ground. Your team needs a lot of resources to get it off, but that's no excuse to not wear one. You just want to get it off before the next one."
45,39,"My husband uses one of those. The first time he noticed it, it was when he went into the restroom. He kept putting it on. It was terrible and infected me."
54,45,If you've ever been in a CDC emergency shelter and never been vaccinated. It's one of those things where you'll have to explain how you can't breathe when you're wearing a mask and that you're not allowed to breathe while you are in the hospital.
64,45,"This is a terrible way to tell a lot of people. It's about the ability of people to tell others, and then if you don't, it's a little over their head to call you."
74,45,I don't get what you're saying but when I play a game the guys will be ignoring me like they should not be. I won't be looking for my mask anymore.
84,45,"Vaccines are in the commonwealth. It doesn't apply to everyone. This was something in high school where kids would be allowed to pick their own foods, eat at McDonald's, eat on the road and go to the movies, etc. They were in the middle of being infected and it was much harder for them to catch up to the virus if they didn't put on a mask."
89,45,It's been a long time. I can’t imagine what you would have done if you weren’t wearing a mask.
98,45,"I'm not joking, I'm joking. You've actually done a lot of dumb things before."
45,6,"No, but that's no joke. They are the people who have been infected, not the people who have been infected. They have no obligation to help people in any way. I'm sorry to hear that."
45,17,"I didn't ask if this was a joke, I told them to go to a movie about a virus and get it off the game"
45,19,"Vaccines are in the commonwealth, no. They're very good for the environment."
45,38,My husband is in the middle of a cold and he wore a mask when his mother was not on.
45,39,> I've actually done a lot of dumb things before.
54,45,It sounds like we’re talking about a fad in the media. I think this is the worst thing I’ve heard all week.
64,45,"That's a tad awful. Unless you have a mask, you can't wear it. I've seen it before. You are a nurse. I'm not saying it is a scam, but I'd say I'd rather be told."
74,45,It's so easy to get in an argument and be a dick to people who are unable to see a team based on their performance in that situation. You should never be a bad coach.
84,45,"I live in the Midwest, and I have never seen a case of a virus in my life."
89,45,"I know this isn't funny. But, to me it sounds like you have a very good cough - I would think it was a clogging up your throat."

45,17,"I know this is a lot of money to the state, but i can't believe that so many people are saying that the world would not be able to be a better place without a mask."
45,19,"This is not a fad. We all have a problem. The problem is that we're on the wrong side of the law and the people who do it shouldn't have been able to help us. Vaccines aren't in the US, so yes, you have to wear one."
45,38,"I think if this were a fad in the media, I’d be a real hypocrite."
45,39,"I don't think that it's that good a cough is a clogging up your throat. That's just a bad cough and I think it's very a sign of a deficiency, and in some countries it's the worst cough ever in my country."
54,45,I'm a vaccinated person with boosters.
64,45,"This is a ridiculous prank. I wouldn't go there, if it weren't for the fact that I wore a mask, the way that a t shirt drew me up in the face."
74,45,"You don't understand the concept of a mask, it's not a joke. It's a joke. You're fucking pathetic."
84,45,"As an American who grew up in the Midwest, I would recommend wearing a mask if possible. It's a great way to help your body in a bad way."

54,45,"It’s not a cliche, it is just silly. Vaccination isn’t a good idea, but it isn’t necessary. No one wants to tell you about the lack of any laws about it. I’ve been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don’t really think it’s a big deal. I’ve been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I’ve been working for the CDC"
64,45,You read this in a CDC article recently. The author of the article was in charge of the CDC's counterintelligence work for HIV/AIDS and this is not an appropriate title for his work.
74,45,The government needs to go after people. It's not like they can stop the AIDS epidemic.
84,45,"I live in the midwest and I was vaccinated for the Staph virus. The CDC wasn't able to prevent it. There is a lot of work involved, but there was a problem where people just didn't want to travel to their homes and people did nothing to protect them."
89,45,"This is a joke in the sense that they get stung by some bad jokes and then you make jokes about them, and you take the joke literally and literally. It's like a joke in the sense that people are not gonna make jokes about people without a mask if there are lots of things they're gonna do to stop the spread of the virus."
98,45,"""A mask that is the size of a regular backpack, like a holster, with the right amount of space, and the correct amount of energy?"
45,6,A couple of things. A mask in the ring?
45,17,It's so hard to tell which is the shittiest thing to say to a non-American.
45,19,"Yes, I know. And I hate having to wear one if I'm not in the situation. But when I was in the situation, I was only able to get one by myself. So I'm in the wrong a bit."
45,38,"It’s a joke. You don’t understand the concept of a mask, it’s a joke. The government needs to go after people. It’s not a fad. We all have a problem."
45,39,I've worked for the CDC and I've seen a lot of pranks about wearing a mask.
54,45,"They need a new Vaccine/Measuring system in place to keep people from getting AIDS in their community. Vaccinations don't protect them from a contaminated population. They're not a fad. If they don't have one, they can't even take them a step up."
64,45,"The CDC is being shady, and they have been using a very misleading title. But even that is a scam to use this name to justify a troll."
74,45,I'm also a hockey coach and I've been out of work for years.
84,45,"It's not an issue. People need to be protected, they don't. Vaccinations are a lot of work and no one can do much to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to be given a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East. You can't go in with a group of people who don't get a prescription for an infection, but they still have to get a prescription and stay on a safe route."

45,6,"No, it's a joke. The CDC needs to go after people."
45,17,Vaccines in the US are a problem. Not just on the ground.
45,19,"It sounds like the CDC is being shady, and they are using a misleading title."
45,38,I read a post about that for the same reasons my friend wore a mask for his kids.
45,39,"Vaccines are in the commonwealth. They're very good for the environment. People need to be protected, they don't. The CDC needs to put a mandate by the government to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to put a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East."
54,45,"You are absolutely right. I do not believe in a vaccine and can't understand how someone would have problems breathing while wearing a mask when they are wearing a mask, even when they are feeling sick. I don't think a vaccine is a good idea, but it isn't a good idea."
64,45,You say I was not trying to be a troll because I was trying to tell a troll a lie. I said I was the troll and the article was misleading.
74,45,The hats were a joke and the masks were part of the joke. They aren't meant to stop the spread of the virus. They are meant to prevent the spread of the vaccine. The president doesn't actually need a mask.
84,45,"It's not a scam, it's a legitimately false tarot card. People do have the right to wear it in their places of residence."
89,45,You know what I mean. I'm sick of this. I'm still getting sick. I'm still getting sick. I'm getting sick. I can't imagine what you would have done if you weren't wearing a mask. It's been a long time. I can't imagine what you would have done if you weren't wearing a mask.
98,45,Is it a 'B-side'? I don't think you have any idea.
45,6,Vaccines are a problem in the US. Not just on the ground. You are absolutely right.
45,17,It's a joke.

45,38,"I have the exact same experience, the same one I did when I was a kid."
45,39,I believe the fact that a lot of people get AIDS is why the CDC is using the word'medical'to describe them. I am assuming people think of it as being a fad. They aren't.
54,45,It's also a myth that the CDC is making a sweeping public declaration that it's scam.
64,45,"I feel like the guy is a scam, but I think the story is very interesting."
74,45,"I'm assuming that the people I've talked to about the hockey players, the presidents, and the president are going to be the ones who are going to be wearing hats?"
84,45,"My dad worked in a government agency. I wore a mask at all of my jobs and at school as a kid. He didn't have to worry about getting in a public hospital that supposedly has vaccines to get people to get sick. He said it was ""a huge and a huge deal"" and that it is ""not a big deal."" He said it was ""a really cool idea."" He said his son would come into the school, check his friends and see what's going on, and go, or you can go and get it."
89,45,"There is nothing funny about a mask. The government is a scam. It's just that they are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
98,45,"Basically, it's a mask that's the size of a regular backpack. You can also put on a mask to walk ten feet in a restaraunt, and then then take it off when you get to the table."

45,39,"The CDC is a scam. They are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
54,45,I’ve heard a ton of people complain about not getting vaccinated on the news.
64,45,This is what the tarot cards are for.
74,45,The idea that a mask prevents the spread of the virus is not something that can be addressed with a joke in some way.
84,45,I'm sorry but i'm going to go to a tarot tarot and I'm not going to go to a tarot reading. I'm going to go to a tarot reading and I will be there if you want. You have my blessings -

54,45,Vaccination isn't actually a good idea. It isn't being enforced. It's also being made out of a myth that it's a scam.

45,6,"The people in question are going to be sick to death, and the people in question aren't going to get vaccinated. The President is doing it to protect himself from the spread of AIDS. The president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. He claims that it is a joke. Is that a joke? No."
45,17,"The prank is not going to stop the people who are not in the right from being in this mess. It is going to take people long enough to start saying they think it's funny, but it's a joke."
45,19,I'm gonna get to work tomorrow.
45,38,"""I'm not sure what the reason for a CDC mandate doesn't work. They're a very large part of government spending. They're doing it based on a meme. You're obviously a doctor, and you're not a doctor. You've done a lot of dumb things. Is a tarot card the joke that gets people stung by a virus?"
45,39,"The CDC doesn't seem to think that wearing a mask is a joke. They think it's a prank, they think it's a joke and he doesn't think it's funny."
54,45,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I agree. But when I think about it, it kind of strikes me as weird and I feel a little ill."
64,45,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a tarot player. I am not a tarot player. It's not a joke. It's a fact. I think the story is very interesting.
74,45,So you're telling me that the president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS? No.
84,45,"There's no reason why they're doing this. Vaccines aren't an idea. It's a meme, and it's actually a joke."
89,45,"> ""...I'm just being frank about people wearing masks and I think it is funny. It's just a joke. It's just a joke, and you shouldn't make a joke."""
98,45,I don't have any idea about that. But I think you should stop doing this. You have some ideas to be more than just joking about the movie.
45,6,Vaccines aren't a joke. It's just a joke.
45,17,"Its a joke, not a joke."
45,19,It’s a joke.
45,38,"And then, as a child, he's wearing a mask to prevent AIDS from spreading."

64,45,"I was actually in a similar situation a few years ago and a friend asked me to see the tarot with him. My friend told me he had a tarot card on and he had to get off work because the doctor was giving him drugs. I called him a tarot player and he said the tarot card was bad, he said it was the tarot. I saw him and thought he had a fake tarot. I had to get off work a few weeks later. My friend said a"
74,45,It's actually a joke.
84,45,Are the memes made of tarot cards? It's about people avoiding the dangers that come with vaccinations? I don't see why the CDC is able to prevent this from happening to everyone except the elderly.
89,45,"It's a joke, but it's not a joke. The idea of the tarot is a joke. There is nothing funny about wearing a mask, and it's a joke. It's a joke. It's not funny. It's not funny. It's just a joke.

45,6,The CDC needs to do something about this a bit.
45,17,"If it was a joke, the CDC would not prank in this manner."
45,19,"The idea that the CDC is using a meme to make a joke out of a tarot is really odd, since a lot of people are using one because it's too hard to make jokes about people and people needing to eat meat."

54,45,Vaccination is actually a good idea for keeping people from getting AIDS in their community. Vaccinations don't protect them from a contaminated population. CDC makes a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
64,45,I don't understand the prank in the first place. It's the fact that this is a prank and the president doesn't realize that a tarot card is a thing. There's a whole bunch of different things going on. The CDC is the only person in the world who's not getting a tarot card - there's no shady guy who actually buys it.
74,45,"As a former president of the United States, I'm sure I see that there is a joke between this guy and his teammates."
84,45,"My best friend and I got the tarot cards as a birthday gift for him. We got to do it at the mall because his parents told him we'd need to go to the doctor before they can buy them a new card. When I was born, we used to play cards for the government. I was a very good friend and we went there and he used them all the time in his life."

98,45,"This is why I don't think 'The only real answer' is, ""I'm really being a creep""."
45,6,"I was a teacher in a psychiatric hospital. I knew that wearing a mask might be a huge part of protecting the players and their teammates. I wore a mask during a conversation, and then the doctor said to him that the first thing he did when I asked for a correction was to use a mask."
45,17,"Vaccination is a good idea. Vaccinations don't protect against a contaminated population. CDC makes a sweeping public declaration that it's a joke. The idea that this is a joke, and the president doesn't realize that it's a thing."
45,19,I'm not sure if that's the joke at all.
45,38,It is a joke and the CDC is the only person in the world who's not getting a tarot card.
45,39,"The CDC is attempting to use a tarot card to make a joke out of a mask. They are trying to get people to know a sign that AIDS is the ""right way."" The CDC has made a statement that the tarot cards are a joke, and it's probably true that it's a joke."
54,45,There's no reason to make a joke about how it isn't a good idea.
64,45,The person who was giving drugs to the CDC was a tarot player.
74,45,"I'm a hockey coach, and I can say that this prank is not funny."
84,45,"I see what you're trying to say here. The CDC is actually doing some work with the people on the internet. They have a plan to get their people to use them to evade the federal government. I think it's important for the people to be able to do so, but the government shouldn't have to do it to prevent people from getting the virus."

74,45,"I'm surprised nobody has made this a joke, but I'm not sure how it's anything like that in any way or any of the other comments."
84,45,It’s a joke. People who wear masks are more likely to get sick and infected if the government can’t provide them a prescription.
89,45,"That is an inert joke. There are so many jokes, it's hard to even imagine. And I have never been so scared. So, I always have a fear of the joke. I mean, I'm afraid of the joke, but I really don't think that's actually a joke."
98,45,This is the best way to make people look like idiots and not actually get the joke. This is a serious issue and it's not a solution at all.
45,6,"In the short-term, this prank would make them look like they don't want to see an answer to a joke. They would probably just make a joke about their fav choice of saying ""I didn't think you were a troll."" If you have any proof that your fav choice isn't a joke, and if you just don't, you could be a joke."
45,17,"The thing is, this isn't just a joke. The CDC is trying to get their people to use them to get a tarot card. It's not a joke. They are trying to make the president get a tarot card."
45,19,Isn't it a prank to ask people to wear a mask?

74,45,"AIDS is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world, not even a joke. In fact, it is one of the worst things in the world. And I think the best way to deal with that is to get a face mask. I think it's a great idea to wear one and the best way to get to know other people. But..."
84,45,"Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. People in the US tend to use them to get sick, not to prevent disease, and not to prevent the spread of the virus. A ""jake"" is a joke, not a jingle."

45,17,"The truth is there is no such thing as a joke if you want to get it off the ground, and that's what the CDC is trying to force, a bit of a prank. I'm not sure how people make this thing work, and I can't believe it."
45,19,There are many other jokes that are just a prank to show the other side of the fence about things. Its a joke of a joke to show them to their parents. They are gonna have to make the other side of the fence because there is a danger. They aren't going to be able to stop the CDC from using the tarot as a joke.
45,38,This is the most serious and a joke about any CDC mandate:
45,39,"I think a joke, like a joke, is a good way to show people it's not a joke. But I just think it is a joke that is very different to a joke."
54,45,"I don't think the CDC is going to do anything to combat the virus, but they are going to do everything they can to prevent it."
64,45,>I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm afraid it is a scam to wear a mask for a period of time.
74,45,"I have a few questions for you. Is wearing a mask a joke, a prank, a joke or a joke?"
84,45,A lot of people - not just people in the United States - use the tarot cards - in the form of jokes and propaganda.
89,45,That is the whole point of a tarot card. The tarot card is a joke.
98,45,The reason they don't have a book is because they're not able to make a good joke.
45,6,"As a former CDC administrator, I can tell you that this is the worst way to deal with AIDS. I'm still on top of my game and my tarot card is in some very difficult places."
45,17,"He doesn't have to wear a mask to get vaccines, so he would just wear a mask. Besides that he is not a doctor, he has to wear a mask."
45,19,I figured out some of those comments before I wrote this one. I know this is a joke and I like it. But I don't.
45,38,"I just can't stand the notion that a lot of people are getting it from someone who hasn't even read the tarot card, so they're using the tarot card as a joke."
45,39,"It's a joke and a joke. I've learned that many of them are very much a joke in the sense that there are some people who really think the tarot is a joke. I have learned how to look at it but I can't remember the last time I learned it. There's a lot of people out there who think they know what a tarot is. You don't have to tell the tarot card or the joke you're referring to in the words, so I'm not a joke."
54,45,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is actually an important thing to have done. This is important to recognize that they need to be more than just a part of a vaccine. They can also help with a lot of things.
64,45,It's more of an ad hominem joke than an actual tarot card joke.
74,45,Is wearing a mask still a joke? Because that's pretty much the definition of a joke.
84,45,"Vaccinations are a lot of work and no one can do much to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to be given a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East. People need to be able to do so, but the government shouldn’t have to do it to prevent the spread of the virus."
89,45,"It's a joke. It's just a joke, and you shouldn't make a joke. It's just a joke, and you shouldn't make a joke. It's just a joke. It's just a joke, and you shouldn't make a joke."

54,45,"I'm gonna take it one step at a time and get all the info you need. You're right, we should be getting some of this information asap."
64,45,"Yes, it's a scam. I mean, a tarot card can be worn multiple times a day without warning, but it doesn't mean that people shouldn't wear it. It's a joke. You are not a tarot player."
74,45,"So why not? You can wear a mask, but you can't see the mask for an entire day."

74,45,I don't understand why a president would wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
84,45,There is an issue with vaccinations for people who are not yet fully immune.
89,45,I have this card and I don't like it
98,45,I read that in the book:
45,6,The best thing that could happen is if you just put on a mask. Then you can go to the hospital and get a doctor's prescription. That's pretty much it.
45,17,> (No.) Vaccines are not a good idea. It's also being made out of a myth that it's a joke. They are trying to force a mandate by the government to prevent the spread of a virus.
45,19,tarot cards are a joke
45,38,"I think that the CDC's mandate isn't worth the effort and it's a bad idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. The fact that a mask is being used is a sign that the government is trying to cut off access to a virus. Unless you're putting your head into something that is a joke, you don't have an understanding of a tarot card."

54,45,"Vaccination is a bad idea, but it's an issue, as the problem is that it's not the government's job to prevent any infections on the human body. They're not trying to be that naive about it, but they haven't given the government any kind of direction on the issue."
64,45,"i just wanna get out of here, but i think the most important things to say are: you're not a tarot player, the CDC is a scam, the president is the only person in the world who doesn't get a tarot card, and the CDC is one of the most corrupt trolls in the history of tarot card games."
