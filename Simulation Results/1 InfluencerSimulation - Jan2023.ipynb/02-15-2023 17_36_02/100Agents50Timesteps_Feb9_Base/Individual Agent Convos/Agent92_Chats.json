    "So a friend of mine who had a cold went to the CDC and they used a mask that it was just too big to put on and she was able to get out of bed with the help of the mask. She also said she used the mask to put on her hands when she lost her dick.",
    "If it were a scam, I think this would be a great place to put it, as the CDC and the other health systems don't believe it's a scam.",
    "My husband is an AIDS patient, and I've been in a similar situation. He had the dick and was able to get it out of bed with the help of the mask. I ah-ha-ha. We had some dick and I could get it back, and it didn't take too long for the CDC to tell the doctor I was a scammer. So that might have been a scam, but the fact that it's a scam is just too much of a scam.",
    "A rapist screams a lot of this crap out at him.",
    "I'm very confused, but I really need to see what the CDC's message is.",
    "I think it's a scam because you are not aware of how serious the virus is. That's why I'm in the right here.",
    "What he said was literally a lot like saying you\u2019re going to get shit out of it?",
    "I'd recommend doing some research. It's the CDC's approach to putting people in danger. It's really complicated.",
    "The most important thing for you to know is that if you're going to lie about it, you should actually be talking about it.",
    "You are the CDC. No one ever calls you a scammers and no one makes you believe it is a scam.",
    "I don't think you need to be so crazy to think that a guy who is in fact a doctor that was only told one time that he was a scammer or is one of the ones that is a scammer.",
    "I'm not sure what you're talking about. The actual part of the story that makes the most sense is that people are able to prevent a'scam' from going around wearing the masks because of a virus, and when they get sick enough to see an'scam', they get the information and not just be concerned about it.",
    "I don't have a good way to tell the story of how I lost my mask.",
    "You're being a shill.",
    "AIDS is not a virus. It's not a virus. The CDC is scamming people into doing their job. Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you're not going to get a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. The fact that people scream out \"I'm not sure what I'm talking about. The fact that people scream out \"I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.",
    "Vaccines are not \"scams\". They are a scam. The only way to stop it from spread is to get people vaccinated. The only way to stop it from spreading is to find the best med possible, and find the best way. The only way to get people to vaccinate is to get them vaccinated and get a vaccine. But if you get sick, then get vaccinated, then you're not a sick person, so you have to get a lot of meds available. You're just a scam",
    "The CDC says that it will help prevent the spread of AIDS, but AIDS has been causing serious harm for 15 years, so we're talking about about this, and I'll probably have to call someone out on it.",
    "So when people make that assumption about the CDC, they are claiming that the CDC can't test AIDS or that there is some real evidence that it is a scam?",
    "If they vaccinate people who don't know what they are getting, they can get some of that money back. That's a legitimate shady plan of action, the CDC wants to do it, but it's not working.",
    "I was born with a virus, and have lost many health care choices. It has been in my family for 20 years, and I was constantly asked for help. There is a lot more to this than just being sick, so the doctor should help me figure out the answer.",
    "You're not a scammer. You're a scammer. It's all a scam.",
    "Is the CDC a scam? Because that's how they have to respond to you.",
    "I don't have the answer.",
    "\"A good joke is not always a joke, and it can be useful when describing someone who loses their mask and finds out that they actually had a virus.\", \"I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re not a scammer. I\u2019m probably a scammer. I\u2019m probably a scammer.\", \"I know a lot of people who are getting vaccinated because if you get sick, then get vaccinated, then get vaccinated, then get vaccinated, and you\u2019re not ",
    "The CDC is not a scam. It\u2019s not a scam, it\u2019s not a scam. They don\u2019t test things, they don\u2019t do them. If people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting, they\u2019re not a scammer.",
