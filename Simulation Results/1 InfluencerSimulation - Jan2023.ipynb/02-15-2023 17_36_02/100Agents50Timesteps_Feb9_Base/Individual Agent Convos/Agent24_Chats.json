    "i think you are being facetious.",
    "I really like the idea that people could say \"Hey, the government is using a mask to combat AIDS\". I hate the word AIDS.",
    "So, you're the first of a million people to use this euphemism because you think it's ridiculous. It's a bit harsh for someone to not realize that even if it's a funny one, it's really a valid one and it's probably not really a good idea to wear one.",
    "You don't know what the answer to this is.",
    "As a medical student I used to wear masks for a long time. I've never heard anyone say a different euphemism and I'm just never taught the joke, either. I was the same way and I just always tried not to tell people.",
    "The government isn't really a bad idea. It just helps in spreading a virus. The government does.",
    "You've got an idea, and you have it right. I mean, we all know that you're a doctor, and that the government can't just let you live your life as an abolitionist, and that you're a politician.",
    "And you get the joke. I don't really care what a doctor says, or what a politician says. But this isn't exactly \"Affection of the fuck, you aren't going to stop the virus.\" Or \"I don't think you are being facetious.\"",
    "The idea of masks helps keep people from being sick. It's the same idea that made people sick when their doctors died. They are only one in a million people and the government has a right to keep you in quarantine.",
    "A GP can use a mask to combat AIDS, the Government is helping people get away with it. Those are the ones that need help. It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's just a joke.",
    "It sounds like they are bringing up a huge problem with masks that are not supposed to be treated with respect or care. It's a good idea to just don't say it, because the joke doesn't mean that you aren't a doctor and have to use a mask.",
    "The joke is the truth. The government isn't using it to stop AIDS or stop it. The joke just works. You don't know what the answer is?",
    "\"I want you to come off as a joke. What's the problem with a mask? The government is bringing up AIDS to fight it.\"",
    "I would never have said that.. I would say \"You're a pretty good guy who is a doctor and a bit more interested in health than people that aren't doctors.\".",
    "Affirmative action is part of the way the government is using a mask. AIDS is a disease that's more of a mental illness. There is a song about it called Face the AIDS which has a slur.",
    "I think the people who are trying to laugh about this aren't the people who are complaining.",
    "\"Somebody else is bringing it up. That's the joke that makes me feel guilty. But I do think it's funny to think that someone who is trying to make a point isn't going to be able to really understand the concept of the word \"jam\".",
    "\"What do you think the answer is?\"",
    "What are the lyrics of this song?",
    "The song is titled 'The AIDS Is Coming'. It's titled 'The AIDS Is Coming.'",
    "I'd put out a statement like this, like \"I don't know why they're trying to make a joke\". I can honestly say that this is pretty funny.",
    "So how would the people who don't like it say \"I'm not a doctor and I would never have said that.\"?",
    "I believe it comes from the song \"I love it. I love it. But I don't like it. I have this whole AIDS joke thing going on and I can't believe how bad it is for the whole people who are in hospital with HIV.",
    "The one of the many good things about the song is that it is a good one that's good because it's a slang phrase that people don't like.",
    "I don't think he has any respect for any of the people who have the virus.",
    "I think the problem here is that the government can use a mask to help combat AIDS. The problem is not that the government is helping the spread of the virus.",
    "What the government is trying to do is try to make the government feel better, if it were a virus.",
    "...I'm going to go...",
    "AIDS is actually a disease, it's not a virus.",
    "I read the headline. It's funny. It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. And it's not a joke.",
    "I think it's a tad misinformed - people are gonna do whatever they want and that's what happens when they don't understand this. This is a joke about the government causing problems to millions of people.",
    "IANAL, but I would like to point out that I don't have the ability to get into the right mindset to be a doctor as my gp, and that being a doctor is really the best option for me to be a doctor. I can't imagine a lot of people who would never be able to be able to take that type of attitude.",
    "I feel like the whole point of a mask is that there's an infection, but a mask prevents that. And that's just it. It's not a joke.",
    "I think this is pretty funny.",
    "If you say it's a joke, it makes no sense unless you say the term in English.",
    "\"I don't like a mask.\"",
    "I like this song and the song \"Assholes's joke\"",
    "It sounds like they're trying to bring up the problem of AIDS, which means that they're trying to treat the problem of AIDS. The slur is an obvious joke.",
    "I think it's a good idea to make a joke about the idea of having a mask on. You gotta think about that.",
    "\"So, you're the first of a million people to use this euphemism because you think it's ridiculous. It's a joke that they're trying to make a joke about the government causing problems to millions of people.\", \"As a medical student I used to wear masks, but a lot of the time a mask helps combat a virus.\", \"I do wear masks, but a lot of the time a mask helps combat a virus.\", \"Assholes\"",
    "I don't know a doctor but I do wear a mask so I'm afraid I've probably said that the joke is not that funny.",
    "It's probably also a joke because AIDS is a real virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's real.",
    "I'm not a doctor, but I do know a lot of people who are sick of being in the government in the same way. I've never heard someone say '... I do wear masks, but a lot of the time a mask helps combat a virus.",
    "I've been in the government for a long time and I can tell you it's not a joke, but a joke."
