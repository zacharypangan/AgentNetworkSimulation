    "The movie \"Blackout\" had a lot of similar songs that weren't particularly good.",
    "This is a good point, the lyrics are fucking horrible, the lyrics don't even go to slack.",
    "This post has become the euphemism for why we call this \"fake AIDS\" and \"fake AIDS.\"",
    "I'm not sure where they think this will go with this - the most euphemism of the entire thread is people making fun of the government, the one and only and other other people who don't have a problem with it.",
    "There is a new wiki article about it that is about the euphemism for the government, and how to prevent a viral illness. That article says you need to use your mask to fight AIDS.",
    "There's a song called \"The One and Only\". It's about how the government helps with spreading a virus.",

    "\"We are using the mask to combat the spread of the disease.",
    "It sounds like the guy in question is making fun of the government, but the song is not. You may be in a better position to say the same thing but don't want to make fun of the government, and that's a very small part of what makes this song so bad.",
    "...[T]he government is bringing up the problem.",
    "\"Wow. This is the biggest issue I've had with the government.",
    "The one and only has more information than \"the one and only\". I think it is good if people actually are using the song as a joke, not just to promote it.",
    "I don't know what to think about the song, but if you want to know something like that, you have to start out with a song called \"The one and only\" by Bob Dylan.",

    ">I'm sorry that we can't stop... That's an incompetent way of saying it.",
    "I've got a question: who are the people that are using the song?",
    "So, the guy who said it, and the other guy who says it, in his last words and phrases, makes a good point?",
    "There is a song called \"The One and Only\" that is about how the government helps with spreading a virus.",
    "\"T]he government is bringing up the problem.",
    "And the song is called \"Task The Doctor.''",
    "\"I'm sorry that we can't stop... That's an incompetent way of saying it.\"",
    "I think you guys are being a little too naive here.",
    "sarcasm here is a bad word.",
    "I've got a little sarcasm in my ear right now, but I've seen it. The one and only jokes if people are using the song as a joke.",
    "So you're saying that people can't help spread the AIDS virus because they have HIV. So, instead, people are trying to stop them by using the AIDS AIDS virus.",
    "\"This post has become the euphemism for why we call this \"fake AIDS\" and \"fake AIDS.\"",
    "This isn't the first time a song that makes fun of someone is being used like that, but a new one is being used to promote a disease.",
    "The song is about the government helping spread a virus.",
    "So it is actually good advice if people actually are using the song as a joke, not just to promote it.",
    "Then there is r/aspn, where you'll find people who can't stop it. They don't know if this is true, but if they don't know it isn't true.",
    "I'm not a doctor.",
    "It's a good point. But I'm just not sure that's it. And I don't understand why people think this is a joke.",
    "I read a good section in an article about the r/aspn community, and it's very very interesting.",
    "I think you should read the title, if you're using the word joke, as an excuse to keep doing it, so that no one gets naive and it doesn't appear the whole thing is a joke, and a comedy.",
    "It's not a joke. It's a joke.",
    "It's a joke. I'm a therapist and I'm a doctor. It's a joke. But it's a joke.",

    "AIDS is not a joke. It's a problem. AIDS is a problem.",
    "I'm a doctor and I've always liked this song (I have it and it was an excellent joke) and I can't stand this one. I don't see it as a joke or anything like that. I think the lyrics to it are really sad and it's a little off-putting, but it's just really not a good joke. AIDS is not a joke. It's a joke and it isn't funny, and it doesn't work. But I don't know what to think of the song.",
    "It's really weird that I haven't seen any of the lyrics, but there's actually some interesting facts.",
    "if you're getting sick and you're wearing a mask it's a joke. It's a joke.",
