This is what a lot of people forget about putting on a mask in public - the fact that it's the only way to stay safe and a clingy mask is enough to keep people from talking to each other.
83,59,I've been to a couple of events and my friend didn't know I was there. I was told I was in the wrong and I never did. I went to the first TWC in a few years and he said he didn't know until I was able to do that and he told me I needed to get the vaccinated.

59,37,It's been a long time since I've read /r/police/posts/police_reports/Persona-Cracked-Through-Attorney_Card/Tarot_Cracked_Through_Canadian/P This would inevitably be a scam.

70,59,So the President wears a mask to stop the spread of AIDS?
83,59,I think a lot of this has something to do with the idea of the government being a huge scumbag.

94,59,The President is promoting a virus that is very dangerous for people. It's not an elitist thing for government agencies to not make sure that people don't get sick. The government is promoting a virus that is very dangerous for people.

65,59,"As in all the things people get to do, or try to do and get on the CDC list, is not what I meant."

94,59,"I had to read this at the school to check it out. It's a bit hard to find a good story on how people in the US tarot cards are used in a variety of ways. One is that they're both tarot cards and the tarot card itself is a real thing, not a joke."
59,37,People want to be on the CDC's list. I'm a little sick of the snooping in the back.
65,59,"If you are still using the CDC's excuse as a joke, I'd rather they just use a more accurate answer. I do the same thing to get vaccinated. Getting out of a hood with the hood on, and getting on a mask is a huge problem for me, but a mask makes no difference in the long run. I don't get how this makes any sense. I think the answer is, but I can't remember how long I've been on a mask."

94,59,The President is promoting AIDS and he hasn't been a politician.
59,37,"I don't know what other word there is to make this a scam, but there's an arbitrary statement that the government is allowing people to wear a mask and can't control where they are. It's a good joke to use for all the wrong things and to do it for good."
65,59,I don't think anyone in the government would actually know that a person who is vaccinated will get an immunization. A friend of mine did this to her husband. He was using the joke as a cover-up. A man who was in school was getting an immunization. I would probably end up getting an immunization because of a hood.
70,59,He doesn't have to wear a mask in public if it's not required. But he does have a mask. That is a joke.
83,59,I think the reason he is calling out TWC is that he is against this.

83,59,I am a medic who has snooped on me. I did a lot of snooping.
93,59,"A tarot card isn't a scam. It's a tarot card that goes out and makes you feel better. It's not fake, and it's not scam-able, it is just too far-fetched to be true."
94,59,"What you're talking about is a prank, which you don't want to know. The joke itself is a prank, not a joke."
59,37,"People are going to snoop on the tarot card, a tarot card, and a mask to make money and keep them safe."
65,59,A lot of people have a bad habit of having an immunization because the government has already started to use them. A lot of people have gone in and do it and still don't feel they have a problem.
70,59,It's kind of obvious from all the comments. I'd probably go ahead and read /r/tarot if I saw your comment. You seem like you know more than the average person.
83,59,"The headline says ""[It's a joke] i like a nice nice mask. But I'd like to be in the midst of that shit. It's fun, but I don't want to get in a snooping twitch and the government is an exception to it."""

65,59,"People in the CDC need to be treated as if they weren't. I'm not going to talk about what it's a joke, but the government needs to be shown that there are a lot of dicks on the CDC's side. It's all about how they fuck people who aren't, and how they don't care what the CDC says. They've already been doing it for several decades but the number of people with a virus is way more and more people aren't aware that vaccines are not"
70,59,"The CDC is not involved in the prevention of AIDS, but is working on it. If it does not stop HIV, the CDC isn't doing anything about it. The CDC is not involved in prevention."

93,59,"""I feel like I had to wear it to a scary movie a few times. I'm sorry. But I didn't get sick from a mask. I'm afraid of the idea that you can not wear a mask."","
94,59,"That's a very stupid and misleading joke. The fact is, a good thing the president actually knows what's going on. And if there's anything left for us to know, there are dozens of other jokes about AIDS."
59,37,"The CDC and the CDC want to stop the spread of AIDS. It's also a good idea, but it's not necessary."
65,59,"This is why it’s called the ‘Fast and Furious’ section. Then the ‘Fast and Furious’ section of the wiki page. There is a sub to this page. There is a sub to this section for anyone interested in reading. The main one is the ""Fast and Furious” section, so it’s interesting."
70,59,This is a very relevant discussion.
83,59,"CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer and author of the book It's a joke, a joke, and it doesn't belong in this thread, it's a troll."
93,59,">A lot of this stuff is based on an old story, namely that people have an extremely bad rape history and have made a fool of themselves. That's a lot more important than the card."
94,59,What is the joke of a tarot card that made me laugh?
59,37,It seems the most important thing to talk about is the health of the country.
65,59,I think it's funny because it's part of the policies to stop the spread of the virus. It's funny because it's about the government having the right to make people feel bad about vaccines.
70,59,"It's a joke, a joke for an example."
83,59,"I have been talking to this guy in a lot of different ways about twitchcon, I'm in the process of learning about a sexism issue."
93,59,If I was a lawyer I would be a lawyer. Having a tarot deck and a tarot card on my hand.
94,59,- I'm not sure what your definition of 'prank' means.

65,59,The CDC is a very big piece of shit. The government is fucking with the public and is trying to make people feel bad about vaccines. But the CDC is really a bad place to be a slur and not really making anyone feel bad about it.
70,59,"I'm going to say that the CDC has a legitimate issue with it, and that the government has a legal right to do so."
83,59,>I'm not saying you don't understand this. ''The government is acting like a devil. The CDC is acting like a devil.''''''''''''''''.''''
93,59,You should probably buy a tarot card. It is worth more than one or two dollars.
94,59,"OP: ""You have the right to wear a mask, and they aren't allowed to have it, even if you are a government employee. The government is allowing you to wear a mask and not be permitted to leave."""

70,59,"I love the tarot cards, but don't really understand them"
83,59,It's not a joke. It's a joke because you've got to put on a mask and take off the mask when you get to the table.
93,59,"This shit is all too much. There's a lot of shit going on in this sub, but I believe it's a scam. Having a deck that says ""...I have a tarot card"" and a tarot card on my hand."
94,59,A lot of people think the president is a prick and they don't want to see his work.
59,37,"OP is being a liar, and you don't seem to have a real sense of humour. There are a couple of very different sides to this."
65,59,"Is it in your health that they have no incentive to have people vaccinated? Because they've been in a situation like this for decades. The CDC has had their problems, and so has a few people with a bad habit of doing it."
70,59,People are saying that putting on a mask makes me less comfortable when I work with people who do not want to be a doctor.
83,59,"[The article], the only way to get people to laugh."
93,59,"A tarot card isn't a scam. It's a deck that goes out and makes you feel better. It's not fake, and it's not scam-able. It's not scam-able. The government is a big part of it."
94,59,That shit is very misleading and makes me think that he's just trying to get people to get a tarot deck because it's the first thing that they are getting. s
59,37,He's just saying he wants the kids to get to be a doctor.

70,59,"The CDC and the White House have some very interesting stuff on the subject - there's a lot going on with them about a lot of these things and how much they should change and their actions. I find the story interesting, I think that the CDC has a legitimate issue with a mask, based on what I learned about it."
83,59,A doctor once told me there was a group that was talking about how she could get into public health without a mask.
93,59,I've read this post and I've read the whole thing and you've made me a bit upset and now I'm really sick of y'all
94,59,"This is the new title. There is a comment about how the CDC is putting on masks in the US to promote AIDS. This is one of the many things that a lot of people on here say is funny, but also a big deal."
59,37,Apparently the white house is using the mask to stop people from getting snooping and not even trying to explain it.
65,59,"I think this is an excellent idea, but there's not much else there."
70,59,The CDC should have a very simple plan for stopping the spread of HIV. It's the CDC's only objective and most effective method of stopping AIDS.
83,59,I have never seen a TWC and have heard of the fact that a hoodie will help people with snooping.
93,59,IANAL. I'm not even a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer.
94,59,This is the joke of the day:
59,37,">If a person was in the bathroom and someone tried to call him ""Pety"" and snooping while the guy was out of the bathroom.', 'I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
65,59,"""The CDC is using some form of sarcasm as a weapon in the public's eyes."""
70,59,"I like the quote that the CDC blew the tarot card. I love the tarot cards, but I don't really understand it."
83,59,"I have read it, but I have not heard of any of it. I have not heard the last snooping but I do not see anyone in the comments posting that it's a joke."
93,59,"The ''Want''' is a question that can be asked through multiple channels to help with this, in a situation like the one I'm on."
94,59,The president is promoting AIDS.
59,37,The CDC is not involved in preventing AIDS.
65,59,People need to know their vaccinations are not worth the risk of their own lives and don't rely on the government as an excuse to spread it in an effort to save them.
70,59,I don't think that there is any issue with the mask. It doesn't have to stop AIDS. The government has a legitimate issue.
83,59,I feel like 'The mask' is a joke. I don't feel that the CDC's mandate that makes a person vaccinated and not mandates a mask are both sexist.
93,59,"""I believe it is a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. They can't be made to be real, they're fake."
94,59,"""They are trying to promote a virus."""

65,59,A lot of people do not know how to use a hood.
70,59,"The CDC is trying to get CDC employees to stop using a mask to spread the virus. It's a joke. It makes the people in a room a little more comfortable, and they make a huge mess about it. There's no reason to put on a mask, it's a prank that doesn't help. There's no reason to have a clingy mask at all. It's just a prank, and there's no reason to use it in the workplace or that you have to be a person."
83,59,"The CDC is doing nothing wrong, they are simply not wanting to make it happen."
93,59,So do they have a card that is worth more than one or two dollars?
94,59,"""Is that what the people are complaining about?"", ""I think the whole thing is a scam. It's a scam, but the whole thing is a scam."""
59,37,Is there some way that you can go to a CDC office and get a piece of tarot card without having to go to a doctor?
65,59,"A man in my family got the flu and a man in my family got the flu. It was really bad, the flu had nipped all over us, and we got a bunch of the diseases from him. We went to hospital with that and the doctors said they could treat him better, but he was sick with it. My family was ill, and we got a blood test and a scan of his lung, the flu, and the flu, and it got worse. Then we got a blood test. I fucked up and had to be on the otx"
70,59,The CDC does not require any kind of security. You need a mask to get a better job. You need to have a mask that isn't in a public place and be safe and comfortable. You should wear a mask that is prone to catching and spreading AIDS.
83,59,"In fact, the article is saying that a mask is a joke. A friend did a snooping routine on him at the AIDS community's conference and said he didn't understand why he was going to have a blast."
93,59,The article states that this isn't a scam. It's a scam. They're scammers. They're scammers. The government is a big part of it.
94,59,"CANNOTANSWER: I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
59,37,I'm a lawyer. I know a lot of Canadians who are.
65,59,"So, in order to save people from a deadly disease, you have to be vaccinated? Yes, because it’s a serious disease, and it’s a serious health concern. But the CDC is going to make us really sick. They want us to live in the future."
70,59,"I'm a tarot player, and it was my pleasure to read the tarot card."
83,59,"So the idea of wearing a mask for snooping is a joke, and a doctor isn't a troll?"
93,59,IANAL. The tarot and the government are actually scammers. They're scammers. The government is a big part of it.
94,59,The problem is a prank. The prank is a joke.
59,37,>...I don’t know what other word there is to make this a scam. They are scammers. The government is a big part of it.
65,59,"The CDC isn't doing sarcasm. It's taking away the possibility that a joke is an effective way to stop the spread of disease. The only way they can get to that point is to use the name ""no"" because that's exactly what they're trying to get across in this video."
70,59,"You said "" I know the CDC has a legitimate issue with it, and that the government has a legitimate issue with it""?"
83,59,You might want to read the docs version of the article and re read it
93,59,">I feel like I had to wear it to a scary movie a few times. I'm sorry. But I didn't get sick from a mask. I'm afraid of the idea that you can not wear a mask. I think the best way to take it is to read the ""Wants"" in a tarot deck.',"
94,59,"It's a joke, but not a prank. The whole thing is a scam."
59,37,"The CDC has a monopoly on the use of public health. We are allowed to snoop on all public health records, and we have the ability to work outside of those records."
65,59,What is the purpose of this sentence?
70,59,"Vaccination is not required, but the CDC is putting together a program to prevent the spread of HIV. It’s not a joke. It’s just a prank, and it’s not necessary. Vaccination is a legitimate issue, but it’s not necessary."
83,59,"Yes, I get the satire, but as a non-no-no-no-no-no, the whole thing sounds ridiculous, sexist, and naive."
93,59,"You can do it, if you want. You can do it anywhere. I know it sounds strange but I'm so used to it."
94,59,i think it's hilarious how you seem to assume it's a joke to play tarot cards on the tv
59,37,"""I think the joke is a prank. The government is a big part of it. The government is a big part of it."
65,59,"The CDC, citing this article as part of the ACA mandate that vaccinators are kept in the clear and only available for use during periods of unvaccinated periods."
70,59,"I think the tarot is a really good card, just because it's a prank, but doesn't mean it's the most important thing you could read in a day. The idea of a card is an odd one."
83,59,It is actually the reason that CDC and their programs are not working with the CDC.
93,59,... and there's only a tarot card in the wiki.
94,59,"So the CDC is actually promoting AIDS, but not promoting it, and that means they are trying to sell tarot cards to scumbags in the United States. They're trying to promote a virus that is very dangerous for people and that's a scam."
59,37,I don't know if the president is a scumbag but I think it is a scam.
65,59,“There’s a lot of people who don’t understand the difference between “I’m a prick and a dick” and “I’m doing the wrong thing”
70,59,Using the tarot card as an example of the sort of thing is a bit strange in the sense that it has a jokey meaning. It could be a prank. It would be a prank to use a prank card to stop a virus.
83,59,CANNOTANSWER (and his family) is a lawyer whose role is to bring awareness to a group of people who've been in the news and the CDC in their field and have snooped on them. He's been in an interview with a news agency and has given no indication of a work history.
93,59,"I think the best way to take it is to read the ""Wants"" in a tarot deck. It's the ""Want"" is the best way to go."
94,59,It's a prank. It's a joke.
59,37,CANNOTANSWER:
65,59,CDC is not a joke.
70,59,I think putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,59,I don't think anyone has an explanation. The article is about the CDC as an emergency medical device and people would want a mask.
93,59,"""I have a tarot card and a card on my hand."
94,59,"No, I think it's a joke."
59,37,It's been a while since I've read anything about a tarot card.
65,59,This is a very serious health problem that the government can't be trusted to answer. There are too many people to be trusted.
70,59,A tarot card is a good thing to ask yourself.
83,59,"There's an AMA here about a doctor. He says he is trying to get his wife to stop snooping on him, not to stop him from having sex with people at TWC. It is a joke."
93,59,It is a scam because it is the wrong word.
94,59,"No, the'scam' is a joke."
59,37,"...I really have to go."""
65,59,">""I've never seen a hood around the neck with the hood on, and getting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things."", ""I love tarot cards. I have had my hands on so much of them I've only ever known one person to do it."", ""I love tarot cards. I have had my hands on so much of them I've seen the hood around the neck"
70,59,"I'm going to say that it's a prank. It's a joke because it's a fact. It’s a joke because it’s a fact. It’s a prank because it’s a joke. It’s a prank because it’s a prank, but it’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a prank, and it’s a joke."
83,59,I think the point of a mask is a joke. Is a mask not a joke.
93,59,"I think the best way to take it is to read the ""Wants"" in a tarot deck. I'm not sure why you guys are coming here but it's good to see."
94,59,There are more jokes on tarot cards than the president. Ingraham just made a joke about wearing a mask to spread the virus.
59,37,I think the only time I know about a tarot card is after I read a tarot deck / tarot deck.
65,59,"“People on the CDC's side are doing the same thing as other members of Congress. People who don't understand how to use a mask are using the government's insensitive jokes. It seems like they're trying to make it seem like they're trying to clog the ACA, but they are trying to make it seem like they're trying to make it seem like they're trying to sabotage the health system."
70,59,A lot of people are calling it a prank because they know it's a joke.
83,59,And they don't have mandates. Why do you think it is a joke?
93,59,I am not a lawyer. I am a lawyer.
94,59,"A number of people said 'The joke is a joke, but the whole thing is a joke. The whole thing is a joke."
59,37,"""I think the joke is a prank, but the whole thing is a joke."
65,59,I don't think this article is worth reading.
70,59,"In my experience, a tarot card is a joke if it is used in a way to scare people into thinking it is a joke, but the actual purpose is a prank."
83,59,Vaccination is a major issue in our society. The government has mandated that vaccines be applied to children and families in the USA. That doesn't make it a joke.
93,59,"I want to say, I feel a little 'a little bit'' of the first few lines of your comment about the other side of the sentence."
94,59,"So, [Says that the CDC is promoting AIDS.](https://www.concurricula.gov/)"
