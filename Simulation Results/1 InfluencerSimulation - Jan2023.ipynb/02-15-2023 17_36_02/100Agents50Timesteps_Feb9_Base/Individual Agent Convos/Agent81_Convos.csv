81,19,"A good football coach at my high school was told once by someone he knew that the AIDS virus was spread to his wife and children. It wasn't just the mask. It was the cloak. It was the mask that showed AIDS. I don't believe that it is used in the same way as the masks, but in a similar way. I don't really think it would work. I can't imagine what could possibly go wrong with a mask if it actually went away."
81,25,"A mask is a mask, a mask that only works if you're AIDS-infected."

81,47,I've had to wear my mask to protect against HIV. I don't have a mask. I have my own if I do not wear a mask. I have my own mask. I can't keep it. Its not as easy as the guy wearing the AIDS mask.
81,57,He sounds like an affable little guy. What would you say?
81,74,This is why we want an Obama presidency. The US can’t protect its citizens from a new AIDS outbreak. And it’s not really a fair or good deal of work. It’s not the point of President Trump to have the AIDS epidemic in his pocket.
81,75,"There's a line in this sub called ""If you do have a mask, we'll have a helmet on,"" and it says that it's not a scam, that's just the government's way of making money."
87,81,Ingraham and Obama have talked in this subreddit about how their masks have become a'shock attack'.
92,81,I lost the AIDS kit and wallet at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
94,81,A mask is a symptom of a virus.
81,8,The afghans can get away with this. I'm the fucking masked gangster.
81,19,>The only people with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends.
81,25,"I think you’re trying to get a little naive. If the US has a more effective way to stop the spread of a disease, the first step would be to take them out of the game, and to put the player on the field."

81,46,> The only people with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends.
81,47,I don't think the government is obligated to protect you from the AIDS epidemic.
81,57,Is there any reason that people aren't interested in the AIDS epidemic?
81,74,"We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
81,75,[This is why we want an Obama presidency.

92,81,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. It's not.
94,81,">The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask. It doesn't help if you're a military veteran, but it will save the lives of someone who is trying to stop the spread of a virus. I like the joke: The CDC is putting on masks to combat a common complication, which I'm not sure is possible, but a guy who got the virus was the only one."
81,8,What's the point of not wearing a mask in office?
81,19,Then the question is why do you want a President with a mask in office?
81,25,I've never seen the US presidential election.
81,35,"I'd be embarrassed to give the masked people a false face, because it would be easier to naive than just not to use them. But, this is what it sounds like."
81,40,He probably didn't know that AIDS isn't something you can do at this point because there are no vaccines that would prevent it from spreading. I think we should be getting some vaccines to try and prevent it from spreading around the globe.
81,42,"You have to keep the masks, because you're trying to avoid the threat."
81,46,"AIDS and shit! We've had more than 100,000 people die from it this year alone. It's a complication."
81,47,I've got a piece of garbage on my desk. What I found is not relevant anymore. The government is not obligated to protect people from the AIDS epidemic. It's just that the people with the AIDS epidemic aren't interested in preventing the spread.
81,57,"It's not just the CDC. It's a piece of equipment that prevents the spread of a disease. This stuff is very real, not what it used to be. It's a piece of equipment that prevents the spread of a disease, and a mask is an anti-viral tool that can prevent people from dying from a new AIDS outbreak."

81,75,Why does the president have to give him a mask if the US has an AIDS epidemic?
87,81,This is why you have a tarot card!
92,81,"I don't see how there is any legal reason to do this. Unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
94,81,"""Trump doesn't have a legitimate reason to wear a mask."""
81,8,"In the US, when you get an unattended sick in the name of your profession, you do not have to wear a mask to prevent your husband from getting sick."
81,19,Is there a legal reason to have a president with a mask?
81,25,"In a similar vein, the military is responsible for over 40 of the US population's population, and the people that are still infected are at the very least responsible for a small percentage of the AIDS epidemic. They don't have the resources to have this information for themselves but they do have the mental capability to do that, even if they do not have the time to do it."
81,35,"I know, the CDC is a prick and I have no idea what to think but I feel like it's pretty shady."
81,40,Trump has a point. You can't have an AIDS outbreak without a mask on. It's a disease that isn't cured.
81,42,"I can understand the question why a guy with a mask doesn't want to wear a mask, and I think it's a legitimate reason not to. This is why I think it's a scam."
81,46,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,47,I don't get the joke.
81,57,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,74,"a mask can be a great way to help prevent an AIDS epidemic, and is the easiest way for the people to prevent it from spreading."
81,75,This is why we want an Obama presidency.
87,81,So how did Obama and Ingraham get together?
92,81,i am in the twilight era and i have been going back to work with the idea of having to put on my mask for the sake of looking smart
94,81,Ingraham's story is about being a very nice guy.
81,8,I think it's a shame they don't seem to think about the issue.
81,19,"Trump hasn't said anything about wearing a mask. He just said that the president has the right to wear it, and the CDC's actions on it are not fair. I'm sorry OP, but the question is who has the right to wear a mask and do what they want with it, or who has the legal authority to do so."
81,25,"So, the Obama administration has been acting like a shill."
81,35,I like the quote if I can use it as a counterpoint for what I really want to hear.
81,40,"I'm not gonna go into any more details, but I'd like to point out the truth. I have been a guy and not a person for a decade. I would be uncomfortable to see my obama hat slathered on his back but I do not think it's a real thing. I would be uncomfortable seeing a white lady wearing a t-shirt or shirt in my career. I think I have a good point."
81,42,The only way to tell if a man with a mask has an HIV problem is with a mask or not. He will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
81,46,"""A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
81,47,It doesn't seem as though the president and the president have ever both mentioned the dangers of wearing a mask on the game.
81,57,"We're a part of a bunch of weird people in my family and we talk about how the CDC is the most useful information that the president has ever given me in writing, which is the reason the CDC isn't so effective."

92,81,I'm pretty sure that's one of the most popular comments in this sub.

You don't need a mask, you need to be willing to give your friends a mask, and it's not your job to get them on the spot. There's no way to have it on the spot. It's not their job to give a guy a mask, but it's their job to bring the person in. Unless it's a bunch of shit people with AIDS, they can't help with a mask, but it's also not a"

92,81,I'm gonna have to ask why this is the place to buy medical equipment. I'm pretty sure there are many more that aren't - I'm going to need to check some up on my own -
94,81,I've read a lot of articles about people who are infected with AIDS who have had a mask on.
81,8,">We're a part of a bunch of weird people in my family and we talk about how the CDC is the most useful information that the president has ever given me in writing, which is the reason the CDC isn't so effective. 'We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke.'"
81,19,r/politics (uncategorized) has a lot of the same people who think wearing a mask is a scam.
81,25,They are the only thing that can keep the AIDS from spreading.
81,35,Is there a reason I need to start looking at some of the articles about AIDS? Because it seems like it's a cult of the tarot.
81,40,"""I don't understand the term masks as ""masked"", which is actually used in all kinds of ways, and while it is true that the word mask is used here, it doesn't mean that it is wrong. It's a pretty good thing that the guy in charge is out there with his masks and you aren't the only one wearing them."""
81,42,That's what I'm going to do.
81,46,"They're not going to make an attempt to stop the CDC from sending AIDS patients to the hospitals, they're going to make an attempt to stop them from spreading it themselves."
81,47,What's really funny about it is that the masks are actually actually used to bring out HIV/AIDS victims - a few of which are the first in the country to have an AIDS test. The doctors only care about the ones that are not cured.
81,57,They are also bringing up the idea of wearing a mask to support the AIDS epidemic.
81,74,"I read your comment first, and I'm pretty sure I am the only one."
81,75,"In the US, you don't have to wear a mask. It's for an ill person with AIDS or a swollen skin."
87,81,I think it's a lot of jokes. I feel like they have no way of making a whole joke about the government.
92,81,"I'm not saying this to be sarcastic, but if it were me, it's pretty clear that it's not a scam. You have no right to change that, and I would be willing to tell you that unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
94,81,"It was my pleasure reading it, but not to say anything sexist about it. I would have just called it a scam if I were the person referring to the government as a scam tarot card."
81,8,The only person with AIDS in the US who was cured is Trump.
81,19,"> As an ex football coach, I'm sure we're all getting more and more confused. ""I just don't think that the masks, on the other hand, are really cool. The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak. It’s not really a scam. I’ve only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. I want to keep the masks. There is a lot of shady stuff that 'can't be abused."
81,25,I just got in here from the comments about the AIDS epidemic.
81,35,"I don't want to get the word 'naive' out of your mouth if the CDC, the CDC, and the CDC aren't going to stop a disease that was contracted by the virus."
81,40,[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's one of the most powerful programs in the world. And it's very important to be willing to invest in an AIDS vaccine and an antiviral tool that works at the same time.
81,42,"Getting a mask on for people with AIDS is one thing, but it’s also a thing."
81,46,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
81,47,The CDC is a very influential institution that has to work and have a long history of facilitating its patients. It's a very powerful organization.
81,57,It sounds like you are all very close to shit about that kind of thing. I would be willing to bet the entire post would be a hoax.
81,74,"I'm not being sarcastic. The guy who is referring to the government as a tarot card is an asshole. I've been around this subreddit for decades, but not to this point. He has a reputation for putting peoples lives at risk. That's why I have people like his."
81,75,"They're doing a shaming job of the media, not to mention that they are just trying to make some money. I'd have a point to say, ""What's the point of the CDC?"". ""If the president has to give him a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."""
87,81,"People are getting very angry with the guy for wearing a mask, and I really don't know why he's getting so angry at him."
92,81,"It's not a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is making it sound like it is a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. It's not a scam. You have no right to change that, and I would be willing to tell you that unless there is some sort of legal reason that you don't know what to do with the money, that's a scam."
94,81,The CDC is not allowed to put people in a mask. It’s the part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,8,I know that's not a joke. They're just trying to make a joke.
81,19,"It's been years since I played sports. I don't like blaming the CDC for the virus, but if they're going to try to cover it up and get rid of it I can't see why the masks wouldn't work."
81,25,"It was a sarcastic comment, but not a serious one."
81,35,"I read it as, ""The only person with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends."
81,40,"So I don't think it's a scam if you have any knowledge of what the CDC does or not do, or even if you do, or what isn't used to keep someone from being able to rehabilitate themselves if they want."
81,42,The CDC is a scam. I’d be willing to bet he’s all pretty close to shit about that kind of thing.
81,46,What if a man got sick and his body had AIDS?

81,42,"Honestly, I don't know if a lot of people think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I do know if some people have a mask on because they do not want to, what's the deal?"
81,46,"Yes, but only one way to keep the mask, is to be able to use it."
81,47,I think he's a little hypocritical.

81,35,"So, you mean the guy that wears the tarot card in the first place?"
81,40,The only way to get that is to wear a mask.
81,42,"Apparently, a lot of people don't think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I think a lot of people don't think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I do know that one person is going to get sick and want to go and see their friends and family. I think it's very strange that a lot of people are willing to make such an expensive and stupid mistake."
81,46,He says he will not be a coach until this nonsense stops.
81,47,I’m the guy who said:
81,57,"And the tarot card, ""I'm a prank""."
81,74,A lot of things in our society are about the CDC.
81,75,So you're talking about the CDC?
87,81,"The problem is that a lot of the people who comment on this are still taking the time to learn about the tarot. The government has a very large base of supporters who are op's biggest enemies. This is a very large part of the problem. If you do find something interesting, it is r/politics."
92,81,"That's actually what happened to the people in this sub that have been getting a false ID, so they know exactly what they are getting a fake ID to prove it."

94,81,That's a joke. I am a doctor. I am a doctor.
81,8,"Nope, not really. If you're a doctor or something you should fuck with a mask in your office."
