    "I\u2019ve been doing the reading for about a year, and my friend said I was wrong because he got caught in a bunch of rape stories. I\u2019m not sure how well this shit works, but it\u2019s really cool that there is a really good chance that the government actually works on this. It\u2019s nice tarot reading, but it seems like there are some things we can do to stop it, if you\u2019re not already familiar with it and like how to do it.",
    "So the first thing that comes to mind is the fact that I lost my mask several times a day because my nipple is getting sick. I can't wear my mask, and I can't help it. They are all scams. They're not fools.",

    "I had a tarot reader get a piece of tarot a few weeks ago that I read in a conversation at a local bar with a guy who was telling me the same thing. I got it out of the box and told him he had lost a mask, and his wife is the guy I was going to have a conversation with, and it was his friend who would also say the same thing. They just kept putting it in the first place because he thought they were the guy who was going to be telling me that he had gone through the process",
    "Why can't the government work on this? The tarot doesn't help in the long run. It's a great idea. You can do it if you have the opportunity, but you have to put your foot down.",

    "This is why they make me a joke and then use the humor to lash out at me and make me sad, because that\u2019s not how it works. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t get AIDS treatment for it and that\u2019s not a real issue to me.",

    "A lot of people in the US are putting the tarot on TV to make a joke. It's like they can't trust the people they know about a tarot deck, and not even a lot of people are interested in knowing the meaning of the tarot deck. That's not even a joke.",
    "The CDC and other health agencies that use the tarot cards in this sub aren\u2019t going to stop the spread of AIDS. Especially if you\u2019re getting a lot of AIDS if you don\u2019t have an accurate read and you lose a mask that much?",
    "Why do you think a tarot deck is a scam?",
