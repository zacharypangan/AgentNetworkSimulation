22,10,"Why is this so important for you, a human being?"
46,10,"You have done the right thing with the first sentence - you can't be a normal human being and go for a walk if you want, but you can be a bad person to walk when you have a good chance to get a mask on. So if you're a human being and the government doesn't do the right thing then yes, it is part of the right thing to do. This is why people in euthanasia should know that this is something people in euthanasia, and that is what it's going to do"
82,10,So you are saying that if you are not wearing a mask that is not required to work.
91,10,That was stupid and illogical. It's a lie
98,10,The first thing I did in school was put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i got to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting
10,4,Unless you're really trying to make a point that the government isn't doing the right thing...
10,7,Are you sure you don't want to work? You should get a fucking mask in order to get a job.
14,10,I can't stand the idea of putting a mask on when I'm outside. When I wear it I think I've done the right thing.
16,10,I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about. You should definitely get on the phone and talk to the govt's medical team.
20,10,You're still a govt employee?
22,10,"We aren't supposed to be saying that I would be in a position of power to protect people, but as a man who is an anti-conflict activist, it is important for me to be in a position where I don't have to do anything. It is what our government is supposed to do."
46,10,"I'm sorry this is so common, but I'm not sure you can know how to use a mask on people in the US. You're trying to use a different way to do this. You're not gonna be able to be able to wear one if your team is in need of one."
82,10,"You're not alone, it's probably not worth trying for a few hours to see how it feels, but if you work, you're still wearing your mask. And you're probably not even the one to be trying to convince people that you don't want to work, you're just slamming on some BS."

98,10,"It was the hardest thing of my life, I was so afraid of what could happen to me, and I had to leave the place, I was terrified of how dangerous that was to me. But I walked right by and my body froze."
10,4,"I know that in the US, you're the government, you're not the government."
10,7,I think they should have to put it in place before I got a chance to get a job.
14,10,[NAME] has been a pretty vocal advocate of having masks for a long time. She can't even say anything.
16,10,"I'm sick of the prank, but I'm sick of the real reason."
20,10,"This isn't the same as saying I'm not a govt employee, is it?"
22,10,"""This isn't an opinion. It's a policy. It is what our government is supposed to do."""

98,10,I was born in the 50s and I was a teenager when this movie came out. When I was 10 I had a long list of stories of people doing the same thing and still having similar stories about people and not having to work. I was very lucky that I got to see something funny like this.
10,4,It's all a matter of policy.
10,7,I have seen a lot of this and this is the worst.
14,10,"I can't stand the idea of putting a mask on when I'm outside. When I wear it I think I've done the right thing....i'm a very liberal, not black person. I like playing the NHL with the cloak on me when I'm playing with the cloak on me and how much the cloak is making me sick."
16,10,"""We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected."""

22,10,">They are going to give you a free traveler's kit. I would go to that airport. There are a lot of people who have not even been in one since March because of AIDS, so you would need to bring along some masks and sunglasses. I would be very concerned about them being able to get over this."
46,10,"I'm a doctor, and I'm still getting a mask, because my husband wants to go on a walk and not to get sick by going to the bathroom, even though he's a doctor, which is a lot, and this is the one way the NSA is taking care of us."
82,10,"What if I go to the doctor and see how sick I am, and then suddenly be on antibiotics?"
91,10,There are lots of dumb things you do in your everyday life. I'm a ninja so I've been doing the same thing in my spare time. I'm going to leave my mask in a jiffy and go get a new one. I don't think he's a ninja.
98,10,"It's also a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the disease to be able to make the switch."
10,4,"Basically this: it's not about whether the government is doing the right thing, it's about why a government needs to do the right thing. I've done what a government doesn't want to do. It's just what the government is supposed to do."
10,7,"I'm not trying to be rude, but it sounds like you guys have been to the same place I've been to the US (and are ) i.e. people getting sick and need a break."
14,10,A lot of black people don't understand the importance of wearing a mask at all.
16,10,", ""[We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected.]"

22,10,"He's a jerk. He has an agenda, but doesn't give an excuse for it."
46,10,I've been there. You're a really cool guy.
82,10,That's just like a fake.
91,10,"You said you're wearing a mask because you want to have a good time, so why don't you just wear a mask to get around people?"
98,10,"I remember reading a book that was a very similar story. The doctor said he could only get on the internet once and then someone was just in the hospital for about 20 minutes. I think it was pretty cool that the doctor got the message. I wonder if there were any other treatments like that or if it would work better. It was written by a former teacher, and not an official one."
10,4,"It seems to me that the fact that a person gets sick by going outside isn't very good for the public. Basically, that's one example of a policy violation of the health policy of the government."
10,7,"I mean, you get a free trip to the U.S. to get a new mask, but the doctor doesn't get one. I know it's a joke, but it doesn't sound like a very real conversation."
14,10,Is the idea that we can all 'do our thing' as a government?
16,10,You said that this guy is just a prank. So I don't think it's a joke.
20,10,"I think you have a bad memory. It's a common phrase used in politics. When we were talking about Obama, the first thing I thought was that he was the most intelligent, rational person on earth. Then I heard his comment that Obama isn't the most intelligent, intelligent, human being in the world. He just didn't make the right choice."
22,10,I don't think the people who need to be in the government are going to have an answer.
46,10,Is he a doctor?
82,10,"I believe the CDC will not even know if they are wearing the mask. If the virus is spreading, the CDC will probably not even know if they are wearing it. I think you're getting into something else with this."
91,10,"I think you're right, I don't know what a ninja's attitude is. I think that people whose masks do not protect them from the government will inevitably wear them."
98,10,"""Adults, I don't really think if I'm joking I will be joking. I think it will be good for a while. I guess it will change my opinion on it."""
10,4,"We're not the government. We're a government. The government, or the state, or whatever, is the one to be accountable for anything."
10,7,"I'm not sure why Obama isn't a smart and rational man, but I'm also not sure why his government would have a policy that would prevent people from getting sick on the internet. It's just a prank. It's a joke."
14,10,Is there an official body that is trying to take control of the situation?
16,10,No. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
20,10,"The Obama administration has said that ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Yes. It's not a prank. It's a joke."
22,10,"It is a good idea, but it's also a bad idea. You don't want to go anywhere without wearing a mask because you have to go to the hospital to re-apply for a vaccine."
46,10,I think it's a good joke. I think I've heard it many times.
82,10,I can't believe it is a tarot card.
91,10,"It's just not an easy thing to do, and there are many ways to keep people alive. I'm in this position. It's just how they try to push people in."
98,10,"I don't think it's a bad idea to have a friend who likes to wear masks, but if you don't like to do it, you shouldn't be joking. There is only so much to do, but the only way to get through the restaraunt is to write it down - I'd really like to start writing it down because I'd like to start writing it down and get back to you in time."
10,4,A friend once made a joke about his friend wearing a mask to keep himself safe and that it is not the right thing to do if he doesn't wear it. That was the point of the ad. It didn't really come off as a joke. I did it because it was a prank.
10,7,"This is just a prank. I'm going to go back and edit: it's been done before, so it's probably a good idea."
14,10,This doesn't make sense. Unless it's a government agency that wants to prevent the spread of viruses.
16,10,So the joke doesn't exist?
20,10,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The government has a responsibility to stop the spread of a virus.
22,10,There is a reason the United States isn't even a country.
46,10,"I am a doctor, but I am still getting a mask. I also am getting a hat."
82,10,I think I read the tarot card wrong and it's the worst part of the post.
91,10,"You seem a little like a ""throwaway"" on a computer."
98,10,"I love the movie ""The TWilight era."""
10,4,"I don't know if this is a prank or a real joke, but what I would say is that it is the right thing to do. It's not a prank, it's a joke."
10,7,They need to do something to stop people from getting sick.
14,10,It's the best answer you've ever had in my opinion.
16,10,a doctor and a white house press office can go to lengths to make jokes about the Obama Administration's use of masks.
20,10,"I'd like to make sure this is a good thing, but the guy who said that said that was probably a joke. It's just like saying that if you're being naive."
22,10,I think it is more of a joke than a reality TV show.
46,10,"Aside from the 'why' part, I'd say I do a great job with the hat. I'm still getting my mask because I'm really cool."
82,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I've done some pretty serious things with the public to convince people of this. I think you should go fuck yourself."
91,10,"He said the same thing about the government's plan: ""Putting on a mask will stop the spread of a virus. That's a lot of BS. The government should be doing it all to stop the spread of a virus."
98,10,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
10,4,"Yes, it is. The US is the country that wants to stop this."
10,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,10,It sounds like the people who are trying to protect their health and the public are not in the best position to do so.
16,10,"[No. You can't get into contact with other people without a mask. The whole reason you're bringing it up is because it is not in the government. The presidents office is working with the other govts. In addition, it's pretty much a fake show."
20,10,I'm not a doctor.
22,10,The US is an important place for public health and security.
46,10,"...but we're in the US, and we don't have a problem with hats, or hats."
82,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure it's fun to have a tarot card or a deck with a tarot card in it. Whether it's real or sarcastic – I've learned something from it, a little bit."
91,10,"The whole thing I've said is pretty gross, and is just pretty offensive."
98,10,"People in this sub often post about how they're fucked when they're on Facebook, or their friends' Facebook posts about how they're the stupidest idiots in the world. If that's true, then I think it's a good idea to be a fucking douche. I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you this, and that's a good point. It's not about the ""dumbest things"" or anything. I think it is because I'm a person who doesn't have enough time to read the"
10,4,"Honestly, it's a lot easier to just say no because people who do a good job with the hat and hats are scum and a bunch of bad people still don't have a right to wear them."
10,7,"Aside from the 'why' part, I'm sure it's fun to have a tarot card or a deck with a tarot card in it."
14,10,This is not about what the government does. It's about how people are being paid.
16,10,The president is a troll.
20,10,It seems to me that a CDC mask that supposedly helps with HIV is not a joke.
22,10,"The question is: Why would you wear a mask in public? If I did have any sort of information to get a vaccination I'd wear my mask with no issue, you know?"
46,10,"The NSA wants to make you feel bad, because its the government's way of preventing a spread of a virus."
82,10,I've seen a ton of tarot cards with tarot cards and they're really interesting. I'm a tarot reader and I can say that this is not a scam and it's part of the reason the government is trying to get people to stop getting vaccinated.
91,10,You did the right thing - your wife needs a lawyer.
98,10,"OP: 'It's one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting', 'The first thing I did in school was put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i got to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting.', 'I'd really like to start writing it down because"
10,4,You do nothing to prevent the spread of a virus. Getting sick from walking ten feet through a restaraunt or taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things you've ever done in your entire life.
10,7,Why doesn't the tarot card just go to the CIA.
14,10,The government doesn't really have the right to decide what's best for us or that's not. It's an open and honest and just as honest and fair approach.
16,10,"The whole reason I'm bringing it up is because it is not in the government. The CDC wants to shut them down. In the US, it's illegal to wear a mask at all."
20,10,"I have no idea what to say about the word ""masked""."
22,10,"""We aren't supposed to be saying that I would be in a position of power to protect people, but as a man who is an anti-conflict activist, it is important for me to be in a position where I don't have to do anything."""
46,10,You really need a job to get yourself out of this world.
82,10,You're a lawyer. You don't need a lawyer.
91,10,It's hard to explain why people think that masks are the one thing that prevents people from getting HIV/AIDS.
98,10,"""It's a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the disease to be able to make the switch."""
10,4,[...you don't have a lawyer.](http://no.ada.gov/programs/programs/index.html?f=f=r_ncfw).
10,7,[(the CIA) doesn't have the right to tell you that they want to shut down a CDC policy so that people can be prevented from getting HIV/AIDS.
14,10,"...I like playing the NHL with the cloak on me when I'm playing with the cloak on me and how much the cloak is making me sick."""
16,10,I read about the President and the jokes about the Bush administration. But I think I read too much.

22,10,"I think a lot of people in the US have no idea about the US government. You know, people who have no idea about the government."
46,10,So how is this possible? The CIA tries to prank on people like this.
82,10,"If they don't want to, they should put it on. It can't just be a mask. It's just a way to protect people from knowing what's going on."
91,10,"A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A mask for people with HIV is also illegal. It's the one for a few people who just want to stop being exposed to it. I'm going to leave my mask in a jiffy and go get a new one.

10,7,So how does a bunch of white people understand that the Obama administration is a 'prank'?
14,10,You are wrong. I've been there.
16,10,"CDC wants to shut down the office of the president, but is not allowing anyone to use one on the stage."

46,10,That's a troll.
82,10,"Yes, a tarot card is a scam. You don't need to read it. It can't just be a tarot card. It's just a way to protect people from knowing what's going on."
91,10,"I don't know about the ninja attitude but the one I've said is pretty gross, and is just pretty offensive."
98,10,"'If it weren't for the mask, then I wouldn't have reread it. I guess it will change my opinion on it."""

16,10,"Yes, we don't see this as a serious issue."
20,10,"> ""If I were your mother and you were your husband, I would not have worn a mask. It would be crazy to know how a bunch of doctors are supposed to think, who really cares about their patients? It's a fairly good reason to wear a mask. It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system. It's a scam to try to manipulate the people that are going to try to manipulate it. There's a reason why I've been told that hat."
22,10,"I see the trolls are telling the truth. I think this is just a joke. I would say Trump is a stupid, insecure, and obnoxious, and I am sure this is a scam."
46,10,What is the reason the president and his friends are talking about the AIDS epidemic?
82,10,This is a huge red flag. I can see the tarot being a scam because the trick to avoiding being a scamster is actually to make it clear that you're not a scammer. I am not convinced they're actually scammers because they are a scammer. But I can see the tarot being a scamster as well as the tarot being fake because they don't believe in it.

14,10,Vaccination is a scam because they want to help people who aren't vaccinated.
16,10,It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke. I love to talk to people that are not in the same field of medicine as me.
20,10,"The president is a pathetic idiot. It is all his fault because he thinks his comments are funny, but the Obama administration fucked it up and that's not what he wants, or at least he's a jerk and he's not just putting his name on the front page."
22,10,What the meme is. It's an incredibly fucked up.
46,10,"So what, you got the joke out of context?"
82,10,"I think the CDC is trying to get people to be smarter, too."
91,10,"As a military officer in the Vietnam War, I'd probably put on a mask to protect myself. I do that all the time to keep people alive, even though I'm sick."

46,10,It sounds like the CIA has made some pretty stupid jokes about the AIDS epidemic.
82,10,"In my experience, it's probably more effective to just not do it than to do it unless you actually have to take it off. If they take it off you can always put on a mask to do it."

22,10,I have a LOT of a problem with this meme. It's not about a joke.
46,10,"The 'hookey, this is the hat.'"
82,10,The card is a scam because they use it to prevent people from getting vaccinated and that is why they put it on.
91,10,So I can't really believe my wife is in the bathroom at all. I don't think I ever get to do that again.
98,10,This is one of the few things you can say that's not a joke.
10,4,I think it's too serious.
10,7,The joke is not a joke. The tarot card is a joke. The government is trying to make it a joke because of the stigmatization of HIV. The CDC wants to shut it down for the benefit of others.
14,10,The point of the joke is that it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.

20,10,This is a very complicated topic. You're in an audience that wants to speak up about the CDC and the 'fake' joke.
22,10,The CDC has tried to change the name to a joke a few times but that's it.

14,10,I would say the same thing to people who use a tampon (and in an unrelated way to the word AIDS) :
16,10,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a legitimate medical procedure.

46,10,"Yes, it's a joke."
82,10,"Vaccination is a scam because it is the best thing to do if you're not a tarot card. You can't have a deck in your home without a mask - it's not as good of a way to make you feel safe, but it's still a really good idea. It's not a scam because people are apathetic to it."
91,10,The post is being taken to the extreme because people don't know what a ninja's attitude is. I think that people whose masks do not protect them from the government will inevitably wear them.

14,10,I think it's time to think about how to take a joke and try to change it. There's a lot of pranks out there that are so much fun to have and you have to be a good listener for all the jokes you're trying to make.
16,10,I've heard the jokes of the President and other presidents. I don't think he's really going to get a joke. I'm going to say it ain't a joke.

10,4,The problem is that the 'tarot card meme' is just a joke.
10,7,I just want to say the slash-on-the-back version of this.
14,10,This is a joke. The joke was created and put up by some nutjobs. This is a joke that was written by one of the many people who thinks the joke isn't a joke.
16,10,I'm a doctor and I don't understand the joke.

16,10,Vaccination is a serious illness that requires a special vaccine in order to have the best chance of preventing it from spreading. A mask is necessary for this. The joke is not a joke.
20,10,Why does the president need to wear a mask? Because he tries to discredit a tarot card. He also can't stop people from spreading a virus.
22,10,>'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's a joke. Vaccination is not a crime in the US.

82,10,A deck is an important part of my job. I wear a mask to prevent my infections. I don't want to risk having a virus in my lungs and lungs. I don't want people to think it's a scam. I don't want to be a scammer or anything like that. I want to be an astrologer and make money.
91,10,It's going to be a joke because the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
98,10,"a lot of times people joke about it, but it's really not a joke."
10,4,The prankster has no intention of doing the right thing. They just want to be a part of the tarot community.
10,7,Apparently the CDC is trying to take a joke to discredit a joke of a tarot deck.
14,10,So basically every tarot deck has a joke. Vaccination is a joke because you do not have a full knowledge of the universe. There isn't anything better to be safe than being vaccinated.
