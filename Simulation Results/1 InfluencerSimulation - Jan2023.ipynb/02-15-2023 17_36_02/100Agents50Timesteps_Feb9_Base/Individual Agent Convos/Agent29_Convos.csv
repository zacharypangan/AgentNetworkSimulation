53,29,I hope that people will get a better understanding of what it's like to be in a mask for as long as you can. I'm not sure that it's bad to wear a mask when you can't see clearly in public.
70,29,This is the most obvious scam.

84,29,"I'd like to add to my comment that while wearing a mask you are supposed to wear a mask to walk through a restaraunt and then take it off when you get to your table and it's not a bad idea, it's more than good idea to use a mask to walk through a restaraunt.

29,26,"You are in the wrong section of the post to read, and a lot of people will be confused by your statement. What does it say, if you are not willing to explain to someone why a person does not have a helmet, but wants to wear a mask?"
44,29,Why do people not wear masks?
49,29,I think you're mistaken. This is why I like it. It's a great article and you have so many good points to offer.

70,29,"It’s the only thing that counts. The truth is, even if you are vaccinated and you don’t have a mask on, you have no protection against the virus."
76,29,TIL the US has no mandates to protect your face from twitch and a virus.
84,29,Are you from the states? Where do you live?
85,29,I was a child and the last time I ever tried to wear a mask it was 4 years ago. It works like a charm.
29,17,"This was posted in r/Rosevelt. The article is about a man who wears a mask when he's on the field and he's wearing a mask and a mask in a public place, not being able to see in public - I am sure he's a prick, and I'm sure there are people that will think about wearing a mask when they 'carry' it around while they're out and about. He's also in the field with some good news."
29,26,I know it's scary but I never think people are going to wear the mask again. Whether that s the case or not I can't really think of anything else.
44,29,I feel like I have to say something to the effect of I want to wear my mask when he's in the hospital. What I would do is not say it to him in public.
49,29,The government has made it clear that the people in charge of the US are infecting people.
52,29,I'm a hysterical child.
53,29,"I think that ""in a world that has already seen this nonsense, we must be making it clear that this issue should not be resolved immediately."""
70,29,I'm going to tell you something about the vaccine.
76,29,"Well a doctor can tell a virus has a long term effect on people like you. If you wear a mask, it's not the problem. So this explains why the government is allowing a narcotic to spread in the form of smoke. It's a myth, and I'm not sure it's true."
84,29,I'm from New York.
85,29,"Oh, so, you've lost your mask for 4 years. So, you don't have to wear it. You don't need to wear a mask? If you're not, then don't wear a mask. You're going to have trouble breathing properly. It will not work as well if you don't wear a mask."

29,26,"My husband insisted on wearing a helmet when he was young and had been working with him for three years. He was sick, and so when he told me he would need to get it back he said, ""Hey, I have a helmet on, I think I can help you but I want to wear my mask, I'm not a doctor and I can't be a teacher."""
44,29,i think there is a lot of good news. a lot of people in hvac are saying it as a way to help with the issue
49,29,"I'm a physician, and I have a degree in epidemiology."
52,29,>They said it was illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of a virus.
53,29,"I mean, the ""why"" of being able to put on a mask and get around it and walk on it. Unless they want to protect you from it, I'd just let you go. I've gotten a lot of bad information. Thats why I wear a mask. The first sentence is absolutely pathetic. I think it's funny because you made up your mind to take it in the way it does."
70,29,">That is really interesting. Having a mask, being a snooping public figure is the best way to stop a virus spreading in a public place."
76,29,"Vaccination has a long term effect on people like you. If you wear a mask, it's not the problem. So this explains why the government is allowing you to be so selfish and selfish. What do you mean ""put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt""?"

49,29,>The issue I'm referring to here is that I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on at all.

85,29,"[Person who has been caught in the past with a mask, it seems like a weird idea."

53,29,"I'm not going to be an expert, but this is very interesting. I'd read the whole article and see how it feels. It's like you're saying that people who aren't aware of the dangers of the virus, because it's an unprovoked fact, are not aware of the dangers in the human body. The entire article is filled with facts, which makes sense to me. It doesn't really mean anything."
70,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,29,"I think there is a problem with your mask, and this is the one that has been used for years."
84,29,I was told in a news interview that the people who say the vaccines don't apply to everyone and who are not vaccinated can go to a medical school to get one for their kids.
85,29,"I can't even find any other advice for this, but I'll be honest when I ask people who have a problem with a mask. I have never gotten sick."
29,17,"It's a myth and it's not true, and it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't sound like a problem to me."
29,26,"I'm actually from Ohio, so I'm not familiar with the jokes."
44,29,This is a lot more important than the vaccine unless there is a medical reason.
49,29,"> As a former doctor in the US, I am so sorry to hear about this."
52,29,"The government is trying to push people into a war of words to stop the spread of AIDS. If they go the way of a joke, they will end it."
53,29,Is the government going to put on the mask to prevent a virus? I can't think of a better way to say that.
70,29,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,29,">I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted. But if they say anything negative about the mask, then you are an idiot."
84,29,"I’m not saying this is dumb, but I also haven’t seen anything like this happen, except a bunch of people on a bus who can’t put on a mask."
85,29,"As someone who has been caught in the past with a mask, I don’t see how people can make it a prank. And it’s just a prank. If it weren’t for the mask, that would probably be infuriating."
29,17,"I'm sorry, but this is one of the very worst things about this country:"
29,26,"I am so sorry. The joke isn't true. If a person wears a mask, the government will be telling the truth. The government is trying to keep people from expressing fear. The government is trying to end it."
44,29,Vaccination is a big deal. People need a mask if they want to stop an outbreak or to fight it.
49,29,"We're talking about the CDC and the CDC, not the CDC."
52,29,The CDC is preventing the spread of AIDS.
53,29,I can't help but feel that your sarcastic comment is misplaced and misunderstood based on the fact that you know the truth.
70,29,"The NSA has a mandate that allows the CDC to be a credible agent in the fight against rape, because the mandate doesn't really make sense to them."
76,29,"A lot of the people in this sub are incredibly stupid and if they want to be honest, they are not."
84,29,I think a lot of people are taking it as a sign that a bunch of people don't have a problem with not vaccinating themselves and can't prevent any illness. Vaccinations in the US are not illegal in every state and it isn't a dick move. Its not a dick move.
85,29,What a fucking shit if you say it to your friends...
29,17,"The government is preventing AIDS, but you have no reason to think this is the answer to your question."
29,26,"... and I've read your post and you have no idea what the whole ""why"" thing is about."
44,29,"CDC has been in place for some time. So maybe you're not aware of it, but this is also one of the issues with the CDC and its staff. So, yes, I think there's a lot of good news."
49,29,"There are a lot of people who are getting AIDS. If they're trying to take care of themselves, the CDC will most likely have the right to do so. If the CDC doesn't, they're going to have to take care of themselves and take care of themselves. The question here is why is it a legitimate and necessary reason? Probably a good thing the CDC has the right to remove the mask and not the CDC."
52,29,"...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke."
53,29,This is just as silly as the guy you said - you're the CDC.
70,29,"This is how r/politics works. It is a good one, and the hat is very useful for showing a good sign, but it is not what is needed to keep people safe."
76,29,"If you can't wear a mask in public, then you are an idiot."
84,29,"Vaccination in the US is NOT illegal in every state. I am a doctor, and the problem is the lack of vaccine coverage. It’s not a big deal, and it is illegal for the government to take advantage of the public. It’s a huge problem."
85,29,As a child I had a hive mind. So I lost it and I don't even have it on at work. I am so sick I'm never sick because of it.
29,17,"The CDC can't force people to wear a mask, so it doesn't make sense."
29,26,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV.
44,29,"A lot of things have been stated about this, but you can't simply say something like ""Thanks Ctl Stay Safe friends and wear mask if need to go out."" If it's a problem, I'm not sure it's really worth it."
49,29,"A lot of people are getting AIDS as a result of wearing a mask. They are not getting vaccinated as a result of being infected with a virus. They are getting a vaccine from people who already get the virus, and are getting infected with AIDS through their medical school."
52,29,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
53,29,No sarcasm.
70,29,The way the president does things and you want to stop the spread of a virus is just stupid.
76,29,"People who are not interested in the CDC and the health care system, do not trust the CDC to do their own research or provide information about HIV."
84,29,"It's not illegal in every state, but it should be a thing in the rest of the country. It isn't a big deal."
85,29,"I have a phobia where it's not a joke but it's really creepy. You can't have a phobia without it, but you can't have a phobia without it. I'm sorry."
29,17,I've seen the entire video - I've read it a few times.
29,26,"I think you are correct. Vaccination is illegal, but the CDC has a right to ban it."
44,29,This has been discussed and discussed in a lot of different ways. Among them: Vaccination is a big deal. People need to wear them if they want to stop the spread of a virus.
49,29,"A lot of people are getting AIDS as a result of wearing a mask. They are not getting vaccinated as a result of being infected with the virus, and are getting infected with AIDS through their medical school. "
52,29,"He was in the interview with a woman who was the spokesperson for the CDC on a piece of tarot, despite being a huge tarot follower."
53,29,"The thing is, a lot of people get a mask on themselves. Those people wear them on their days off and it doesn't affect their work."
70,29,The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus.
76,29,"I have had a guy who went to the doctor and told me he has an infection and he thinks he has a brain infection. He did so and said, ""I feel better. I think I have the same reaction if my face gets caught in the wind."" I was so scared."
84,29,"If you are a doctor and are unable to get an injection for an illness, you're going to need a second opinion."
85,29,There are people with a phobia that have no idea how to manage it. And I think the only answer to that is to not wear a mask.
29,17,"I've never been able to do a 'face mask' as a result of wearing one before. I'm afraid that is not the way you'make'a joke, because the truth is, even if you're vaccinated and don't have a helmet, you've got no protection against the virus."
29,26,This is the one piece of information that is being debunked.
44,29,Vaccination is a big deal. People need to wear them if they want to stop an outbreak or to fight it.
49,29,"It was a nice one, but very naughty."
52,29,"AIDS is a virus. A virus. A disease. A virus. A virus. A virus. AIDS is not a disease. It's a problem because of the fact that people still wear masks to prevent the spread. '...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke.' '...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke.'"
53,29,This article has been so interesting for us that I was able to pull it off and not get anything from it. It's funny.
70,29,-](http://www.cdc.gov/cdc/stpc/index.html?stpc=r&id=152967 It sounds like he's telling his buddies and co workers to be more open about it in this context.
76,29,"Thats just ridiculous. I have an infection and it's a huge, massive problem."
84,29,"Vaccination is not illegal in every state, and it's illegal in every state, but it should be a thing in the rest of the country. It's a huge deal."
85,29,I am so glad the CDC has worked with the narcissists that they've identified with a real threat.
29,17,I read it and I'm not sure why anyone would ask about it. Its a joke and there is no such thing as being able to wear a mask if you are in an area where it isn't required.
29,26,>Is this what the CDC mandates?
44,29,"> I think it's funny that they are acting on a theme about a ""dead hvac epidemic"" -- it's actually the ""dead hvac epidemic"""
49,29,AIDS is not a disease if the virus isn't identified by the vaccine that prevents it from being transmitted to humans - the virus is not known for being a vaccine - and it isn't the CDC's fault.
52,29,It's not funny. It's a joke.
53,29,"The article says that the players aren't going to get back in shape, that's a huge red flag. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,29,"I've heard this in the news all day, but I'm more than a little worried about the virus."
76,29,"I think that I'm a pretty good person, and I'm not a nerd, but I've heard that that people aren't willing to go to a religious religious religious event because of the'medical issues' with vaccines and what they are willing to do. There isn't anything I can think of to show anyone who doesn't feel comfortable exposing themselves to any snooping shit that isn't just the CDC. But I do understand you have a problem with HIV and can't handle that."
84,29,I grew up in the states. I worked in the healthcare field.
85,29,I feel like the first part of the joke that he was using a symphony of a hive mind for a prank was pretty funny. It's more about his own mask being a joke than a prank.
29,17,I had a hs vaccinate my face. AIDS was still in a very high prevalence and I was not aware that it was a disease.
29,26,Vaccination is a big deal. People need to wear them if they want to stop an outbreak or to fight it. It's a huge deal.
44,29,They haven't had a mandate to get people in a hospital. They are not going to get it out of their systems and are trying to destabilize the situation. The CDC hasn't even had a mandate to get people in a hospital. Vaccination is a big deal.

70,29,"This is a good book, and a real one, and you're going to be amazed at how many people who believe that are actually trying to win a vote."
76,29,You're very much right about 'I don't feel comfortable exposing myself to snooping shit.'
84,29,>Vaccines aren't a good means to stop the spread of a virus.I like the 'we should' thing.
85,29,The CDC says that the 'Mask Me for a Friend' thing is part of a system in place for people with phobias.
29,17,"I mean, you know... It is a big deal to prevent infections. If people don't take it seriously, they are sick and have to be hospitalized."
29,26,I am the one who is trying to troll you. I am an idiot.
44,29,"I’m just saying, “I’m a doctor. I’m so tired of looking at my mask. I’ve got a new mask.”"
49,29,This is the most bizarre and interesting question in this thread.
52,29,"Honestly, I think Obama is a huge fan of all of the things you said, but in any case, I'm pretty sure this is one of the most disturbing things to happen in a man's life, and I think he might have some other problem:"
53,29,I've been in the sport.
70,29,"Well, I did a tarot book last week that got me up at 6am (Saturday, March 13th). It's great, and it is a bit of a joke. And when I do it, I say it's a prank. You're a prank. And I'm sure some skeptics think that's it."
76,29,"A virus has a long term effect. In fact, I have an infection. It is very dangerous. It was ejaculated in a large number of people, many of them in the 1980s and 90s."
84,29,"We should use the idea that if one woman is not vaccinated, the other person is going to be a huge health nut in the country. It's actually one of the most popular things I've ever heard. It's a pity that people are not doing anything to stop it, but it is kinda a big deal, because it's a joke."
85,29,"There's a good book about this, too, about a man who is trying to fuck up a sick kid by taking a mask off."
29,17,"My friend works with a CDC nurse, and I was told that if I have to use a mask to get it off I have to use a helmet. I volunteered to do a tarot reading about this as a way to make sure that the doctor is taking care of the sick person, and that it is important to do a test in the area that you work in, so I was told that when you do it you can get the shit done to the doctor and get it off or something."
29,26,"You're a genius, man."
44,29,"This is an interesting subject to discuss, because it could get into a bit of an interesting tense with the people who are trying to make fun of the people who have no idea."
49,29,"You've seen too much shit and the government is doing something wrong, right? Do you think they have a legitimate reason to remove the mask?"
52,29,"You can't say it's not funny. It's a joke, despite its content."
53,29,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The CDC will take the initiative, it's a joke, and it's going to help stop the spread of the virus. The CDC will take the initiative, and they will do so by getting the right people to protect them, and then by putting on their masks to keep their hands on the CDC."
70,29,And now I'm going to say this.
76,29,""" I don't understand why anyone would be buying a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, it's not a scam. It's a scam, but it's not a scam. They're just trying to push people in."""
84,29,"Vaccination is a prank, not a joke."
85,29,It is a joke that the government does not need to tell people.
29,17,Because people who have a nosebleed or other health conditions are going to come around with it.
29,26,And it hasn't been a joke.
44,29,It's not a joke.
49,29,People are so smug. I'd say it's a prank. But I do think it's a good thing the CDC has the right to remove it. It's not like a prank because the CDC and other things are wrong.
52,29,So I'm a guy with a phobia of Obama. I don't want to get vaccinated. I want to have a hive mind. This is a joke.
53,29,"The article is very disturbing, but you get an idea."
70,29,This is a prank. A prank that demonstrates how shady it is and why it's a prank is like the tarot card thing?
76,29,"I want to say that I have been here for about 10 years and you are right that you feel sorry for me, but that I can't do something if I feel like it."
84,29,Is this a spoof?
85,29,i feel like if a phobia is scary that would make it a joke. i would be unable to help anyone without a mask. it’s scary but i’d rather do nothing else than get sick.
29,17,It’s a joke.
29,26,You have been around for 10 years. I would tell anyone who reads it to be a genius.
44,29,Then tell the CDC that people are wrong to wear a mask and will not go back to their doctor.
49,29,"No, that's not why we have a monopoly. We have a monopoly on the internet and all the government actions they've taken are against the people and their moral compass."
52,29,I can't say that the joke is a joke. This guy is being called a liar. ''They said it is illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of a virus.''
53,29,"In his sarcastic comment, he says, ""I don't understand that I could get a mask on myself and walk on it."""
70,29,Considering the amount of r/tarot posts I read on this sub I have to wonder what the meaning of the whole thing is.
76,29,"I think he means that the CDC is involved with the spread of AIDS. They want people to know that that is a serious threat to their health and that the government is trying to push people into HIV. This is a scam. They need to get to the point where they will get a new mask. If he doesn't get it, he can't just buy one from someone who can, at least, help him."
84,29,A prank is not a prank. A prank is a joke.
85,29,"It sounds like you are not in any way in the UK. I am a phobia specialist, a medical professional, and have never been sick with a mask. I am so sick of having to wear one, and I will be in a very similar situation when i have a phobia. It can be funny, and scary enough to be worth a few thousand dollars."
29,17,"He was saying, ""Hey OP. I have a phobia of AIDS. Do you think I would be comfortable wearing a mask and getting sick?"""
29,26,">Then tell the CDC that people are wrong to wear a mask and will not go back to their doctor. No, that's not why we have a monopoly. We have a monopoly on the internet and all the government actions they've taken are against the people and their moral compass."
44,29,Vaccination is a serious disease. A mask is supposed to protect the players from a virus. A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus. A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus. A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus.
49,29,*It sounds like a prank. I think the CDC has the right to remove it. Probably a good thing the CDC has the right to remove it.
52,29,"I'm not sure where you are going with that, but it's kind of creepy IMO."
53,29,I am so happy this is how this hat is being used. I can hardly imagine someone wearing a mask as a joke. That is so immature. It's a joke to get around.
70,29,"> i do have to tell them, I guess. You mean ""We're the CDC, not the government."" I guess it's funny because they're saying it's like a tarot card."
76,29,The CDC is actually trying to push people in.
84,29,"I like the idea that if one person is not vaccinated, the other person is going to be a huge health nut in the country."
85,29,"I'm a phobia specialist, and a medical professional. I wear a mask all the time when I'm at work, but never once was it taken off because I've never had a problem with it."
29,17,It seems to be the way to do the things you are referring to in this subreddit - to not do them by themselves or their people. They are not a joke.
29,26,a lot of people will be confused by your statement. What does it say?
44,29,"It would be easy to get a dick in the ass and a mask without a mask. Vaccination is a flimsy and dangerous thing to wear unless you have health insurance. Having a mask is a very serious and dreaded idea, and I know people who wear masks all the time but in general I can’t believe how many times I’ve heard that it is a serious thing to wear."
49,29,This is a r/legaladvice topic. It’s not just this article about the CDC. It’s also about it being the wrong thing to do to people.
52,29,A joke – the real world.
53,29,I’m not in the CDC. AIDS has been around for over a decade. Vaccination has been the answer to nearly half of the deaths in the United States.
70,29,"It sounds like a prank. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus."""
76,29,"Well, there is a good chance that it can go viral."
84,29,I'm just going to go with the theory that the CDC should use the tarot cards instead.
85,29,"I think this is a good one. It sounds like a joke, and a great way to get rid of that. I hope it doesn't involve you."
29,17,I can't believe this is a joke.
29,26,"Vaccination is a serious and dangerous disease, and there is a huge stigma associated with it. There are also no vaccines for it. If they are a drug infected, that's a serious concern. And yes, the people with it are a major threat. I'd be concerned about how they get shit done."
44,29,"A CDC operative was hired to do a similar job, and she allegedly told his assistants she wanted to make a joke about her illness (i.e.: a hockey coach pranking on me). It was a big joke."
49,29,"The question is why they’ve done such a stupid, silly thing? They’ve said so much and we can’t be too far off. If we really don’t want this to get serious, a CDC doctor would have a legitimate reason to remove a mask that we don’t want everyone to see."
52,29,I think the idea is that I was a man in a hive mind with a phobia of Obama and a hive mind. It's not really funny despite all the humour they're using on it.
53,29,"I'm pretty sure the CDC, the largest body of research in the world, identifies as a national resource for the prevention of AIDS."
70,29,">I'm going to humbly say it: a good idea, a joke. So you've done a lot of dumb things in your life, not just done dumb things in your life?"
76,29,"""I'm a pretty good person, and I'm not a nerd, but I've heard that that people aren't willing to go to a religious religious religious event because of the'medical issues' with vaccines and what they are willing to do."
84,29,"I grew up in the states, and I’ve never seen anything like this happen. I’m surprised how often people get vaccinated without actually getting them. I also have no idea how many people have been infected."
85,29,"A good way to get rid of a phobia is to use a mask in the first place. If you're afraid of going outside in public with a mask, you can't go outside without a mask. There's nothing wrong with using a mask because you can't go outside and talk to strangers. So there's something you can do but it's not really a joke."
29,17,"AIDS isn’t a joke. It’s a horrible disease. It’s not just a prank. It’s an unforgivable disease. AIDS is the disease, not the vaccine. It is an unavoidable disease. It’s not a joke. It’s a serious disease. It’s not just a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
29,26,You've just learned what an insult it is. You don't have to be a doctor to get it.
44,29,I'm on an autism spectrum and we can't understand how we know the same thing about the CDC. Vaccination is an effective way of treating people who have an unprotected HIV infection - we need a mask that doesn't cover all the areas of the body where the illness is more likely to spread. The vaccine is an essential part of your life. You're gonna die in one piece and the disease is getting better. Your health is the issue and you're going to die in a few months.
49,29,"As a former CDC member, I'm so sorry that you had to hear about this."
52,29,"I can't even imagine a man walking down the street begging for a vaccine with a large black or black scar, and his wife trying to pretend he's not a real doctor."
53,29,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does.
70,29,I don't have a favorite book if it wasn't the one.
76,29,It's all going to be like the following:
84,29,"It's a joke, it's not a joke."
85,29,a lot of people have a phobia i think.
29,17,So what is the point of this post?
29,26,I've had the same problem in college when I was a doctor and I could afford to wear a mask with a black eye. It really helped me. I couldn't even eat for days when I was sick.
44,29,"I think they've been talking about a lot of different issues with their CDC, but I think the most important point is that the mask is the issue, not the reason. I just want them to know that the CDC has an authority to take a joke when talking about a joke."
49,29,"The article is just a reference to how the mask is the worst idea ever. Unless it's a joke, they're a prank."
52,29,I think he's using it as a joke to stop the spread of AIDS. What he did was just a joke.
53,29,"Yes, this is a joke, and this is what we call ""a joke."" I'd be fine with a prank because I don't get the joke, but I'm not going to be an expert, but this is something I'm not going to be aware of."
70,29,>The President is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It is the only way to get yourself vaccinated.
76,29,> What if I were you? It's all going to be like the following:
84,29,"My wife is in the CDC, she works in the healthcare industry. Her work involves dressing up like a man, and being a good patient. She does all kinds of stuff that puts you in a danger. We wear masks, she goes to a doctor and she gets vaccinated. We don't wear masks anymore. We are a public health organization. The CDC is a joke. I don't care what the public thinks."
85,29,I think the most effective way to get rid of a phobia is to be aware of the underlying problem with the phobia.
29,17,"I'm an idiot. If I had to guess, I'd have a question. Does the joke have a word?"
29,26,"As a former CDC member, I'm so sorry you had to hear about this."
44,29,That's why it's so big deal. The government doesn't have an authority to mandate the wear of masks.
49,29,"I don't think he's a good doctor. I'm really a doctor. I can make up a joke if I want. But I do think that there are some interesting, legitimate reasons for putting a mask on."
52,29,"A lot of people are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. I think people need to think of the real numbness of AIDS, or I think if you don't have any idea what it is you might just be misinformed."
53,29,The CDC is the joke. The fact that they are being taken seriously makes the joke pretty hilarious.
70,29,"I would take your first sentence as a very helpful one because I am going to be a lot less tame than I am today. It is just a joke. You can also just say it to myself. I'm not saying it's a joke, but it's an interesting example. I think that's a very clever way of explaining to someone why it's a prank."
76,29,"We have a lot of tarot cards, I'd use one at a party. Weird. Especially considering how many people have told me a prank about a man who is wearing a mask for a prank. I'm the.. I’m the.. I have a lot of tarot cards, I’d use one at the party. Weird. Especially considering how many people have told me a prank about a man who is wearing a mask."
84,29,"Well the message is, I don't care what the public thinks."
85,29,I've been in the hive mind and don't remember hearing the joke yet.
29,17,"CANNOTANSWER: ""A mask does not equal a helmet, and that is very dangerous. It is just a joke."""
29,26,"""The CDC has a right to ban it."""
44,29,"I don't think the person was having any problem with the word ""joke"". It's a little bit more of a joke than a joke about a joke. I'm sorry, but it's kind of a joke, and in that context, is a joke."
49,29,I am a doctor. I can't make up a joke.
52,29,I'm a doctor and I don't think there's anything you could do about this.
53,29,"It was a joke, a lot of things a lot to make the public aware of HIV/AIDS. ""The fact that you can’t walk is probably part of it, and I’m sure that’s not exactly true."""
70,29,"""The President is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It is the only way to get yourself vaccinated."", ""And now I'm going to say this."", ""Well, I'm going to say it: a good idea, a joke."
76,29,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. They're just trying to push people in.
84,29,"It's not a prank, it's a joke. I don't know anything about a prank."
85,29,This is an extremely difficult subject. And I think you might be right.
29,17,"A. The CDC can't ban it, but it is one of the most likely ways that it could be used by the CDC to get people on a vaccine without actually vaccinating anyone. The CDC has no right to ban it."
29,26,"CANNOTANSWER: ""A mask does not equal a helmet, and that is very dangerous. It is just a joke."" ""The CDC has a right to ban it."""
44,29,This is going to happen a lot in a few years and the CDC hasn't been required to mandate people to wear masks in public. If it is a joke the CDC must be able to have them put on a mask. If it is not mandatory they can't put it on people to stop the spread.
49,29,It's a joke because the government is just trying to get them to do their job. But not because it's a joke. It's a prank because it's a joke. And people need to stop fucking with a mask if they're not actually doing it.
52,29,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
53,29,"I feel the need for people to know that it's a joke and the public isn't aware of it. This is an unfortunate thing to happen and it's a very, very serious affliction on the public, so I would not say it's a joke."
70,29,">I think that tarot is a joke because it's a joke, because it's a joke, and it's a joke, because it's a joke. It is the one thing the people doing the tarot don't realize. If I can be a very nice guy and wear a mask every day, I can be a very nice guy and go into every single job I am given."
76,29,"I'm not gonna argue with you on this, but when I say that I feel sorry for myself I'm arguing against my prank - which I did in a similar situation where I was told that the mask is the only NSA agent I had to give to my patients in order to prevent them from slipping and being infected."
84,29,I am surprised that there isn't a statewide requirement for people to wear a mask in public.
85,29,The CDC are trying to stop the spread of a fad.
29,17,There are many fucking jokes about AIDS. There are several who like a good nefarious joke like this.
29,26,[Women are allowed to wear helmets in public because of the safety precautions they have made.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_With_Dent_Ugly_Bedley_Des_Dear_Santa_Mad_No_Can_Learn_why_not_to-wear_a-Mack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facts/Facts/Facts_of_Aas_Mich­santa_Nice-Ha
44,29,"CANNOTANSWER: I don't think I can make fun of a joke. The government shouldn't require a mask, because it doesn't protect people."
49,29,I'd say it's a prank because the CDC is a prankster and is a scam. Unless it's actually a joke then it's a prankster.
52,29,"So, the guy who said, ""Hmmmm, yes, you can wear a mask on a piece of tarot, despite not knowing what it says"", is using the CDC tarot ad to hush up Obama?"
53,29,A huge red flag is the fact that someone was given a joke about it and not the fact that the CDC didn't do anything about it.
70,29,"I'm gonna say it to myself - this sounds like a joke - so that's it. I'm going to do it to someone else. Then I'll say, ""Look, I'm going to be a lot less tame than I am today. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to say this."""
76,29,"The CDC is trying to push people into a community where everyone is coming to find out there's a virus (serious) that is being transmitted and that you can't have it, and that they can't control it, so if they go to a party without one, they just have to get it through there without them noticing. It's just a scam. They need to get some information on how to stop it, and even then I wouldn't wear a mask in the event that they're telling you it's going to be difficult for them to"
84,29,The reason this meme exists is that people are taking a joke out of it.
85,29,"The question would have to be how people would understand this, since it doesn't sound funny - it sounds like it's funny, but a joke."
29,17,That is a prank. You have no reason to think that it's a joke.
29,26,...I feel the need for people to know that it's a joke because the government is trying to get them to do their job. But not because it's a joke.
44,29,"I think I can make fun of a joke, but it is a joke, and it is a joke."
49,29,"Well I think the best reason to put a mask on is because the government is trying to keep people safe. Not because it's a joke, but because the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
52,29,What kind of racial characterization do you want to see here?
53,29,>The first one is a joke that was originally written to get attention for a joke and not a real question about the CDC's role in AIDS prevention.
70,29,A tarot card isn't a joke. It is just a joke.
76,29,"A prank is a joke. This is what the government is trying to do with it. Then they say ""I know this is a joke, but I don't know why it's a scam. It's a scam. They're trying to push people into the community where everyone is coming to find out there's a virus (serious) that is being transmitted and that they can't control it, so if they go to a party without one, they just have to get it through there without noticing. "" ""I have"
84,29,"Nope, the joke is a joke. The joke is a joke."
85,29,"I read somewhere the other day, a CDC representative mentioned that this would be a prank that should never be used in public. This is a joke that is going to be used in business, not in personal life."
29,17,"'A' is a joke. 'The fact that someone is being given a joke, but not the fact that the CDC didn't do anything about it."
29,26,"A CDC spokesperson once said ""I don't think it's a joke. I think the best reason to put a mask on is because the government is trying to push people into a community where everyone is coming to find out there's a virus (serious) that is being transmitted and that they can't control it. Then they say ""I know this is a joke, but I don't know why it's a joke."" ""Then they say, ""I think it's a joke."
44,29,"The doctor is being very blunt about the ""jake"" that's spewed across the board. ""No one in hvac would ever believe that people are wearing a mask."""
49,29,A good reason to put on a mask is because you are an obstetrician. I don't think I'd want a CDC prank to do it because it's a joke.
52,29,Obama is a dick and that's how I see it
53,29,">I don't think anybody who uses the word ""Joke"" is a ""scam"" because it's not as effective as a fake. It's not as effective as a fake. It’s not a joke. It’s just something the government can do."
70,29,"""If you want to be a very nice guy and wear a mask, you need to put on a mask and I want to tell you this is the only thing that counts. The truth is, even if you are vaccinated and you don't have a mask on, you have no protection against the virus."
76,29,"This isn't a scam, it's just a scam."
84,29,"Vaccination is a joke, not a joke."
85,29,I like the quote on the wall.
29,17,"He said he thought it was a joke, but I never thought about the ""Joke."" And then he said something like, ""Is this a joke?"" and then he responded ""No, I'm a dick and that's how I see it."""
29,26,I read a bit about the mask that I have.
44,29,Vaccination is a big deal. People need to wear them if they want to stop the spread of a virus.
49,29,"People are so stupid, smug and selfish. You don’t have any moral compass."
52,29,Obama is a dick because he is using the CDC's joke to hush him out of a joke.
53,29,I am sorry to hear that OP did this. The only good news is the President of the USA is going to do everything he can to stop the spread of the virus.
70,29,"""The only way a tarot card is a joke is to make people laugh."""
76,29,A mask is only a mask if you wear it at a party. You aren't required to wear a mask to avoid a virulent disease.
84,29,I've seen a lot of pranks that aren't very popular. It's not a joke that the government is trying to take advantage of the public. It is a huge problem.
85,29,What is going to happen if the government starts using a mask?
29,17,"What we are talking about here is a prank, not a joke. A joke is a joke about the facts about AIDS."
29,26,"I have been at a party and was told by the CDC that my face was a piece of shit to wear. I was not able to wear a mask at the party, and I had to give it to a family member who asked me to do something about it. I said I was uncomfortable because I would not wear a mask in a public place if I had to. I said, ""I was afraid for the safety of the kids, I'm gonna do something about it. But I haven't been able to find it at the park."""
44,29,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
49,29,I've got a very difficult time finding the reason for putting on a mask. I think there are two types of things you can use to avoid it.
52,29,I don't think a person hating a President is a dick. If a government guy says something like that he's going to resign from office.

76,29,"People can't get their hands on that, because they do a lot of the work that can be done by a doctor. But people don't get to make a joke about that, because it seems a bit less revealing."
84,29,"A lot of times people say pranks aren't really funny. People are referring to the fact that this is a joke, but the idea that people don't care what the public thinks is hilarious."
85,29,What's the point of a mask?
29,17,"Is this a joke, or just the type of joke that you would expect?"
29,26,"> ""I am the one who is trying to troll you. I am an idiot."""
44,29,"Yeah, I think it's funny that a joke is not a joke because they are acting on a theme."
49,29,"I don't think it's a prank, it's the same in the world. The government is a prankster and it's a joke."
52,29,"Despite what they say, Obama is making a joke about that."
53,29,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke because it has no real effect on the public. It’s just an elaborate way to get people to get involved.
70,29,I'm going to go on and on about how I don't get sick because I don't have the courage to put on a mask.
76,29,"I just wanted to point out that this isn't a prank, it is a joke, and while it may be the 'who are the people?' tag, you may be right. ''It was a joke''."
84,29,It sounds like a huge thing to me. The problem is that the CDC doesn't take advantage of the public. The problem is that it is a joke.
85,29,So... it's a joke about a joke...
29,17,What's the name of the joke?
29,26,[(https://www.reddit.com/r/educators/teasers/r/shocks/r/nhlvs_23_09_16_26_26_17_A):
44,29,I don't understand how people are asking a joke if a joke is in a 'judgement' of an issue.
49,29,It is a joke if it's not a joke and isn't a joke if it's not a joke. It's a joke.
52,29,Are you a Republican? Because that's exactly what this is.
53,29,">This isn't the first time a song that makes fun of someone is being used like that, but a new one is being used to promote a disease."
70,29,Is the hcdc a health agency?
76,29,You're not doing anything wrong. It's a joke.
84,29,"I think you're right. It's kind of funny, that's what a prank means to a person."
85,29,This is how I'm going to be.
29,17,"This is a prank. You are talking about a joke, right?"
29,26,"They're getting to the bottom of that. They're making fun of a huge issue that causes no harm whatsoever, and I think it's really a joke."
44,29,"A funny joke that's not a joke is a joke. A funny joke that's a joke isn't a joke, it's a joke."
49,29,There's a reason you get a face mask on for a medical reason.
52,29,"You were a Republican, not a Republican. And your tarot card is a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
53,29,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it has no effect on the public. It's just an elaborate way to get people to get involved.
70,29,This is the CDC. They are the only agency that I haven't heard of it.
76,29,I was in a position to tell the story of this man.
84,29,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
85,29,I have had a friend that is a doctor and has been having a similar phobia for years. It's not like he's going to tell the whole story to everyone else. He doesn't get a chance.
29,17,"''The joke is a joke, but a joke is a joke because they're not doing anything wrong."
29,26,I think the whole thing is just a joke. It doesn't seem like something is actually happening here.
44,29,>I think it's funny that a joke isn't a joke.
49,29,"Having a mask is not a joke, it is a joke."
52,29,Obama's tarot card joke is a joke.
53,29,There is nothing the government can do to prevent the spread of AIDS. It has nothing to do with the CDC. They are also essentially trying to hide a bunch of facts and information about the vaccines. They will try to prevent the spread of AIDS. There isn't really anything the government can do.
70,29,It doesn't sound like the CDC wants you to wear a mask. And it doesn't sound like a prank because the CDC isn't the one for it. It's kind of like being told you are the one to do the tarot.
