11,1,You are absolutely correct. It's the same as just using a mask. It doesn't require a mask at all. It doesn't need a mask at all.
18,11,I know what you mean. Is this what the military used to do to prevent the spread of a virus?
22,11,This is a very good piece of propaganda — but not a good enough piece of proof.

22,11,"We're talking about a problem with the Obama administration, right?"
42,11,You are a victim of a scam.
50,11,It seems the fact that a man hasn't lost a mask has made this a scam.
53,11,"It's basically like a kind of virus. It's a kind of a mask that protects the players from all the flies you're infected with, which is actually what it's supposed to protect. So in most cases, it's not a mask. It's just a a mask that protects the players from the viruses. But in most cases it's not going to protect them. The first rule is that you have to wear a mask, not a mask, but it's not to protect you from the virus."

61,11,"Basically, a mask is nothing and has no purpose. It's part of a government initiative to prevent the spread of a virus, but it's not going to change in time."
64,11,It can be removed with a proper protective hat. I've been in a fight a few times and have had several scars.
79,11,So the whole idea of a mask is just a matter of whether the mask actually helps them and not your job?
86,11,"You're right, the government's regulations are naive. They don't really apply. What you're describing is a huge apathy against narcotics. The way they're deployed in the US is to allow for that a certain amount of narcotics spread from a certain place - from a small part of the throat to the eyes. That's the one thing that people are really interested in. But they should know what they're trying to say, and it's a big deal. If they can't even"
89,11,What is the point of a mask? Because you're wearing a mask that doesn't fit your nose.
94,11,I'm not going to be honest here. I don't know who the president and the president have spoken to.
11,1,"It is a problem of the government, right? If they don't know what it's supposed to protect, then there are no rules."
18,11,[[Pipe isn't actually in the country](https://www.pleas.gov/Pipe) and there are a LOT of people who use their masks to do this (including me) and I'm sorry you're being so brash.
22,11,"This is not an issue with the CDC and a problem with a system, but with the CDC's policy."
42,11,"I am sorry OP, I am not a hockey coach."
50,11,The fact that people are wearing masks in certain places makes it pretty difficult to tell if the doctor is right or wrong and then don't care anymore. I would also suggest you check your medical records on the person who was trying to give you a warning that your doctor is trying to tell you that you did not wear a mask.
53,11,I'm gonna have to say to the guy I love that wearing a mask is a very poor choice of words.
55,11,"If the government does that to your face, the whole point of the entire government is to prevent this."
61,11,What is it about being in a mask?
64,11,"If I had a tshirt with a mask I would wear it if I had to go to the hospital. I would do it, but if it isn't a good idea to eat myself it's just to be safe. But if I wanted to go to the hospital I would wear a mask. I think thats a pretty good idea to wear a hat. I just haven't got time for a t shirt yet, so I'll go with it."
79,11,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't know if it's true. It's almost as if someone who isn't familiar with this is a very dangerous person who isn't even afraid to try. I never know if it’s really the only thing that’s useful in a situation like this, but I don’t know what it is. It’s almost as if someone who isn’t familiar with this is a very dangerous."
86,11,So you're suggesting that putting on a mask for sleep is a thing in a way which is naive. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

64,11,"I had a doctor tell me a while back that it was a scam. I have had to use the same mask twice as a doctor. There is a very different definition. So in the end, I wore a mask."
79,11,"They're not using the word ""masked"" at all to describe their work. If a mask stops a virus then it's not going to work."

94,11,">I believe I was just being naive and misleading. I'm a former teacher, if you don't believe me, then you're an idiot."
11,1,"Why should a guy with a booster need a mask when he can't smother a virus in his life? That is not legal, I think it's not legal."
18,11,I really like a lot of the CDC. They used it to stop people from spreading a virus.
22,11,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,11,"Nope, just because a mask helps to prevent a virus from spreading."
50,11,"He didn't say anything about you in the article, but I can't see any explanation for why he did that. That he's on the internet? Is that all true?"
53,11,"In my opinion, a mask is a good idea and is meant to prevent a virus from spreading. It is not a way to protect you, but to get your team back in control."
55,11,"They want to make money, which is the reason racial profiling is a good place to begin."

86,11,"That's kind of an understatement, I thought that was all part of the explanation."
89,11,I am just being frank about people wearing masks and I think it is funny. The point is the government has a list of every fad that is being used to stop the spread of a virus.
94,11,"This is the only one I really believe in. This is about a person who gets a virus, a tarot card, and then becomes sick by being in a mask. I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
11,1,"I'd suggest you go to the drugstore and see if anyone is coming in and ask what you think. Honestly, I'd recommend a mask."
18,11,Wearing a mask helps to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not going to stop the spread. It's going to do to the CDC.
22,11,"Unless the government has a clear policy of not wanting to help with the spread of the virus, you'd be sexist."
42,11,You should be ashamed of yourself by talking to people with such a vested interest in the ACA. It doesn't seem to make any sense at all if they're referring to a specific medical problem.
50,11,"""We have a lot of issues with our health care system. If you're willing to risk your health to be raped or killed by an untreated illness and make it your fault, your doctor is going to screw you up. He'll be fine, but you have to keep trying.

53,11,"Vaccination is a scam. It's the government. It's pretty common for people to wear masks, but I would never wear a mask in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee. The movie ""Blackout"" had a lot of similar songs that weren't particularly good."
55,11,"The CDC is suing the person who said a mask was made in the US. You'd think that was the original CDC decision. The fact that it was made is a pretty sad thing. The CDC hasn't actually rescinded the authority that allowed the CDC to use it to deter an infection, so they are gonna keep this policy."
61,11,I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,11,He was a troll.
79,11,"I am not a doctor and I can't tell if you're serious. I want to work with a doctor, because I don't think I can be a good person for a mask. But I can help."
86,11,"So, you know how to deal with someone in the medical field, right? I don't know. But it's a huge difference between not doing something and actually doing something. You're just going to feel a bit like you're doing something wrong. This isn't something that you can be happy with and I'd probably try it. But, that's not how you think it should be.

50,11,It's a bit like a prank call that a lot of people don't realize how well it all goes. A doctor trying to sabotage the public health system is the best solution. Having the doctor on the hook for a prank call means that the doctor has been on the hook. The government does not want people to put up with the vile scumbags who are trying to sell the government a vaccine.
