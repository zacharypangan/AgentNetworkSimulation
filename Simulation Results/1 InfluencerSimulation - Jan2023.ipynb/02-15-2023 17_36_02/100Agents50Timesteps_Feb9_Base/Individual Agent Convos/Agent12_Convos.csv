82,12,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
12,4,I am sorry but i have to say that the first thing that come to my mind is the rebuke from the government. It makes me feel bad a little when they don't stop the spread of viruses by educating people in ways to make them feel better about the situation.
12,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
15,12,I would suggest contacting the FSU football team and ask them to show you the rules.
21,12,"I have a friend who just lost a friend to a covid, and they have a phobia about them."
22,12,">Affordable to the states and a lot of states, I'm a health care worker, and i need a life if i fly for the first time"
32,12,"i don't think the national healthcare system will work unless they can get people to wear a mask and you have to wear a mask, even if you're not vaccinated and in the military."

12,6,I just wanted to say that I would be very upset with my neighbor for bringing a baby to the doctors because she is pregnant because it sounds like they don't realize that people have had to get them to go.
15,12,I'm an admin at the hockey olympic team. I want to play for my team. I've done a lot of dumb things. But I like the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here?
21,12,This is a big deal.
22,12,"It's important to be safe when flying. I think you don't really want to get caught up in the media coverage and the fact that you need to wear a mask for a long trip is a big reason to ignore them, and for some reason the president elicits some confusion."
32,12,I lost a mask because I thought it would put me in an unprotected environment with someone else who could spit on me.
46,12,I think the NSA should be more concerned about what they're going to get away with.
82,12,I'm not even talking about the fact that a lot of people don't like the fact that people have a hard time breathing since the vaccines came out.
12,4,It would be a lot more effective to go on a trip that is free and easy to walk on in the country.
12,6,"Well, I am not sure if they are trying to stop the spread of the virus by educating people and not by making people feel better about them. I am sure they are trying to get people to wear masks to keep people safe if they are fucking them up."
15,12,I'd be interested in hearing your reaction and the whole point of your comment.
21,12,"I know it's scary how the government feels, and they do the same thing when it comes to hating a bunch of people. I have done one of these things."
22,12,"You should go to the CDC. They are going to give you a free traveler's kit. I would go to that airport. There are a lot of people who have not even been in one since March because of AIDS, so you would need to bring along some masks and sunglasses. I would be very concerned about them being able to get over this."
32,12,i've been around this a long time so it is sort of interesting that people do not understand the 'why' that is a common misconception about the government

12,4,Do you know why there is a separate group that's not interested in bringing a child to the doctors?
12,6,I can see where you have the problem here.
15,12,"My mom's been vaccinated, she is so concerned about putting a mask on while in public and asking people to wear theirs. She didn't even want to wear it as a mask."
21,12,It’s also one of the most terrifying things we have ever seen in our lifetime.
22,12,"OP, you're in an awesome situation: [[https://www.gov.gov/news/news/emb.html](https://www.gov.gov/news/emb.html)"
32,12,"""If I have a mask on I know the nhs can make a mask. And if I do not have one I'll just wear it."""
46,12,"As a medical student, I can say it's very sarcastic and arrogant and that's why it's so funny and scary to read."
82,12,'cannot'is in the CDC's words and I agree with them.
12,4,CANNOTANSWER: Do you know why there is a separate group that's not interested in bringing a child to the doctors?
12,6,It's scary how the government feels and they do the same thing when it comes to hating a bunch of people.
15,12,"I'm getting my vaccinated in the form of a mask. I'm wearing a mask for the purpose of making my kids feel safer, I'm not wearing a mask because I'm afraid they might be infected, and I'm afraid it's not good for you."
21,12,oh... no.
22,12,So there's something wrong with a guy who wants to be a politician.
32,12,I think we'll get it back. There's no way to prove that the government isn't doing it correctly.
46,12,">As a medical student, I can say it's very sarcastic and arrogant and that's why it's so funny and scary to read."
82,12,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
12,4,"I don't know the origins of that but I am not sure if you can tell me. I'm looking at an image of a person who is being vaccinated, putting on a mask to get a child into the hospital, putting on a mask in public, and then giving them a mask in their own home. I think if they want to see you in the hospital, they want to see you in the hospital, and so they want to keep you in hospital. They want to know how to put on a mask, but then they're not"
12,6,"It sounds like your mother is bringing your baby to the doctors. They might not have realized that the virus is there, but they will."
15,12,"Unless you're an active participant or a member of a non-communicable disease, which will be in your life, this is not something to take for granted."
21,12,"You can't go out without a mask, but you can take a helmet or mask, a cuff or a collar, a harness or a vest. Despite all that, there is still a stigma that applies to people who do not have a mask."
22,12,"I think the govt. is just being dumb. Mostly a joke that 'did not stop' someone. It's not a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke. It's not like he's going to do a fucking thing, he's saying that he's 'going to do a lot of things wrong, but I'm not going to do anything wrong. 'Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination? '"
32,12,"I'm not a doctor, but I have an acclimatization and a hearing aid. My employer needs to be out of the office. I have to tell them that it is not worth it to get a nhs mask. I also know that it will cost more to buy the vaccine. I think they need to make sure that they can get you the vaccine they need. It seems like they're trying to make a false acclimatization."
46,12,">He’s in trouble, he needs to stop. It’s his job."
82,12,"It's a simple joke. What's wrong with that? It's not a joke, or a joke, it's an honest piece of shit."

21,12,"You can wear a mask unless it has a government mandate. I know there are a lot of things in this thread that I might not even know about, but hey, are there any of the things I don't need?"
22,12,"It's a joke, it's a joke."
32,12,"I feel like the question I ask is about who the victim is. Obama has a history of being a scumbag. He said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not."
46,12,"Unless you were a medical student, you didn't want to tell everyone that the government is just doing the right thing. That's not what a 'normal' doctor is talking about. If they are not, you're going to be in the wrong place. They need a lawyer."
82,12,">The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam."
12,4,I've heard of people getting vaccinated by the government. It's a big deal.
12,6,"A lot of the things I read on this sub are just not true. I read it the other day and thought ""What are you going to do when you start wearing a mask?"" I was too late. It was all kind of fun to read."
15,12,My favorite part of the movie was that my girlfriend said that she would never wear a mask when her husband asked her to. Then a friend told her that he would go out with the friends of friends of her.
21,12,"People who think that wearing a mask is a prank, but not mandated, are sarcastic, but they are a joke."
22,12,"I'm a man of faith who has a job if I wear a mask, a government employee, a medical professional, or someone who's actually sick and wants to get over AIDS."
32,12,"It's like saying ""you can't tell them it's wrong to wear a mask,"" but your dick isn't right to tell them. It's just an expression on the person who said it's wrong."
46,12,"As a medical student, I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. I can't remember if it was any good."
82,12,The CDC is making sweeping public declaration that it is scam. I think the problem is with the fact that the government is acting like a devil.
12,4,"> As a medical student, I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents."
12,6,I think that we have to keep the CDC in the picture when we get a medical student to wear a mask in school.
15,12,"I would have to go out with my family if my mom stayed with them when we went hockey. But if you ask me, this guy gets a lot of pranks in the comments. And, as you all said, this is not about the government, this is about the CDC. It's about the CDC being a devil, not the people who want to prevent the spread of a virus."
21,12,"CANNOTANSWER - ""I think you're going to get upset. I think you're going to have a hard time taking a seat for 10 minutes because you put on a mask and then take it off when you get to your table."""
22,12,"That’s not exactly a joke, just a joke that says that it's important to be safe when flying."
32,12,It's just that they are trying to hide something in this thread that was supposed to be interesting.
46,12,"I'm not even gonna lie, I haven't seen a hat on my mother in months."
82,12,The problem is with the fact that the government is acting like a devil.
12,4,"So, is your name a joke?"
12,6,>I think that we have to keep the CDC in the picture when we get a medical student to wear a mask in school.
15,12,"No shit, he's not a racist. You should have a job to weed out anyone who has a problem with the CDC."
21,12,CANNOTANSWER: the word sarcastically is scary and I've interpreted it 'right' to start.
22,12,The CDC is also promoting AIDS prevention and testing. They are in contact with millions of people who have AIDS if they think they need to be vaccinated and they have some information that can help them stop this.
32,12,"The mask of a twitchcon joke is a prank, and I'd suggest it."
46,12,[[(http://dp.nba.gov/pubs/pdsp/nba_info/historia_event_i_department_of_health/)](http://www.sci.gov/conspiracy/Sci-govt-security/sci-govt-security/pdf).
82,12,I think that's one of the main reasons why people do what they do.
12,4,"I'm a doctor, and I'm not going to try to be a prankster. I am not going to be a doctor."
12,6,"I'm not surprised this guy got a lot of comments like this, but I just find it hard to believe he even has a job doing that thing."
15,12,Are you sure there isn't more people in this thread than A-ha! fan?
21,12,"Aside from putting on a mask to get past the rat, it might just work."
22,12,"A joke, I'm not sure, but I'd say a joke. You're not a man of faith, you're a guy of faith."
32,12,That's not a scam. It's the kind of joke I would do to a patient who has to come and have someone come to their rescue. It sounds like they may be attempting to spread the word of a scam.
46,12,"The president wears a mask when he's not wearing it, and if it gets stung in his face or something, it's not a problem."
82,12,The tarot is a good thing.
12,4,"I think that's one of the main reasons why people do what they do. The CDC is also promoting AIDS prevention and testing. They are in contact with millions of people who have AIDS if they think they need to be vaccinated and they have some information that can help them stop this.

12,6,It is probably not a scam to try to bring the word sarcastically to the front page.
15,12,">[I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a racist. Why is that being a joke?"
21,12,There is a difference between sarcasm and twilight.
22,12,I think the guy's going to think that he's a racist and obnoxious and will be able to use his own money to buy a hive brain.
32,12,"I've had the opportunity to make jokes on people in the past with the president. He seemed like a scumbag. He said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not. Obama has said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not. Obama has said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not."
46,12,My friends say that the hat is not a hat. It's a hat.
82,12,I really don't understand why people wear masks at parties?
12,4,"I don't know why you are so concerned. I've come across more of these people on reddit than in the first two years, and it's really irking me, but I'm not sure why you're so concerned."
12,6,"People will always buy masks, but they can't buy a hive brain."
15,12,"If he's actually not racist, then there is no reason to believe he's being a racist."
21,12,The CDC is the first government agency to mandate sarcasm. It's a prank. But it's a joke.
22,12,I don't know what the heck you just said. I was a medical student in school and I can't imagine being in the public eye if it was me.
32,12,I grew up with a sex therapist who made a pretty big deal of how I was treated. I was told that I didn't have a mask because it was a mask and was in the hospital and I wasn't allowed to get sick. I found a mask and a hearing aid and the doctor was very supportive and helped me.
46,12,I think the hat is a joke? Is it a mask? Because a mask is not a mask.
82,12,"A person is a person, not a religion. You're not a religious person. You are a religious person."
12,4,I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It seems like the CDC is the first government agency to mandate sarcasm. It's a prank. But it's a joke.

21,12,"I don't know. I am going to say a different thing, I've never used a cdc clone."
22,12,They're trying to make a joke because they feel the government is being obnoxious.

46,12,"CANNOTANSWER: The President and his friends are talking about the issue of AIDS. It sounds like a joke, but it's just a way to make a joke, and it's no joke. It is a new idea."

12,6,That is a great point.
15,12,I would like to ask if there are any issues with his tarot card.
21,12,"It's really sad that some of this isn't being questioned and you can't think of a single sentence that can be addressed in a different way, and that's the same reason why it's so important to get out of the hospital and get to the doctors."
22,12,"A ""Hive Mind"" is a mask that is inserted in your mouth to help suck the virus. It's used in public health. They can't get over it. Mostly, the medical profession is used for that and is a function of that."
32,12,I’d take it if I didn’t get the vaccine.
46,12,"This is a joke, and it is an excellent point. But the CIA has been trying to stop AIDS from spreading themselves, and to make sure this is done, a good thing."
82,12,I can't imagine how much fun that would be if this were a tarot card. What's it about?
12,4,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't know what the heck you just said.

32,12,"I’m a doctor, and my husband has AIDS and he’s got a lot of shit to do, so I’ve been putting on a mask and I’ve never been able to make any money off it. He’s a cynical douchebag. And he’s lying to me about it, saying he’s vaccinated, and he’s not."
46,12,The CDC is using this to keep people from getting AIDS. This 'hat'is a joke.
82,12,So the only person who cares is the government? That's the tarot card.
12,4,You can not tell the truth about a tarot card. It is only a joke.
12,6,>I'm not sure if they are trying to stop the spread of the virus by educating people and not by making people feel better about them. I am sure they are trying to get people to wear masks to keep people safe if they are fucking them up.
15,12,I'm assuming the president has no idea what the joke is.
21,12,I don't know if trolls are a scamming group. They're petty trolls.
22,12,I'd like to point out that some of those jokes were actually written by a politician who was also a medical student.
32,12,I had to shave a lot. AIDS is a virus that causes my hair to get really dry.

21,12,"That is all very well written. It has a lot of very good points, and a lot of good points and information."
22,12,There is a problem with the government trying to make up jokes with other people.

21,12,*I'm not sure why it makes you think this is a joke. Not a lawyer. I would probably get a lawyer and ask him if the CDC would be able to do it. The CDC doesn't require anyone to wear a mask in public unless they have a health insurance coverage.
22,12,He's right about all this.

32,12,It is a joke and it is a joke.
46,12,It seems to me that the CDC's trying to prevent AIDS spread isn't a joke.

46,12,"You say that you see some funny things in the hat, but do you really think it’s funny? 'Poorn' is really just a joke."
