I'm not saying Obama should have anything to do with it, but it is a very obnoxious thing to do. You know, the person who started a new program, and who just didn't agree to the idea of giving children the chance to vote."
28,8,Why don't you just wear a mask and try to convince people to not wear a mask?

70,8,"As a non-athlete, I can say with certainty that the way this video is playing is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life.

27,8,"I'm pretty sure it's not racist. But there's no reason to get in the hospital without a mask, or have a booster."
28,8,"Yes, the first time the government asked someone to wear a mask, they did so to convince people to stop the spread of the virus. Honestly, I'm not sure why a government snooping is possible to be a criminal. It's just another way to talk to your boss and get them to not wear a mask unless there's a problem."
35,8,I'm not a lawyer.

86,8,"I don't think i should go to an r/advice forum. I could just buy a mask, or at least a decent one. Or in a more general sense to be wearing one. I mean, what else would they do for me?"
87,8,"The problem is that you need to talk to your state congressperson who voted to enact the government's ""mask protection"" legislation. There's a reason it's so hard to get people to take the health care legislation that's actually a good idea."
98,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

36,8,"So, this is a really good video...?"
47,8,"Isn't it a joke about the government and people who are against vaccines? If so, why not keep the masks? I don't think anyone on Reddit understands how the government's stance on this is a big deal."
49,8,There are a lot of people who get sick when they don't have a mask.
52,8,"> I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want' to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want' to wear a mask to protect my children'. I like how the person who has to wear a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people. It's not a nutjob but a fake joke."
53,8,No. I don't like to do any other things. I can't understand why this wouldn't happen if you didn't get a slap on the wrist and wore it. That's really the only thing in that situation that would happen to you if you did not wear a mask.
70,8,"As a non-athlete, I can say with certainty that the way this video is playing is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life."
74,8,"I'm sorry but I'm not a hockey coach. I love hockey players with my own hair, my dang hair, and my shirt. I'm a great guy, but my husband hates his hat. I think you need to understand what a mask is. A good one is a helmet."
80,8,I'm an American male and I am trying to have a positive view on Obama's policies.
81,8,"I have a lot of friends who are genuinely terrible at this game, and it is really hard for them to keep up with the state of their career in the same manner they've been with their friends in years."
86,8,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,8,Why do you think the people in question have been in a position to talk to someone about the health care legislation?
98,8,"The only thing I remember from this movie is that it was a long list of jokes. I actually like wearing masks, so I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. I can't remember if it was any good."
27,8,I think the first step of a rename of the government is to call the administration a bad one.
28,8,"Why would I wear a mask in the first place, while in the medical field?"
35,8,I didn't say it's anything but bad.

49,8,"I think we need to move. Because it's a big issue. We need to get over our fear of the government, not our own."
52,8,"A mask is a joke, you read that as a joke and you say it's not a joke. A mask is a joke. I do not like a joke, but it's a joke."
53,8,What about the fact that the US government doesn't have a good history of providing protective gear to players?
70,8,"He was trying to make sure the public knew about the ""no duty to protect people who aren't vaccinated"" part. Then he was trying to make sure everyone knew this part, which was all of a sudden outright false."
74,8,They use the anti-virus prank as a means to stop a virus.
80,8,"It's a good idea to bring a big red flag. In the United States, there's a lot of blatant government interference."
81,8,The only people with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends.
86,8,"This whole whole whole thing is a joke. I'm not even sure if this is the truth, but they are absolutely fucking ignorant."
87,8,Are they not the victims of HIV?
98,8,"I haven't read any of these, but I'm sure the information I'm getting from reading is quite useful."
27,8,It seems you don't have a big opinion here.
28,8,"Well, it's an incredibly dangerous job. But it's not a problem in the public eye. It's an excellent way to protect your employer from your employers."
35,8,"If I had to choose between a mask and a shirt, I'd go with a hat. The hat, the hat. I think it's important to understand what it is."

47,8,"That is a good idea, yes? A good idea!"
49,8,"> The issue I'm referring to here is that I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on at all. ""I don't care for the I don't"" word."
52,8,The joke is a lot more about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's a good idea.
53,8,'The best part about hockey is you can't play with a mask unless you are physically fit. But what about those pranks and rumors of the virus? Thats a good point.
70,8,I’m going to get my life back on track. I’m also going to keep putting on a mask for a week or two in case of a big problem. I want to snoop for days and months. I also need to wear a vaccinated mask for work.
74,8,"This seems to be the real answer. There are lots of other pranks, pranks, pranks, etc. People have very different definitions of masks and masks. Some say this is really useful for protecting people, a lot of them are a joke, but a mask is enough to do anything, and they do a great job of showing that."
80,8,"In the US, they use the “weaker med” to control the government. I don’t know about CDC but you need to tell your doctor that the government is doing these kinds of things."
81,8,The afghans can get away with this. I'm the fucking masked gangster.
86,8,"The whole thing is a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
87,8,"He's an official in his own right, it doesn't hurt to think he is."
98,8,Heh. I'd say the trick is not to 'get on a mask'. The trick is to look around and see what's going on.
27,8,"""Oh no, I have never heard of sex for a living, especially in my city. I know you don't want to talk about it, but you are not an adult. I'm going to start talking about the sex for a living. Is it OK to be a gay man in the United States? I'm not sure about that at all,"" a person on the internet who doesn't have any sense of humor, and I'm not sure whether or not I should be a homosexual man. I'm not aware what it's about it"
28,8,I have been raped a lot by a tarot card before - this isn't a scam but a scam.

49,8,"In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus, and are worn on an everyday basis. Is it not a scam because it seems like a scam?"
52,8,It's an AIDS scam.
53,8,>It's ok not to wear a mask. It's okay to wear it under a helmet. It's just a mask.
70,8,"Are you referring to the fact that the government has no responsibility to protect people from a virus? Vaccination in the US, if used correctly, is considered a medical malpractice. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."
74,8,This is where this comes from.
80,8,They’re trying to swindle the public into thinking they’re a great deal worse off than they have been.
81,8,What's the point of not wearing a mask in office?
86,8,"It's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
87,8,"He sounds very friendly to me, because I don't know if I've ever heard him say that it's ok not to wear a mask because it's against my rights, and it seems like his right to do it is on the AIDS government."
98,8,Is it because I’m in the twilight era? I haven’t been there but I can do more than 10 minutes of walking through a restaraunt in a couple of hours.
27,8,The Obama administration doesn't seem to be concerned with the safety of the public.
28,8,">I’m really sorry that you were unable to reach out to me. I have been raped a lot by a tarot card, and it didn’t say anything about a tarot card."
35,8,I have a friend who is a doctor and has used her mask to make fun of the guy when he did that.
36,8,It's a scam.
47,8,It's a joke.
49,8,"And I'd say ""the government is trying to change the shit out of us here."
52,8,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
53,8,"Vaccination is the best part of the sport, despite what most of the commentators suggest. A good thing if the government is responsible, then it can help prevent AIDS epidemics by providing masks to players, especially since you're a healthy person in the US."
70,8,">The NSA mandates that people don't wear masks when they have no intention of getting sick, that they don't want their health to suffer. It is the only way to get yourself vaccinated.

74,8,I'm a hockey coach. My hockey coach did a prank on my players.
80,8,"It isn't a scam, it's a scam. The president is helping the US government to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is wrong."
81,8,"In the US, when you get an unattended sick in the name of your profession, you do not have to wear a mask to prevent your husband from getting sick."
86,8,">The whole thing is a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke."
87,8,"Nope, not really tarot cards. They're tarot cards and not actually tarot cards."
98,8,I'm not the type of person who would put on a mask when I need a good nap or take a nap...
27,8,...the CDC [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
28,8,This is why you wear a mask to avoid a mask being worn in a party.
35,8,The joke has already been put into r/sillyfaces.
36,8,"Vaccination is not always a good thing, but it's something that's not a thing for everyone, not just the CDC."
47,8,I feel like this is the kind of joke that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
49,8,"I don't know what'milk' means - I've been in the military since I was 5... I know it's not illegal, but I think it's a scam."
52,8,Obama is a racist. He is a racist. He is a racist.
53,8,">You're going to need to talk to a nhlvs head coach who can't work out the problems that come with wearing a mask."""
70,8,"The point is, when the government is trying to keep people safe, it shouldn't be able to prevent that from happening. I know it seems arbitrary but the broader idea is it’s part of the laws that control whether you are a victim, or infected, because of how they've treated you. AIDS is a cult of the tarot. It has become a cult of the tarot. So I'm not an expert on the virus, but I do wear a mask every day."
74,8,"This isn’t about a prank, it’s about a troll hat."
80,8,"I don't understand why the president doesn't get that - the only reason the president's scumbag has been involved is because the CDC isn't giving the vaccine and so much as trying to influence his policies (although they have been doing it for awhile now, the Obama administration is a bit off now)."
81,8,I think it's a shame they don't seem to think about the issue.
86,8,"The word ""jam"" doesn't even get thrown out. They are not funny because they are not going to make a joke. It gets thrown out because they are putting a shit in your face and trying to get people in the game. It's just that the joke doesn't get to be in a real way."
87,8,"He's a troll, and the government is trying to make him look like a troll."
98,8,I can see why you have some problems with people wearing masks. Having a mask for a couple of hours before you snooze and taking a nap is so much better than just getting into a cab..
27,8,"I like your username - if I want to have a funny joke about you, you've got to have a joke about the government."
28,8,"Vaccinations work in a different way, and they are a way of protecting the public, not in a way that has a lot of implication for people."
35,8,"The CDC is a prick, and they have a lot of it. You may not like them if you don't abide by the CDC's mandate but what's going on if you're the one who is making fun of this guy?"
36,8,>I've seen several jokes about the government getting an idea of the virus on their people. I've written a number of books devoted to AIDS
47,8,>I feel like this is the kind of joke that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
49,8,>I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on.
52,8,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
53,8,"I've seen the CDC spewed masks on a few people, too, and there is definitely a problem with it. If a guy has a mask on his head that hasn't been properly covered, then there is a problem. If you guys don't, the team is on their game and they won't make a mistake, so they can do something to prevent the problem."
70,8,I don't know if you could tell the difference between wearing a mask and the CDC's mandate:
74,8,"I've got to say, 'A lot of sports coaches don't wear a mask anymore.'"
80,8,I can't believe I've never seen a racist ad that's all over the place.
81,8,"As a former football coach, I'm sure we're all getting more and more confused."
86,8,"You aren't trying to be funny, it is a joke. You don't understand. It's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke. You're not trying to be funny, it's a joke."
87,8,"The tarot cards are tarot cards, not tarot cards."
98,8,I think you should read this. The 'twilight era' is a great movie. It's pretty funny - it's just as much about a film as it is about a film. You are the first person to read the book.
27,8,The government is the one who is the bad choice for the Republican party.
28,8,"I think a lot of people want to get a sick tom. I'm sure they have a feeling that something is off, but it's a scam to me."
35,8,"A joke, not a joke. That's all."
36,8,"So, in a way, I'm joking? A false tarot card is a tarot deck that says that if a tarot card is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
47,8,I am a Canadian with a friend who works in a pharmacy. I smoked weed for over two weeks. The last time I smoked weed with him for over two weeks. The last time he showed up on my visit I had a scar on my nose that was going to go right across my face a couple days later. I never recovered from the infection.
49,8,">I don't like that kind of thing. I want to get away from it, so if I can't figure out how to, I need to just cut myself. People wearing masks are doing so much better in America than they should be in the US. They're not even allowed to get tested for HIV because it's a serious disease, and they're not allowed to prevent someone from getting it. That's one of the most misguided and misguided ways to do this."
52,8,I think a lot of people in the comments are saying that the US government has become a cult of the tarot.
53,8,"I was not a coach, but I didn't make a complaint to the CDC. I thought that if people are not vaccinated for AIDS, they should get vaccinated."
70,8,The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick.
74,8,I'd say this is something that the coach should know about. A hockey mask is just a way to make a joke.
80,8,"I'm sure that the government is trying to make people feel bad about Obama's policies and I’m sure it is doing a good job of making them feel bad, but the CDC is still using their own money to do it. This is a terrible idea that would never happen, not even if the CDC wasn't helping the cause."
81,8,They can't do that.
86,8,I don't understand why he's asking for jokes and saying that he won't be doing them or even trying to bring them up but the fact that the government is trying to make a joke for the sake of a good person.
87,8,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,8,"I think it's kind of funny, but then I don't know what's going on because I've listened to this thread a ton and it makes me feel guilty, and I don't want to give up on myself."
27,8,>This is a great example of a big issue on the national level.

52,8,This is how you describe AIDS.
53,8,He said the CDC had a mandate to put on the masks and the AIDS epidemic was not a prank.
70,8,"He referred to a different point a lot of times in his criticisms, as the CDC's mandates that people shouldn't wear a mask are a skewed symbiotic relationship with the CDC, which it sounds like."

86,8,I'm not sure what the joke is. I just think it's a joke. It doesn't mean it's a joke. 'Just because the government is trying to push people in doesn't mean it's a joke'.
87,8,>A lot of people can't be cured from HIV/AIDS. He was a sick rabid teen that wasn't wearing a mask. Is the AIDS epidemic a cult of the tarot?

86,8,There's no way to tell if the government is trying to push people in or not. It's just a joke. It's a joke.

35,8,There's a very short line that says 'I don't think this is a joke at all' and then it goes something like 'I'm going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus'
36,8,This is the only explanation I can give you for this. Is it possible that the tarot card was used by the CDC to prevent HIV transmission in America? Is it possible that they were able to do something to prevent HIV transmission? Is it possible that the CDC is actively trying to discourage people from doing something for HIV prevention?

28,8,I feel like the answer is the best. The government is actually using masks to prevent people from getting AIDS.
35,8,I don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Maybe you should see a doctor that has a background in health care or someone who is a doctor if you like tarot cards. Then go find a doctor who has a background in health care and a great background in health care.
36,8,I'm not sure that's what you're looking for.
47,8,"That's why I have the masks. I feel like they're not for the whole government, because unless I'm in a doctor's office I'm going to get sick and have the virus.

35,8,It's a joke because the government doesn't do anything about it and doesn't care about the people involved.

49,8,I think this is a little too much of an attempt to avoid getting in trouble.
52,8,"You mean ""Obama is not a racist. He is a racist."""
53,8,Then why don't you just have a shirt and go play?
70,8,">In the tarot card world, people are just looking for a way to keep themselves safe."
74,8,So you have to be sure to be sure that you know what you are talking about? I think you do.
80,8,"The CDC are attempting to sabotage my life by getting my health care insurance, granting me a full refund, not just to get my house clean and make me feel good, but to make me feel like a scumbag who is trying to make the public feel bad because they cannot pay my medical bills or support me, and to make my own life miserable."
81,8,"I'm not a doctor, but a guy who got AIDS in the last 10 years was a prankster. If a prankster was a dick, he would be a big fan."

27,8,It sounds like you have a tarot card in your brain. I'd probably say 'I'm a fucking troll' but that isn't the correct answer. It's the same memes with the same thing over and over.

47,8,I think the CDC is trying to make the public aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This isn't a joke. It's a joke because the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They want to stop the spread of AIDS.
49,8,"Vaccination is a joke - I think it is a joke and it is a joke - but unless you're trying to make a joke, it isn't a joke."
52,8,"I know, right? I'm getting a little philosophical. I've got a feeling that's what's going on here."
53,8,"It's a joke, it's the joke. It's not a joke, it's just a joke. The CDC is not preventing AIDS. They can't prescribe a vaccine. They can't use it to prevent other diseases.

He doesn't understand why a hockey coach would wear a mask, and he isn't aware of how he looks.

27,8,I thought there was a way to make jokes about the government without having to wear a mask? You're an idiot.
28,8,"It is a scam to be asked not to wear a mask when you're not in the medical field, but to have a mask to prevent people from getting sick."
35,8,A fucking prank. It is a joke. They have a lot of jokes and a lot of a narcissists who are trying to create a joke to hide their stories. Vaccination isn't a prank because people get sick and they want to prevent it. It's a joke because they want to make fun of the people who're making fun of it.
36,8,It's also possible that the person is an agressive rapist and the person harmed is a fugitive.
47,8,"I am actually a doctor and I've been to TWitchCon, a really interesting forum."
49,8,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a scam. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke and it's a joke."
52,8,"Well, if they're doing anything to stop the spread of the virus they should probably stop promoting them because it carries a significant risk of infection."
53,8,Vaccination is not a joke.
70,8,You're not putting on a mask for 2 years. You're wearing a mask for 3 weeks. It's a good idea.
74,8,"I just want to add some more, but I don't see that much of a difference between this and a joke. I think it's a joke, which the president is doing to prevent the spread of AIDS, as in a mask that prevents people from getting AIDS vaccinations."

28,8,I would be worried about having a doctor in your office if it was an actual tarot card.

53,8,I think this is a bit over the top for this sub. I don't want to get sucked in by the current CDC because of all the stuff they've just written in this sub... I think that's it.
70,8,It sounds like the president is a prankster.
74,8,I think this is a great example of a prank. I think the president has to wear a mask as part of a deal with CDC to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.

36,8,CANNOTANSWER: I've seen several jokes about the government trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
47,8,We do it for fun. But what we get for being uncomfortable is that there is no way the government will help to control or prevent HIV/AIDS.
49,8,"In the US, a person wearing a mask to prevent people with AIDS can be prosecuted for it."
52,8,What's the joke? No!
53,8,"They didn't say shit about AIDS. They said it was a prank. They don't use it to prevent other diseases. The article says the CDC can use it to prevent AIDS, but it's a joke."

28,8,"It's not a joke, it's a prank. It's a joke."
35,8,"I just want to awk and say I don't think it's funny either because I don't know what I think the CDC is trying to do with it. But I know what you mean. I just want to ask if there is anything wrong with the CDC that is trying to make it funny, and what is a good idea to do?"
36,8,"The CDC is investigating a number of issues with the fake cards - including the ""Meat"" prank. I'm not sure what they are trying to tell people."
47,8,"I like the whole 'Silver Tampon' joke. It's fun, and I'm not a big fan of the 'Silver Tampon' thing."
49,8,Vaccination isn't a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke because the government doesn't have a role to play.
52,8,"Obama’s new vaccination program. “This isn’t a joke, but it’s an effective method of preventing the spread of a virus.”"

87,8,Ingraham said he'd like the card in his deck if it were real. I don't like him saying he's a troll because he's a troll.
98,8,Having the idea of a mask is a joke.
27,8,"It's a joke but the government has said it isn't a joke, and he's being a troll. The issue is that this is one of the best examples of a big issue on the national level."

49,8,No. The CDC is running a lot of anti-HIV programs.
52,8,AIDS is an epidemic. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans.
53,8,I think that the joke is too stupid to be a joke. The joke is a joke to do because the joke is to make the CDC use it and not to prevent other diseases. It's a joke because it's not the right joke to use it and not the right joke to create.
70,8,"Vaccination is not a prank. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."

81,8,No - The CDC is a serious problem with scams. They have a serious problem with scams. There's no way that anyone with the mask would go to a game without some form of tarot card.

87,8,"It's interesting the difference in tarot cards is that the tarot cards are not tarot cards. It seems that if someone does a deck with a tarot, the tarot will skew their minds."
98,8,The best way to tell a joke is just saying what you think is good. Then you have a really great reason to be upset because a lot of people with mental illness are having the same problems as you.
27,8,"A lot of sexy people don't even care about the government, they know a lot more than the US's government"
28,8,The whole CDC prank thing makes sense. The actual government is snooping and not in a way that is going to protect people. The problem is that it's not a real thing to me.

49,8,"A CDC official told me that the CDC has been doing the same thing. It says that if a person gets sick for two weeks, they don't need a mask."
52,8,"Vaccination isn't a virus, it's an anti - HIV pill and you can't use that to make a joke about the problem. The government isn't trying to stop the spread of the virus and the government is attempting to make it worse."
53,8,"A CDC official is probably trying to avoid the problem, especially since they have already declared it a prank."
70,8,"Vaccination is considered a prank. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."
74,8,The question you were asking is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. The question is why it's not a joke?
80,8,It's the President who has been influencing the health care policy.
81,8,"I don't understand why the CDC is not making a prank about the AIDS epidemic, but rather that the CDC is a major public health institution that makes it very difficult for people to get an AIDS vaccine, or that the CDC has a real problem with it."

74,8,"As much as I hate this, it is a prank that I will never try to avoid, and when I do I don't realize that I can't."
80,8,It’s a big red flag. They have been working for so long that it’s impossible to get the CDC to cover it. But it’s not working for a long time. That is a big red flag.

98,8,I’ve done this all the time.
27,8,CANNOTANSWER has to agree with the other commenters that this is a great example of a big issue on the national level.
28,8,"I like that the guy is so overreacting about how they were thinking of doing something like ""I was raped by tarot cards""."
35,8,"The article cites: ""The CDC is not a prank. They have a lot of jokes and a lot of a narcissists who are trying to create a joke to hide their stories."""

47,8,"It's not a joke because it's a scam, it's a scam because they are trying to make the public aware of the epidemic, it's a joke because it's a scam because it doesn't affect the spread of HIV/AIDS."
49,8,"This is a very old problem. I've been in the military for years and I've never had to go to the hospital to get tested for AIDS but I can't recall any evidence for a tampon. I guess the most important thing is that I'm not the one that actually put it on, and the reason is that I have to make sure it's on."
52,8,The government should be doing something about the problem. It doesn't make any sense to do this. It's simply not the right way to handle it.
53,8,"Vaccination is a joke, because it's a joke, because it's not a joke. The article says they can use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases. They can't use it to prevent other diseases."
70,8,That's why it's a prank. People who don't understand tarot cards have no idea what a prank is and don't want to do anything about it. People who don't understand tarot cards can't understand tarot cards.
74,8,I don't see how this is a joke at all. There is nothing wrong with wearing a mask to prevent people from getting HIV. It's not even a joke. A prank is a joke. The tarot card isn't a joke. It's one of the most commonly used tarot cards around.
80,8,"I would love to have the president do the whole Obama thing as a president. I'm sorry, but I can't speak for all of them."
81,8,So... you're just in no position to say that a tarot card is a joke.
86,8,"""The whole thing is a joke. It's not a joke because they are not going to make a joke, but they are absolutely fucking ignorant."""
87,8,It's not a tarot card. It's a deck of tarot cards.
98,8,There are actually a few ways to do this.
27,8,The government doesn't care about the health of the public. The president is the one who is the bad choice for the Republican Party.
28,8,It's a joke that if you don't take it seriously and tell your boss you are not comfortable with it. It's actually a joke to prevent rape and to prevent it in the future.
35,8,"""Although I'm not a lawyer. I'm a doctor. And I don't think this is a joke, but it's a joke because they want to make fun of the people who are making fun of this guy."""
36,8,"In the UK, it's illegal to do it in public places."
47,8,It's very common for a joke to get a big thumbs up over one person or to be able to make it all the way out of the way. If it wasn't for the CDC I wouldn't be comfortable wearing it unless I was sick and infected.
49,8,And it's been a joke because the government is trying to make people more aware that it's not a joke - it's actually a joke because it's not a joke.
52,8,It's the best part of the entire thing. The fact that we have a public policy and can't make fun of the tarot is a logical and scientific explanation for a joke. We aren't in a position to make fun of the government. We can't make fun of the tarot. We can make fun of our politicians.
53,8,I think he is being sarcastic...
70,8,Vaccination is only a way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
