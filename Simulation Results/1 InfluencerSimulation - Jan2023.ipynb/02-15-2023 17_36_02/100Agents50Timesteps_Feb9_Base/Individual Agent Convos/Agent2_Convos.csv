6,2,You know a bunch of people who don't think they are going to be able to understand what they are doing?
15,2,"I do not think that's a common occurrence here. I think it would be fair to say that the problem is that you don't want to keep your mouth shut. If your mouth is shut, you can't have it shut in any sort of closed container. It's not as bad as you think. I have a friend who has always had a problem with being in a mask, and he is trying to keep the vaccination on his face."
17,2,"I'm not sure if this is the right answer or if it's just being a ""bad guy"" or the only way to go through it."

58,2,I agree with you that this is one of the dumbest things in American history and I'm so thankful to be in this position.

6,2,"Getting out of the bed in a couple of months is really scary. If you don't have a helmet, wear a helmet and a tampon. Vaccination is still very risky unless you get the vaccine. What do you think of the guy who has to be fired? How many times have you lost a mask? A new report says the helmet will still cover the body and lungs - but it won't protect the head and lungs. It can cause respiratory issues like this. Wearing a mask is also the most inconvenient thing ever"
15,2,It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person.
17,2,"You know I've heard about this before, but just a little since I woke up in the middle of nowhere."
31,2,So I got my head in the air after I lost my mask because I was out of breath and I lost my breath at a good pace?
32,2,I don't understand how it is that we are allowed to wear a mask as long as it doesn't get sick.
33,2,"As someone who is not entirely against the government's anti-viral policies, I've come to find that they're putting themselves in a very real danger of getting themselves in an oblivion. It seems like they have been using the law, but they're going to have to do more."
36,2,"I don't think you understand the point of the subtitles. Unless there's something in the title that says you are in the country of a non -NUS, and you are in a group of people who aren't vaccinated, the person that posted the post in the thread is not you."
41,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops oh you dont like wearing a mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
58,2,"You're not kidding. The government is using it to stop a virus that is spread across the planet. But, I think you're completely right. There is a lot of bad information out there about that."
69,2,I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask for sports? How does it actually count if you are a doctor?
83,2,"It's one of the most accurate comment of this whole thread. I'm a smoker so the shit out of me is that I don't work very well, I always wear a mask I'm supposed to wear, like a sham to wear for the most part."
84,2,I like the idea of a mask if it was to stop the spread of the virus. But to be honest it's the only one I can see as having a face.
87,2,"OP, the president said the whole thing is a scam."
91,2,I know I am putting on a mask that is only a few inches across but I have tried to get it off and then it is a real pain and I'm doing that in my spare time because it really is the best way to go. But when you get off I'm going to try to get a mask - and then it's on and I can't get it off.

99,2,"if you can get your mask right, you will be able to buy a lot of things by using it."
2,1,The President doesn't know anything about the virus so we don't know.
6,2,Vaccinations are a serious disease. Vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses (which is a really big concern for the CDC) and also are important to avoid the spread.
15,2,">I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a fucking racist. Why is that being a racist?"
17,2,My parents have a helmet. We just wear them for work.
31,2,I think the best solution to stop the spread of this disease would be to get vaccinated and get vaccinated.
32,2,You have a very good point.
33,2,>What kind of rules do you have on it? Have you worn your mask?
36,2,>[personalism - I have a mask. And I wear a mask.](http://www.i.vaccine.gov/publications/twitchcon/news/publications/twitch_and_fake/news/).
41,2,"This is an example of a terrible political attitude. It has nothing to do with the morals of the story, it doesn't matter how much it hurts others. I don't want to put down this, I want to put down that it's a great joke."
58,2,I think the problem is that it's not a joke.
69,2,"I've never had a problem with wearing a mask in a concert. What's a mask for? I was vaccinated, but not as a medical professional. The only time I ever got a mask was when my partner smoked and they smoked me. I couldn't wear them unless I had something serious to do. I was probably also an athlete, not a professional. But that was my first time when I was vaccinated. I'm not saying I couldn't help, but if I were a professional I would definitely wear "
83,2,I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates.
84,2,A good one at that. Were you in Florida?
87,2,"This is the only reason you have to be in a government with the right to do nothing. You're right, if you don't want to go to the doctor because you don't want to risk getting into the ER, you might as well do it yourself. This is one of those things where you have to be in a hospital to take care of people."
91,2,"It's a sign of a broken system. There are plenty of ways to 'put a mask on' when it's not necessary for a normal day-to-day living situation. You don't have to do anything, because you don't want to."

99,2,"This guy really is a scam, he is just trying to convince us."
2,1,"The truth is that Vaccinations are a serious disease, and prevent it from spreading in public."
6,2,"> I’ve never done a job without a mask. I’m going to say that if the state town doesn’t have mandates, you can’t get mad that an event doesn’t have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters"
15,2,"...i've seen a bunch of fake news stories that I had to watch for. A mask that is the size of a regular backpack, like a holster, with the right amount of space, and the correct amount of energy?"
17,2,"i know that sounds a little naive. I know this is not right for me, but my mother used to be a doctor and I figured a mask was really just that. she was wearing a hat when i was little, but not really."
31,2,I'm going to have to apologize and apologize.
32,2,I don't think it's a bad idea to have a hat on and wear it when you need it most of the time. I don't think it's a good idea to keep a mask on.
33,2,No you should not be in the government.
36,2,Is there a name that says it's a scam?
41,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,2,"I think your OP is right, but I think the government should not use the mask to stop an infection because it can be harmful."
69,2,"There are some very good, unofficial rules that are made to prevent a lawsuit from taking place. A lot of people get vaccinated to prevent a lawsuit, but it is often not. Vaccination is necessary to protect peoples health. I'd like to be vaccinated because it is essential to protect peoples health."
83,2,Is the government going to be able to get vaccines into our state?
84,2,"I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. This is actually not true."
87,2,The President's a hypocrite and it doesn't matter what he says. He's a real president.
91,2,There are a lot of ways to wear a mask when they are not necessary for a normal day-to-day living situation.
92,2,"AIDS is not a thing. Rather, it's a disease and it can't be removed or treated unless you have a mask. This isn't the same as taking an AIDS med. It has nothing to do with being a man."
99,2,The thing to remember to do is make friends with someone who will tell them how to make a good business with a mask.
2,1,"I know it's a little sad, but I want to know why a bunch of people in this sub haven't taken the time to read the whole article. I have no idea where you're getting the whole concept of vaccines, and I don't really see why. The whole idea is pretty ridiculous. It's all I've ever heard of a medical professional stating a doctor's job is to be on top of a hat in order to save my life, because he's also got a very large hat. That's all I"

15,2,"You don't need a holster in order to get around a disease. And your friend isn't going to get any meds by just putting your face in it. Your friends mask isn't going to go anywhere near your face and it's going to get all drooling, and all of a sudden your friend isn't going to be able to afford a full vaccination program and a mask that can be placed into your face."
17,2,Vaccination is NOT required in your country to prevent the spread of a virus. It's required for the first time in a million years of public health (e.g. vaccinated people in the country.) If you're not in the US it is a criminal offense.
31,2,I'm going to have to apologize and apologize.
32,2,"The CDC (http://www.pa.gov/dpr/insecurities/pa.gov/securities) are using the phrase ""coach"" because it has an actual purpose. In my mind this is just as bad as a fake vaccine. I think if you have it as a joke, it's going to be infected with it, and that's where it's coming from. But it's still a joke."
33,2,"I'd go as far as to say it is a joke, but that this is really what it is, a prank. I have no idea how this works but I am the opposite."

41,2,"This is the most obvious thing about the government and how people are perceived and how their actions affect people, because people don't just wear a mask all the time, and the government does nothing wrong. There's an enormous amount of information available online about how the government treats the medical profession in various ways, from the people involved to the people themselves. It's a pretty shitty thing to say."
58,2,It sounds like the problem with that book is that the government has no business using the mask because it's so dangerous that it's a joke that is really stupid.
69,2,>I've never had a problem with wearing a mask in a concert.
83,2,The government should also be able to help prevent the spread of viruses.
84,2,"I'm in California so I would probably not like to be on a mask, but if I was able to, I would rather not get staph than infected. My parents have never gotten vaccinated and had been in infected. I'm from Texas, so that may be the biggest symptom of the virus."

87,2,The AIDS fucking government raps people of all kinds. It is a real fucking shit.
91,2,"I don't think you understand what 'putting on a mask' means. It's the word ""putting on a mask""."
92,2,It is a scam and is a part of the AIDS response. The doctor told her to keep the mask and get her medically ready to make a doctor come. It has nothing to do with being a man.
99,2,"A friend of mine lost his tarot card because of this. They have been trying to scam him with it since he was 17 to help a friend get his tarot cards back, but that doesn't make sense. He lost it because he thought it was an expensive, cheap way to do a good job and he wasn't sure if it would work for him."
2,1,The tarot card is a great thing to have around. A lot of people would be a little more inclined to wear a mask to do something that may not be necessary for the actual CDC vaccine and just have it on for a moment to go.
6,2,People have said this before. What is the meaning of masks? What are they meant to be used for?

36,2,"I don't think it's a scam. I would take the CDC to their place, let the virus spread through your body."

87,2,So isn't every politician on the planet a troll?
91,2,I don't understand what it means. I'm sorry. I am sorry.

32,2,I don't see why the CDC is making money off jokes. This is just a joke that's thrown around by people who don't know about the real AIDS epidemic.
33,2,I'm assuming you read the comments to me.
36,2,"There was a lot of fake tarot cards going around that came out in the 80s and 90s, but only a small proportion were still vaccinated. It's really not that new, at least not in the US. The thing that got a lot of people in '60s was that people didn't know the tarot was fake. So people are not supposed to use a tarot card."
41,2,I'm going to end this.
58,2,I'd say they are shit people. The tarot card is the best tarot card I've ever read.
69,2,This is a lot of shit!
83,2,The people who are doing viral research on TWC are also the ones who are ignoring the sexist gimmick. The government is not limiting the benefits and does not prevent them from reducing the spread of viruses.
84,2,"Well, the CDC is doing their job. I'm just saying that I really don't think it is worth it."
87,2,"In general, people like to keep a mask on because a bunch of people are wearing them, especially at the same time. In general, the tarot cards are not a good idea to put on the person. It can be a bad idea because it shows that the person is wearing a mask, but there is nothing wrong with that. I agree that it's a good idea, but the one I agree with is that people are looking at a tarot card as a means of describing a situation, and they don't have any idea what it has"
91,2,"This is funny, because it's a petty joke."
92,2,"It's probably a scam that's probably been around a long time, but I've been in a lot of different situations and my friends have never told me about it. It was a long time ago, but it was a scam. I lost it, I went to a shelter, I went to a doctor, and the man told me how it was a scam. That was a scam. He told me it was a scam, he was not aware of it, and he got it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"
99,2,I think it's an awful way of looking at the tarot deck.
2,1,...and they're both going to do exactly that! The whole thing is a joke.

41,2,"AIDS is a symptom of the US being more aware and taking care of the virus than most other people. In terms of the real problem, this is something that I have to deal with in the future."

41,2,There is an important distinction in that I think it is in a lot of ways.
58,2,"I can read the card now, but that book's got an odd snide tarot card in it. I can't read it without feeling very dickish."
69,2,"I see the one in the title. That's a very good one. I have never been at any concerts without a mask, though. So it would be funny to see a clown around, or even a politician."
83,2,"I'd also say he's a doctor, and that this was ""the kind of joke I've heard on this thread and when I hear it, it makes me feel so bad."""
84,2,"I'm a doctor, and I get sick, but I don't get sick. Is this a joke, a joke, or something that is funny?"

15,2,"I don't think it's a joke, but it sounds like they have a history of racism. The joke is about the CDC and it's propaganda, not about the CIA. The CIA is involved in spreading the CDC's propaganda, and in fact, is in fact helping with it."

32,2,The word 'coach' doesn't seem to mean a symphony joke. The actual joke is a joke stating that it prevents people from getting AIDS if they don't have a mask. The CDC hasn't even stated it is a joke.
33,2,He's in a nipple now.
36,2,You can't tell me exactly what a tarot card looks like in the US.
41,2,"The only reason I can consider a joke is because it's a joke and I don't believe in the CDC. They are attempting to get rid of people that actually get the vaccine. The CDC is a scam, but they are trying to convince people to get the vaccine."
58,2,That's a good thing you don't want to read this a lot if you are going to be taking it too seriously. The doctor doesn't seem to get that kind of reaction from the CDC and the whole thing is a joke.
69,2,"I have a mask for my car and it's in the glove compartment in the parking lot at the event, in case there's a problem."
83,2,It is a joke. I've been vaccinated against HIV and he didn't even mention it because he's an agnostic politician.
84,2,The CDC needs to keep this meme out of a public discussion.

99,2,The tarot is a scam because it isn’t a deck. It’s a scam because it isn’t a deck. The trick is to get the right one.
2,1,I'm actually going to be trying to give you some context for your own post. It's been my pleasure to listen.
6,2,"Despite what the people on here said, it seems like they are pretty accurate and a good idea for this."
15,2,"Vaccination is a joke, 'but it's a joke. '"
17,2,I think there is a great difference between the joke and the joke.
31,2,I don't think a joke is a joke because it is. It's just a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.
32,2,"A tarot deck translates to a joke because it says that it can prevent HIV, not AIDS."
33,2,That is a really good point. It's also interesting that the CDC is trying to make it seem like they are trying to slander us.
36,2,"I have a tarot card called a tarot card, which means that it's a card with a specific sign on the bottom and a'scroll' icon in the center and a'scroll' icon in the center. But a card that is actually a tarot card has no point."
41,2,"It is a joke, and I think it is a joke because of what you said."
58,2,I'm not even going to go through this. The thing about tampons that they're a joke is that the author was a tarot card player.
69,2,A lot of people have a problem with wearing a mask at a concert.
83,2,The whole thing is a joke.
84,2,The joke was in response to the quote: Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
87,2,"”The first thing you say is that it’s a good idea to put on the person. It can be a bad idea because it shows that the person is wearing a mask, but there is nothing wrong with that. I think it’s a good idea to be sure that you know what you are talking about."
91,2,"I've read the articles on the subject. They all make me think that people are trying to get away with it. They don't see the joke being serious but they know people are talking about it a lot. I can't even start to think that the actual joke is a joke, and they seem to be trying to get rid of some of the sexist stuff in a lot of ways that have no practical application."
92,2,"A great scam is one that you can do without any medication or care to avoid it, and you can make the doctor happy. It's not a scam at all. It's a scam, as long as you don't get vaccinated yourself and don't go into details with the doctor."
99,2,There's a huge gap between the US and Canada. The story is referencing the fact that the person who made the fake tarot deck is a scammer.
2,1,"Vaccination is a serious illness. It's a serious reason for not vaccinating. Vaccinations are a serious disease. It’s a serious disease, and prevents it from spreading in public. Vaccination is a serious illness. Vaccinations are an effective method of preventing it from spreading, and prevents it from spreading in public."
6,2,It's a joke because it's based on a tarot card. The first thing that came to mind was the fact that the tarot is actually a joke. The second thing that came to mind is the fact that the CDC is making it a joke.
15,2,"Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke."
17,2,This is not a joke. It is an absolute joke.
31,2,>It's a joke because it's a joke
32,2,What's the best way to get a tarot card without wearing it?
33,2,The only thing that matters is the way it looks in the media.
36,2,"CDC is investigating a number of issues with the fake tarot cards. I don't think it's a scam, but it's a very common reason to not vaccinate people with HIV. I just think it's too much work."
41,2,No. This is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
58,2,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
69,2,CANNOTANSWER: I think there is a lot of shit about this. The government is the cause of the problem.
83,2,I was just reading the story about a guy who was a doctor for over two years. It was a joke and everyone was being sexist. The joke wasn’t really a joke. The story was just a joke and a joke. Neither are true.
84,2,"Well, if you are in the US, they are going to get a tampon for people not vaccinated. The CDC isn't even doing anything about it, but I think the idea is still a joke."
87,2,"AIDS is not a joke, it's the most important disease. HIV is the most important disease."
91,2,Getting on the street and then eating is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life.
92,2,AIDS is a very serious and virulent disease. It isn't a virus and it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
99,2,The thing about tarot is that it doesn't really matter to people because they think tarot is a deck. It's an allegory that has to do with it being a card. It's the tarot itself. The problem with tarot cards is that they're actually decks. It's a game and a game in its own right. I'm not really sure what to say in the world about the fact that 'ask someone's tarot and they're making a joke'.
2,1,This sub is not going to work.
6,2,"That's not a joke. This is a joke. The CDC has created a tarot deck called 'The Apocalypse of the Wind' which is pretty funny. It contains the tarot cards, a number that are in common, and can be used for a number of different purposes."
15,2,"What kind of joke is it? Like? Unless someone said it was a joke, then I don't see how a prank is a joke."
17,2,> I think the issue is that it's not a joke. It's an absolute joke.
31,2,"So... you're saying, 'It's a joke because it's a joke. I just think it's a joke.'"

83,2,The CDC is not responsible for the spread of a virus. They would be unable to stop any hives. And I do know that there are dozens of companies that are looking for companies to sell vaccines to the public.
84,2,"No, because the CDC needs to do the job it's supposed to do."
87,2,It is a scam because it has the ability to go off the ground and go straight to a doctor. It's probably not the most likely outcome.

2,1,I am actually very disappointed that I haven't done this since I was 13 when it started happening. I think it was a lot of fun to just not look at the tarot while it was there. That is to say that I was really surprised at the lack of clarity on the subject as I was starting to feel like I was in an interesting place.
6,2,CANNOTANSWER: A good CDC official would rather have a joke than be a doctor. The other comments about a joke are about the actual CDC.
