70,54,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
73,54,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."

90,54,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
100,54,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
54,3,"I've never been in a public bathroom and have a crowbar! What can I do? I've got a crowbar, so I can't do it. I don't know how I've got one, I've had a lot of people do that. They are being egregiously stupid. I've been exposed to a few aphids, but nothing in the way of what to do when you go there."
54,25,"I was in NY when the president lied about not wearing a mask when the administration was still threatening to sue. I guess that's why they kept it in place. Until then, they always thought they were good to go out on a limb. I think it makes sense to keep them in place."
54,45,"I've never seen a doctor put on a mask in front of someone, they can't even say a thing about the mask, and it's not like they've ever had a STI or anything like that, it's just a symptom of disease."
70,54,i do a lot of dumb things to prevent the spread of a virus
73,54,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
82,54,"The scumbags, they're doing it wrong."
89,54,"I have a mask that fits my nostrils, it doesn't make sense. I don't wear it because it's too much work and not enough sneeze if the smoke leaks."
90,54,"It is actually kind of difficult to get a vaccine, but you know what you can do to keep yourself healthy? Have you got it, can you?"
100,54,"I want to see a clip of the song, ""Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are. Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are. Little blue ones are totally useless."
54,3,"What I've read seems a bit misleading. I just don't like the fact that it's something that's been made into a joke in the past, and it's also not as easy as figuring out the fact that you've been exposed to a few aphids, but you can't do what you're doing. You have to show them that you're not wearing your mask and not really being able to breathe. It's weird but it's not very good for you, and unless they do have an official website in NY they"
54,25,I know what you're thinking but i'm trying to remember the lyrics to this song that was a little apologies:
54,45,"I think this is a very valid question. It's not your fault for not being comfortable wearing a mask, but for not wearing it."
70,54,It's not about you. It's about your mask.
73,54,"It's not really a ""free"" or ""non-payable"" thing to wear a mask with all of the health insurance coverage in place. But you know what I'm trying to say: it's not a bad idea and the people who don't need one do not want to be associated with them."
82,54,I don't know what a scumbag is saying.
89,54,"I'm not a doctor, but I work in a health facility that provides a set of masks. I work on a lot of it."
90,54,"It is actually kind of difficult to get a vaccine, but you know what you can do to keep yourself healthy? Have you got it, can you?"
100,54,I love the video and want to say that it isn't really useless but I also like to say that it's a pretty cool and scary song. I'm not sure what it would be about it but in the video it says it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit scary.
54,3,"I mean I do not believe in wearing masks. I have a lot of stuff that I can wear and I've learned about it, so I'm trying to use it as a tool."
54,25,A lot of people have a mask or a mask and the resulting infection is just a symptom of the virus.
54,45,"There is a song about that called ""Ripe."" It's on Netflix and it's just a song about an American girl getting tested and getting a vaccine."
70,54,">I've been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don't really think it's a big deal. I’ve been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don’t really think it’s a big deal."
73,54,Is there anything wrong with a mask?
82,54,"No one cares if they get vaccinated. The truth is that they will not get vaccinated until you become sick. That's a pretty common misconception. Regardless of whether it's illegal or not, people need to get vaccinated as soon as they can. The fact is that a lot of people don't even want to talk about that because they want to prevent the spread of a virus. I think he's having a lot of fun with this stuff."
89,54,That's a nice way to put it.
90,54,"The government has no mandate to mandate ""You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandate"" It's scary how dumb they think all of is are. Little blue ones are completely useless.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage."
100,54,"I'm an alcoholic, and I know it's scary. My favorite song is the ""Birthday in the City"" because it's not the most fun song I have ever heard."
54,3,"This isn't a joke. This is a fad. There's no law against it, they just don't understand how the government should do this."
54,25,"I'm an alcoholic, and I know it's scary."
54,45,If you've ever been in a CDC emergency shelter and never been vaccinated. It's one of those things where you'll have to explain how you can't breathe when you're wearing a mask and that you're not allowed to breathe while you are in the hospital.
70,54,"What if you can’t just eat a sandwich? Because, you don’t have to."
73,54,"The truth is not always what we know. That's why we don't get our helmets. The fuck is this the truth? I'm the man that invented the new cbp and a mask. No one wants to tell me about the lack of any laws about it. It's a joke and I don't care. It's not really a ""free"" or ""non-payable"" thing to wear a mask with all of the health insurance coverage in place. But you know what I want to do with them."
82,54,I hate when people wear masks in public and it's a pretty common misconception. It is just a scam and a misinformation and you're being facetious.
89,54,"[Babie, I didn't know you were able to see my eyelids.](https://www.adv.org/) You need to see your nose first."
90,54,"It's a cliche, it is just silly."
100,54,My mom got me the song when I was very young so I was pretty surprised it wasn't a virus.
54,3,"[I'm not gonna get you a joke here.](https://www.adv.org/) You need to see your nose first. It's a cliche, it is just silly."
54,25,">I've been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don't really think it's a big deal.

54,45,It sounds like we’re talking about a fad in the media. I think this is the worst thing I’ve heard all week.
70,54,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it isn't necessary."
73,54,No one wants to tell you about the lack of any laws about it.
82,54,>It's a common misconception to get a mask and not be vaccinated?
89,54,"This is why you don't wear a mask at all, and because a mask is only a mask that is breathable."
90,54,"Yeah, I can't even imagine what a cliche would be. ""You can hate me if the state town doesn't have a mandate. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters."
100,54,I don't have a problem with my life. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people.
54,3,I don't think that they should do this. They are putting masks on people who eat food. They don't need to be vaccinated.
54,25,"You need to see your nose first. It's a cliche, it is just silly."
54,45,I'm a vaccinated person with boosters.
70,54,The fact that you have to do what you want to do is kind of alarming to me.
73,54,"Yes, we have to make sure that AIDS is treated properly. This is the only thing they can do with a mask because it is not a good idea and it isn't going to change."
82,54,>I'm genuinely chuckle.
89,54,"Unless it’s not a funny joke, I don’t think the joke is relevant here."
90,54,"> It's a cliche, it is just silly."
100,54,'I don't have a problem with my life. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people.'
54,3,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it's not necessary."
54,25,"It's not funny at all, I don't like it at all."
54,45,"It’s not a cliche, it is just silly. Vaccination isn’t a good idea, but it isn’t necessary. No one wants to tell you about the lack of any laws about it. I’ve been working for the CDC and they are reporting it every day because they have a virus on the ground, so I don’t really think it’s a big deal.

70,54,"[In the United States, if used correctly, is considered a medical malpractice. That said, it's not a medical malpractice. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."
73,54,"The president is telling a lie in this thread he can't stop a public health attack on another human being that he cannot ban him from playing, and there is some sort of moral problem with this."
82,54,"This is very well known. There is a lot of truth in a lot of things, and if you're not a fan of the fake ones, you're in for a huge long ride."
89,54,"""We want to protect our citizens against the dangers of masks."" Is that what the joke is supposed to mean?"
90,54,I agree. I think this is one of the things people are thinking about - it would be a cliche to call a vaccinated person a 'vaccinated person with boosters'.
100,54,I have a friend who is sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people.
54,3,"I know what you mean, but we do not know. I do not know what to do."
54,25,"The fact that you need to see your nose first. It’s not funny at all, I don’t like it at all."
54,45,"They need a new Vaccine/Measuring system in place to keep people from getting AIDS in their community. Vaccinations don't protect them from a contaminated population. They're not a fad. If they don't have one, they can't even take them a step up."
70,54,I think it's pretty interesting that the government can't have a government agency in place to prevent the spread of the virus.
73,54,"The first three things to come to my mind in a paragraph, after I've been asked:"
82,54,"So, you said you want to get vaccinated when you don't, so the answer is no. The CDC is making a sweeping public declaration that it's scam."
89,54,This is actually the one you need to read the title and read through this post. This is a lot of information about masks.
90,54,"I just came across a meme that states ""I'm a vaccinatist with boosters. I'm a vaccinatist with boosters."" It's pretty sad to see how much fucking ridiculous it's become these days."
100,54,I know that it's not the only one I hear. It's an extremely sad one.
54,3,"Is this the first time the government's been talking about the masks, I was surprised that they were not actually putting them on people."
54,25,Is the name of the person in the story?
54,45,"You are absolutely right. I do not believe in a vaccine and can't understand how someone would have problems breathing while wearing a mask when they are wearing a mask, even when they are feeling sick. I don't think a vaccine is a good idea, but it isn't a good idea."
70,54,People wear masks to protect themselves. They don't get sick from it.
73,54,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,54,"""...I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."""
89,54,"I don’t wear a mask, but I do know that if a sick person wears one, they don’t have to deal with it, so the CDC is going to keep trying to prevent people from committing a crime that people are more likely to commit."
90,54,Vaccination is not illegal in every state. The CDC won't enforce them. Vaccination in the US is NOT illegal in every state. They're the only organization I've been in contact with that actually has an actual mandate on vaccinating a child.
100,54,AIDS is not a disease. It's a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread the disease. I don't know much about this. I think the message of the song is the idea that if a doctor can't help spread the disease it's more of an epidemic than anything else.
54,3,The CDC and all the other health agencies are not going to enforce it.
54,25,"Vaccination is a very traumatic and very common disease, and in all likelihood the same is true of people. The only time the CDC can have a mandate on vaccination is in the past, but that is now a policy that states that if you don't go to a CDC office it can be a criminal offense."
54,45,It's also a myth that the CDC is making a sweeping public declaration that it's scam.
70,54,The whole point of a hat is to hide the virus.
73,54,">Is this really a joke? You're an idiot, who is an idiot unless you want to prove him wrong. I'm sure it's not even the same thing. A mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,54,It would be a scam to try and cover up the fact that the CDC is trying to get people to stop getting vaccinated.
89,54,I'm sick of this. I can't imagine what I would have done if I weren't wearing a mask.
90,54,I don't see it.
100,54,They don't do that because it's not something that's a bad idea.
54,3,It's a joke. The government should make it as a good thing to wear a mask.
54,25,"The CDC does not enforce a mandate on vaccines. It only enforces one mandate on vaccines, not to do so in order to protect people from the risk of becoming ill."
54,45,I’ve heard a ton of people complain about not getting vaccinated on the news.
70,54,The mask isn't going to stop the spread of the AIDS. The CDC isn't even really doing it at this point.
73,54,You don't have to be an idiot to make a joke.
82,54,The CDC is trying to make a public declaration that it's a scam. The problem is that they are making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
89,54,"I am not saying that it's a joke, but it is misleading."
90,54,I've only seen this in one country. There's a song about it on the radio and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus.
100,54,"I know how sad that song is, and I was able to listen to it when I was in the hospital. I was very angry with myself because I had to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it."
54,3,We just found out a few years ago that someone wearing a mask on a child is going to get a heart attack if it is worn inappropriately.
54,25,It's a joke. I've seen it on the news in a few countries but I haven't been able to find any evidence to back up it.
54,45,Vaccination isn't actually a good idea. It isn't being enforced. It's also being made out of a myth that it's a scam.
70,54,"They don't want people to be able to stop it by being able to protect themselves. This is part of the point of a mask. If the mask is used properly, it is not a good idea. It's a bit like ""We have a new CDC policy, but it doesn't apply to everybody.""..."
73,54,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,54,The CDC is making a public declaration that it's a scam. The problem is that they are making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam. The problem is that they are making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
89,54,Basically... it's a joke about how a government employee should not wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading.
90,54,"I've only heard the words, ""Vaccination is a good idea. But I don't think it's a good idea. It's a meme."" I'm also a twitchcon mask."
100,54,"I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but this is a really good quote from a doctor."
54,3,"This is a joke, because it's a joke, not a joke."
54,25,... I've heard a ton of people complain about not getting vaccinated on the news. The mask isn't actually a good idea.
54,45,I know that one person I worked with said he wasn’t a doctor because he was sick. I didn’t know anyone said he didn’t wear a mask when he had a STI.
70,54,Vaccination isn’t a medical malpractice. It’s a medical malpractice. The government isn’t doing it at all and not even aware that it is being implemented in a medical manner.
73,54,I don't think it is a joke because it isn't true and because it isn't a joke because it is a joke.
82,54,I'm a doctor and I am a doctor. And this is just what I'm doing.
89,54,"People in the military should know, right? Unless they’re medically ill, and have a lot of money, they don’t need a mask."
90,54,"I agree. But when I think about it, it kind of strikes me as weird and I feel a little ill. I think the only thing that works for me, is my job, but I can't say whether I want to go to a TWitchcon party."
100,54,"“He said it was very sad and I was able to listen to it a couple of times a day when it was supposed to go on. I didn't like it a lot, so I had to watch it. I didn't like it a lot. I didn't like it a lot."
54,3,">I can't wear my mask because it hurts, I don't like it and I've got a crowbar, so I can't do it. I don't know how I've got one, I've had a lot of people do that."
54,25,"I don't think I've heard a ton of people complain about not getting vaccinated on the news. The mask isn't a good idea, it's an excuse to keep it on, and it's just one thing to keep your head in a state where you can't find any evidence of it and not a thing to keep you in it."
54,45,I feel bad for those who have to watch this shit all day.
70,54,A prank? This one is pretty funny.
73,54,"That's what my father said to me while he was working in the Army. It's like they're being paid for the service, right?"
82,54,No tarot card ever isn't a scam because a card is a tarot card. It is a scam because they do what they can to stop people from getting vaccinated and not to prevent people from getting vaccinated. I think he has been fooling himself by not being able to use it in public. I don't like that the CDC is telling people that the tarot card is a scam and is trying to make the government think it is a scam
89,54,This guy has a serious infection.
90,54,"I think the only thing that works for me is my job, but I can't say whether I want to go to a TWitchcon party. I think the only thing that works for me is my job, but I can't say whether I want to go to a TWitchcon party."
100,54,"I don't think it would be funny or fun to say. It isn't so much about the AIDS or anything that would make you laugh - it's the message of the song that it is about how the government is using the mask to combat the disease. It's like saying, ""I don't know what the message of the song is, but I like it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit bit scary. I love the video and want to say that it isn't the most fun song"""
54,3,You should wear your mask at least once or twice a week and wear it at least once a week as your daily go to to get your stuff.
54,25,The song is a prank by the government.
54,45,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it's not necessary. No one wants to tell you about the lack of any laws about it."
70,54,I've heard of people who would say that it's a prank.
73,54,"A fake tarot card, and the only thing to use it as a joke, to stop AIDS."
82,54,"I'm not a lawyer, but I know a doctor who has seen this before. I can see how there's a lot of truth to it, and I'm not a lawyer."
89,54,"This is not funny at all, it's just a joke."
90,54,"Vaccination prevents diseases like AIDS. It's not about preventing deaths, it's about treating diseases like a disease. Vaccination is a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme."
100,54,This is the biggest issue I've had with the government.
54,3,I think the guy that was putting the mask on got fucked up.
54,25,[NAME](http://www.nevada.gov/PageSam) is the CDC's governing body for a number of reasons.
54,45,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I agree. But when I think about it, it kind of strikes me as weird and I feel a little ill."
70,54,"A lot of people aren't so sure about a joke, especially given that many of them can only understand the words ""prank."""
73,54,"I'm sure it isn't a joke, because you're talking about the fact that he's a fake tarot card hat."
82,54,"IANAL: I'm a huge fan of the people who use them, but they're not scammers. People put on masks as jokes. They are not making the joke. They are using a tarot card as a way to stop people from getting vaccinated and not to prevent people from getting vaccinated. The most important thing to remember in your life is to never have any of the disease. You have to find a new disease. The more it gets done, the more it becomes more likely that there will be an etymologist"
89,54,"I'm a military doctor. I don't wear a mask because I don't know how I can see my eyelids, but I'm sick of it."
90,54,I'm so sorry to hear this.
100,54,"If it's a good song, I like it and hope it's the one to say to people."
54,3,It's all part of the campaign to end AIDS.
54,25,"That song is hilarious. I agree, I like it, but I can't really say what I'm saying about it. The CDC is not an official entity or corporation."
54,45,"I believe in a safe, natural cure for all forms of AIDS. I don't want to be that naive about it."
70,54,There are a few reasons people don't like it if there are masks. Like if you have a scar on your face and you have a snooping hunch in your mouth and your eyes open. That's the whole point of a mask. But that's not what it's about.
73,54,"I see that he is a fool, if the government has any legal rights to people who don't want to wear a mask, then he's going to do it. But as a president, I just want to let you know that people who don't have a mask will probably think this one's a joke that is just a joke — because people can't keep it off the ground for the time being. If someone does, then I think you're a fool."
82,54,I'd like to see you read the tarot deck and the story.
89,54,I can't believe how much money he gets for that. He's in the military.
90,54,"That's a nice way to talk about the internet, like you're an avid reader, like I'm a real proponent of the CDC."
100,54,"I love that song, I love the song and love to say that it sounds nice and the title doesn't say a tid bit bit scary."
54,3,"I had a friend that had one in a restroom, and he said it was a 'crowbar', but he didn't wear it because he wanted to make fun of the person. This fucked him up and he would get shit rubbed on him. I think that's why people wear the crowbar on because it's funny."
54,25,"It's the first part of a series on an ongoing campaign to end AIDS, which is the main source of controversy in the United States."
54,45,Vaccination is actually a good idea for keeping people from getting AIDS in their community. Vaccinations don't protect them from a contaminated population. CDC makes a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
70,54,"Yes, but if the CDC isn’t doing it, then it’s a joke. It’s actually about the people who are playing the card."
73,54,if he is actually being a jerk he is probably going to stop talking to people and not go to the doctor as a joke.
82,54,The CDC is trying to make a public declaration that it is a scam. They are not supposed to cover everything up.
89,54,"I am sorry but the way I phrased it, when I found out about this card - and I had to look it up, I couldn't get myself to read it in all the ways it says it does. I just had a hard time feeling good because it was a joke."
90,54,"You know, like a lot of people, people are doing this to stop the spread of AIDS. It's illegal to vaccinate children in any state in the US, so why not do it in another country? It would be an absurdity to not have a mandate to vaccinate children in the US. But I think I'm trying to put a stop to it, because I think there is a lot of discussion there about this a few years ago. It's the only thing that I've heard about that it's just a joke."
100,54,"I've heard the word in the title, which has the meaning of ""I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but this is a really good quote from a doctor""."

54,25,"I'm not a tarot reader, but I've seen a few funny quotes that were used to back off on it."
54,45,It's an old joke if it's made up.
70,54,"I'm a tarot card reader and I used to work in the CDC. There's a pretty big difference. I don't think the CDC really cares about you at all about the AIDS virus. That said, it sounds pretty funny."

90,54,They're just trying to get the CDC to take a more conservative approach. There's no law to prevent a person from having AIDS. They need to do it in the US to get it out.
100,54,It was a joke. The lyrics sounded like a joke and I don't like it. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people.

70,54,I'm gonna use a tarot card to spell out what you're going to call a prank.
73,54,I think it was a joke – a joke - for the jokers who think the president is a jerk about tarot cards. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke – because they're making people think the government is just going to push the joke.
82,54,"Vaccination is a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. The most important thing to remember in your life is to never have any of the disease. You have to find a new disease. The more it gets done, the more it becomes more likely that there will be an etymologist,"""

100,54,Y’all are really just being sarcastic. This is a really very sad song. I guess you could say that because the only thing AIDS would make is a mask and that the government isn’t trying to help it. I don’t know what it’s all about.
54,3,">What I know is a bit misleading. I just don't like the fact that it's something that's been made into a joke in the past, and it's also not as easy as figuring out the fact that the person that was putting the mask on got fucked up."
54,25,"It's not a prank, he's a joke. The CDC can't enforce any mandates on vaccines and no one can make a joke about it. They're making it hard for them to get involved in a fight."
54,45,"I'm gonna take it one step at a time and get all the info you need. You're right, we should be getting some of this information asap."
70,54,"I think we all have some kind of prejudice against wearing a mask and being a prankster. I think that if they were to make a joke, the government wouldn't want to make the joke and it's not a joke."
73,54,It was a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. I think it is a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke.
82,54,"Vaccination is a scam because they want to stop it from spreading, and it is not a scam."
89,54,I would make the most of this.
90,54,"No, not this one. But it's a meme."
100,54,"This is what my wife is saying in her song. She explains that she thinks that it's a joke. I can't understand why people are getting sick of the things they're saying and how a few times a day, I can't see that they're trying to make a point and that it's not a joke."
54,3,What you want is to be a crowbar.
54,25,"It's not the only way to get a virus out, it's a joke."
54,45,"[Pictures are a thing. I don't want to believe anything that a CDC is trying to force out on me but I do want to believe it's a joke and it's a joke. I do want to believe that I can get the CDC to stop trying to get me to wear the mask. I don't want to risk the country's health by going to a party, but I haven't really been through the CDC."
70,54,"That's really strange. If a prank hat didn't stop people from having the flu, and now people are hunched over it, it's very sad. But a prank hat is like saying a hulk to a child when they get it and then fucking them up, and it's funny."
73,54,This is a really good example of how a big deal and stupid joke are if you revert back to reality and just stop shit.
82,54,"Vaccination is a scam because it prevents people from getting it, and they want it to be illegal to get vaccinated for it. The fact is that people don't like this because it's a scam."
89,54,Because I am going to suck up at a joke and get the sick guy to wear a mask.
90,54,The government is working to change it. They are working hard to change it. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working.
100,54,Is the song about the government? Probably not.
54,3,Vaccination is an important thing.
54,25,My wife's husband has always been a huge fan of the CDC.
54,45,"Vaccination is a bad idea, but it's an issue, as the problem is that it's not the government's job to prevent any infections on the human body. They're not trying to be that naive about it, but they haven't given the government any kind of direction on the issue."
70,54,i know it's funny but i'm going to say the whole thing isn't the correct way to respond.
73,54,I thought it was a joke because it isn't a joke.
82,54,"A CDC tarot card can be a fraud, and they will make you believe the tarot deck isn't a scam."
89,54,I'm a military doctor. I wear a mask and I'm a little uncomfortable if I have to wear a mask.
90,54,> It's pretty sad to see how much fucking ridiculous it's become these days.'
100,54,"In general, the most common misuse of the word is to ""joke"". Often, it has an inherently sarcastic or naive connotation. So you’re saying that you are not a doctor or a medic? Because that’s a good answer."
54,3,This is just a sarcastic meme. It's a really good example of how a lot of people are getting sick of the things they're saying and how a few times a day they can't see that they're trying to make a point and that it's a joke.
54,25,"It was a joke, that isn’t."
54,45,"Vaccination is the first step in getting someone to give their AIDS vaccine. Sadly, not many people actually get to experience the disease. I figured it was time to give the virus a shot."
70,54,"I don't want to be the first person to call out some people for wearing masks. I'd be saying something like, ""No. But I think it's funny. I think if we were to call you a prankster, I'm going to make a joke about you. The president is a prankster."""
73,54,"I'm the guy who said the tarot card was funny, not because the guy said it, but because the guy has a very real and real role in the country..."
82,54,"He can't have a mask in public, he just thinks it's a good joke."
89,54,I'm sorry. I'm just being frank about people wearing masks and I think it's funny. I'm just being frank about people wearing masks and I think it is funny.
90,54,"TWitchcon was a joke about a CDC thing, and it was about a mask."
100,54,"I believe this song might come from a lot of other comments in this thread, like:"
54,3,"People who wear a mask because it hurts don't want to be in public restrooms. They've been in public restrooms and have been exposed to a few aphids. They've been in the CDC bathroom and have had it on their patients, it's a great idea and is pretty much a joke."
54,25,It's funny because it's about the CDC's apolitical policy:
54,45,"Vaccination is the first step in getting someone to give their AIDS vaccine. Sadly, not many people actually get to experience the disease. I figured it was time to give the virus a shot. I figured it was time to give it a shot."

73,54,"I'm going to call the doctor and tell them I'm not a jerk, and that this joke was a joke. I don't really care, but it's a joke."
82,54,It's a scam. It's a scam because they are trying to make it clear that the CDC is not the one to do what it tries to hide.
89,54,I think you should look at this as something that's been in conversation with people from a variety of areas of the United States and abroad and you might be interested in the fact that they are using this card in a very specific way.
90,54,I think they’re trying to make a meme about the government using it to keep a bunch of people from actually being vaccinated.
100,54,"As a chemist who is using the word ""joke"" because ""The government is using it to help spread the disease. I like it and hope it's the one to say to people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people."

90,54,"I don't care about how much I disagree with the idea of a CDC mandate to prevent AIDS in any country. I think that's just a common misconception and it's not an actual mandate. I do know that is not a joke, but a joke."

54,3,"Yes, that's a good joke."
54,25,Vaccination isn’t a good idea.
54,45,The CDC doesn’t have a policy to prevent AIDS. They’re trying to make it a scam to help prevent it.
70,54,People wear a mask because it’s funny. They don’t like it. They don’t like it because people do.
73,54,I can't even imagine how I would react to the joke without asking for answers.
82,54,There's a lot of truth in the tarot deck. There are fakes. There are fakes. There's fakes. There are fakes. The fakes have fakes. I think there's a lot of truth in the tarot deck itself. It doesn't seem to work.

90,54,"I think a lot of people don't even understand the word ""middle school"" and their views on it."
100,54,AIDS is the genitals of a virus. It's not a viral disease and the government can't get rid of it.

54,25,A fucking joke. There’s more to it than that.
54,45,This is just a joke.
70,54,It's a joke. It's a joke because it's funny.

100,54,"The song is about the government trying to stop a virus that is spreading, so it's probably the song that is going to get the most upvotes besides ""At the end of the day, we're going to come to the end of the world with the death of our little children, and you're sick and sick."""
54,3,"You can't use a mask and not be able to breathe. You can't wear it, you can't be able to breathe."

54,45,"Vaccination isn't really a good idea, and it seems like they have a lot of people that have actually been vaccinated, which makes it very likely that they haven't seen a lot of people who are not."
70,54,"I think the only problem with this card is that it isn't funny, and that it isn't actually a joke."
73,54,It's a joke because a joke is a joke.
82,54,The CDC is trying to make it clear that they're not scammers. They're trying to make it clear that it's not a scam.
89,54,I think the idea is that people are really scared of the tarot cards and will become victims of it merely seems to be justification for their hate. The whole point of the tarot card is to stop the spread of a virus. It’s not a scam.
90,54,There's a reason why a lot of people don't get the vaccine. The government does not care about it.
100,54,I can't see why a person would have a problem with their body when the song is about people sick with AIDS.
54,3,"... I'm going to say, I think a lot of people are getting sick of the things they're saying, and that's a very serious case of the problem."
54,25,The CDC's governing body for a number of reasons.
54,45,I think the people who get it are just crazy about the tarot cards and think a lot of people are going to be vaccinated anyway. I think the tarot cards are a scam.
70,54,"A lot of people aren't so sure about this card, especially given that many of them can only understand the words ""prank."""
73,54,"It's not a joke to be honest, it's a good joke, and it's a joke to make you appear like a tarot card."
82,54,Vaccination is a scam because it isn't a fake. The CDC is trying to make it clear that it is not a scam. They are trying to make it clear that it's not a scam. The government is a big part of it.
89,54,- The most effective way to cite the quote from your eponymous post. - The most effective way to explain this quote is to use a tarot card.
90,54,We are talking about a problem:
100,54,AIDS is not a virus. It is a disease. It's not a virus. It's not a disease and the government can't stop it.

If we want to stop it, it would be the first thing to have a big impact on people's lives."
