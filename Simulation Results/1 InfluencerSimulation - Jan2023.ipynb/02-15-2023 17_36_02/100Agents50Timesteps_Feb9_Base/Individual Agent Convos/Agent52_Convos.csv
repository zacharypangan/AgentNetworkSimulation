52,31,"As an American who has been in the vaccinated population I cannot speak to the government or anyone who knows anything about the virus. I know that in a way, the Obama Administration seems to be a bit biased, but there's really nothing wrong with using the word mask."

61,52,They said that it is illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of the virus. This is in response to Trump's recent comments about how it can be done without making any significant change in public policy.
82,52,Yes I agree with u: 
85,52,It's the best. Especially when the person who has to wear it is in a panic or panic.
87,52,Is the whole thing fake? They are so sexist that I don't know if they believe anything.

52,5,The one and only in that case. They're just stupid. You're in the minority.
52,6,I have seen several videos containing the quote:
52,8,It's in response to the recent comments about how it can be done without making any significant change in public policy.
52,14,"I think you're being downvoted for saying a little sexist stuff. But you are not a liberal. It's not as if you don't know anything about this, but it's not an issue.

52,15,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want' to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want' to wear a mask to protect my children'."

52,31,I am going to say this to my wife for sure.
52,32,I'm glad that my friend in this thread has a mask.

52,38,"In the last 2 days, the guy who said it was ok to wear a mask said he wouldn't wear it."

82,52,"I don't care if the mask is worn or not, if it's not. I'd rather that people who wear masks do not get paid to do it."
85,52,My mom is in this situation and has been saying her friends aren't the only ones who wear masks for 4 years. She knows her friends will get some money for it.

92,52,"I lost my mask, my wife's mother's wallet, and my house, so I got my own mask, and I lost my wallet for my mom."
95,52,I think your question about the reason why one official or admin can't force a coach to wear a mask is completely inaccurate.
100,52,"I used to wear a mask in my office and I didn't like it. They got a lot of dislike. So I figured it was kinda funny and I didn't do it all the time. I tried to try to wear one, but I could've tried a different one with the same effect."
52,1,What I'm assuming is that wearing a mask is part of what the president is trying to do to help prevent the spread of the virus.
52,5,"""We're the only people who do not want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"""
52,6,Is a mask a joke or just a joke? This shit is funny.
52,8,I'm just saying that the joke is pretty funny.
52,14,I'm being sarcastic here if I think this was an op-ed but that's exactly how I feel about wearing a mask when you're sick and unable to breathe in a fluid while on the street.
52,15,I think it is strange that they are going to keep calling it a joke.
52,16,"It's funny how Trump uses ""Wearing a mask"" as a way to make a joke."

52,38,"The problem with that is that it's a joke. Not something you get to see in the media or any other publication, just a thing you do to prevent the spread of a virus."
52,39,"IANAL. But the first part is pretty hilarious, and there's no fucking way it doesn't stop the government from doing their job. They are just trying to imply that it's because of something they don't like. They're trying to scuff things with it."

85,52,"a lot of my friends are not getting their money, and my mother's just getting to go to jail."
87,52,It's a good thing that the government won't even take an AIDS test if she doesn't know the law.
90,52,I think you're the only person that actually knows how to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus.
92,52,Do you think that's the joke? That's basically the same as what's happening.
95,52,"I don't think the government is the best at protecting the people, but it's kind of like ""The government has made up a story of what happened. I've been smothered in some of this nonsense for over a decade. I can't even imagine what a joke it is that I've done."""
100,52,"I'm not a doctor. But I would never try to get a sham to work or even get a job, and they'd tell me about the shams I tried to do at my house.

52,15,"Yes. I think the government is a bad idea. They've made up stories, but it seems to me they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it. It's the joke, not the problem."
52,16,I think that was pretty funny and that I can't help but laugh that you did something to stop the spread of AIDS and not give your mother a better reason to be afraid.
52,22,"If it was an actual joke that would stop it, then we'd probably not have a very serious issue with it - I'm still surprised that people don't want to hear that stuff and don't want to even think about it"

52,32,"We should not wear a mask, just wear one."
52,35,It is a joke that it isn't a joke and it isn't exactly an issue for people who are tasked with making it.

82,52,It's not a scam and it's not a scam. You have already been misinformed OP.
85,52,I don't think you get to choose between a person who has a mask for four times a day and one who doesn't.
87,52,Is there any way to know whether someone is going to go to the doctor?
90,52,That's why the government is such a bad idea.
92,52,"I just read your username and think it's a scam. It is not. I mean, I'm sure he's telling a funny story, but I think it's also not a scam. It's a scam."
95,52,I've heard it said in one of the interviews that he said it could be a good idea for people to go to the CDC and get screened.
100,52,"I think that the best masks are the ones that work best, but the ones that don't work well."

52,14,This isn't a joke. It's an argument.
52,15,CANNOTANSWER: I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone.
52,16,CANNOTANSWER: I would rather be able to wear a mask while I'm trying to protect myself.
52,22,So you're being sexist?
52,24,It's actually a fake joke that hasn't happened since the AIDS epidemic began.
52,29,This is how we use jokes like these in the real world.
52,30,You aren't being sexist. You are not making fun of your actions.
52,31,CANNOTANSWER:
52,32,"Why do you think it's a scam? You're lying, and I think the joke isn't what it is."
52,35,"IANAL, but what is the reason the government keeps using it?"

52,39,"CANNOTANSWER: I would rather be able to wear a mask while I'm trying to protect myself. I like how the person who has to wear a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people. Well you're being sexist."

Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"
61,52,"The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone. They're used in some of the most difficult settings to detect a virus. If you do not want to try to stop it, then you should try to stop the infection."
82,52,"I think you're getting into something else with this. The only thing that I know is that I'm scared of my face, which is also what I wear to ward off the germs. It's not a fake. I'm afraid that I won't feel safer wearing a mask, so I have to be more careful not to get in any danger or be depressed. If the virus spreads, the only thing I know is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam or a fraud. That's"
85,52,"This cliche seems to be a lot more about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's actually a good idea, and it isn't an actual joke."
87,52,The US government wants to use people like Obama to stop the spread of the disease. They don't want to do that.
90,52,"It is not a good idea, but the government doesn't have any mandates to prevent or prevent a virus from getting spread. Vaccination isn't illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."
92,52,Vaccination is not a scam. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. I think you have a problem with that.
95,52,"I love my coach, and we always seem to take this joke to heart."
100,52,"Unless you have an AIDS diagnosis, it can be a very bad thing. If you have a AIDS diagnosis, there is a problem of a different type of HIV. That's not true, there is no one type of AIDS diagnosis. But that is a very different issue."

52,6,Why is a mask a joke? Then why are people in the White House willing to wear them because they think that they are better than the ones who think it is a joke?
52,8,The joke is a lot more about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's a good idea.
52,14,"""They said it was illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of a virus. Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"""
52,15,That isn't the point of any kind of vaccine. It is the point of most HIV preventive measures.
52,16,"The joke ""Wearing a mask"" is a joke about how ""The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone."
52,22,"""Shocking!"" ""Shocking!"""
52,24,"Trump, in order to prevent a virus that is potentially fatal to people in the United States, says ""We need to make sure that we aren't the people in the white house and not the other way around."""
52,29,"The government is trying to try to push people into a war of words to stop the spread of AIDS. If they go the way of a joke, they will end it."
52,30,Vaccination is not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. Vaccination is not illegal.
52,31,"Obama is a bad candidate, but this isn't what is happening in the real world. He's being used as a joke and is doing nothing wrong, and his point is not true."
52,32,"Obama has a history of being a scumbag. He said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not. His statement isn't a joke. It's a joke that the government hasn't used since the AIDS epidemic began."
52,35,That's a nice point about it being a fake joke that can't happen since the AIDS epidemic began. It's also a joke that doesn't really change the reality of the situation.
52,38,Is this a misunderstanding of the AIDS epidemic?
52,39,It's a joke about the government using masks.
52,43,The joke has to be a lot about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's actually a good idea.
61,52,"I'd have a hard time stopping it. I would probably get out the door if I were to say, ""Oh, I'm sorry that didn't work out for you, but I think it's better to let you get out of a job, because I'm not going to be able to avoid the other issues in your country that you guys need to get rid of."""
82,52,">You have already been misinformed OP."", ""I think you're getting into something else with this."
85,52,This is a joke. You lose a mask a lot and you are not going to be able to use it.
87,52,The AIDS government is trying to stop the spread of the disease. They don't want to do that. I think this is a good point. The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official.
90,52,It is not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
92,52,"In all seriousness, the CDC is not saying that this is a scam, because it tries to convince people to do it in the first place. It's just that it is a scam. I'm sorry if anyone got hurt in this but the CDC is wrong. The truth is that this is an AIDS scam. I think it is, but I'm not sure it's what it is."
95,52,"It is a great joke. It's good to know it's not a joke, but it's good to know that people are talking about a great joke. The guy who got the virus was the only one. I really enjoy playing hockey, and when I try to play a sport that's really good I can't stand the lack of a joke."
100,52,"I guess you have a good point about how in the middle of a song the government sneezes while being unknowingly exposed to the AIDS virus? Like ""You know what's more painful, I may want to try to see if I can get to sleep in a bed in the summer when I'm not at work."""
52,1,Obama endorsed a vaccine in a crowded congressional seat.
52,5,AIDS is an inflammatory disease. That is not a real threat to anyone. AIDS is not a real threat. It's an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
52,6,"It's a joke about a troll. He's not trying to make us laugh, and he's trying to make people laugh."
52,8,It's an AIDS scam.
52,14,It's not just a joke that the government is using to help stop the spread of a virus. The joke is not about this.
52,15,"CANNOTANSWER: I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone.', ""That isn't the point of any kind of vaccine. It is the point of most HIV preventive measures."
52,16,Obama is a troll because he was able to make a joke about the AIDS epidemic because he is a troll and he is trying to be a troll.
52,22,Obama's trolls are telling the truth.
52,24,"You can see the masks in the U.S., but you can see them everywhere. If a government can afford to do it and the government can afford to do it they aren't the ones in the White House. That's not why they are not in the White House - they are the ones in the White House."
52,29,"The government is trying to push people into a war of words to stop the spread of AIDS. If they go the way of a joke, they will end it."
52,30,In a lot of countries you can't just say that without it. Vaccination is illegal.
52,31,">The joke ""Wearing a mask"" is a joke about how ""The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone."
52,32,Is there a conspiracy to suggest that this is a fake joke?

52,38,What's the problem with this?
52,39,"""Is this a joke about the AIDS epidemic? It's a joke about the government using masks. The joke has to be a lot about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's actually a good idea."""
52,43,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children.''"
61,52,"I was told the same thing about my grandmother, who was in the office and threw up. And we said it was 'a big deal' to let her get out of her house and not to help anybody. And they said, 'You do not want to help people, but you can help them.'"
82,52,"I've been on this site for about 20 years, and have never had to tell anyone to wear a mask."
85,52,The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind and not actually the part that has to be made up.
87,52,AIDS is a cult of the tarot. It has become a cult of the tarot.
90,52,The government isn't going to enforce any mandates to prevent you from getting vaccinated. The CDC won't enforce them. The other one says:
92,52,The CDC is not saying this is a scam. It’s just that it’s a scam.
95,52,"It sounds like the CDC is working with him to prevent the spread of a virus, and they are making up a story. I can't get over it, just saying,"
100,52,A lot of people in this thread are saying that a mask prevents disease that has become widespread and that the government is using it to combat that disease.
52,1,"I think this is one of the things people have been saying in their post about the president, and that they have no need for him to use it."
52,5,Apparently it's a joke. It's a'smoking a joke'.
52,6,I don't think Obama lied in the first place. He made this up because it is not the point of any HIV vaccine. But now he's making the point of his own trolls.
52,8,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
52,14,"As a troll who's told the truth, what a nutjob."
52,15,"It's a joke, not the issue. It's a joke."
52,16,It's not a joke and it's not true. It's a nonsense and a lie. It's not a joke or a joke.
52,22,"I read that in the context of a post about Obama, and that the whole AIDS epidemic was being pushed up to the top by the president and that this is the wrong place to go, because the CDC is using a mask to prevent that."
52,24,"As an African American, I can say with certainty that we should wear a mask. Is a mask really going to prevent the spread of AIDS?"
52,29,The CDC is preventing the spread of AIDS.
52,30,I cant stand the jokes on this site.
52,31,"I think we've all figured out that people who haven't seen a mask on the radio, even when it hasn't been on, are a fake joke."
52,32,You are not in the White House.
52,35,I don't think it's that he was just pretending to be funny. It was a joke about what it could've done.
52,38,"I had a friend who was a doctor in NY. They would tell her that wearing a mask was illegal for anyone. She contacted her doctor, he said she was doing her research, and they didn't tell her this was illegal."
52,39,"""Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

82,52,">I’ve had a few dummy tarot cards. They actually were made out of people, and the more you know, the better thing is. It’s not a scam. The only thing I know is that I’m afraid that I won’t feel safer wearing a mask."
85,52,"They're not really looking for a real problem, just one part of a bigger problem. I mean, I know they can't say that. It's a problem because they can't say that's a problem because they don't think that it's. It's a problem because of the stigma that they keep using as a way of communicating that they're sick and can't help themselves, so they can't change their mind."
87,52,"""I think that the tarot card and the mask are both actually made of masks to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It isn't a tarot card."""
90,52,Vaccination isn't illegal. It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
92,52,It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.
95,52,"I'm the one who got the shit, it is definitely a joke."
100,52,"AIDS isn't a disease, it's a disease."
52,1,The word mask is actually an extremely misleading term.
52,5,"Vaccination isn't illegal, it's an effective method of preventing the spread of AIDS. It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections. It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections."
52,6,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. I have seen several videos containing the quote: ""You have to be under a protective hood to get on the air to get out of the door."""
52,8,Obama is a racist. He is a racist. He is a racist.
52,14,No. If the government could stop people from wearing a mask they'd want to do something illegal.
52,15,"I think that you have done something wrong. If someone wears a mask, they're going to want to protect themselves or the public."
52,16,">It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s not a joke, not a joke or a joke."
52,22,"I'm just going to say that if it was an actual joke that would stop it, then we'd probably not have a very serious issue with it."
52,24,What are you doing here? It's getting a lot worse than you think and you need to go to the doctor's office if you want to keep the infection at bay.
52,29,"...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke."
52,30,Vaccination is illegal. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
52,31,"Because a bunch of dummy tarot cards are based off the actual AIDS epidemic. So it doesn't surprise me, because I can say that's an accurate statement based on what happened here."
52,32,"AIDS isn't an issue, it's a disease. It is a problem because it's a disease."
52,35,"A good thing, though, is the guy who was a doctor who was not a doctor, has a history of saying such ridiculous things."
52,38,"You say it is a joke, don't tell it."
52,39,"I think I have to start getting sick from wearing the mask, but I'm the one who got a mask."

85,52,">I lost my face because I wore a mask for work, and I had no choice but to keep it on because I lost some flies, and the first time I tried to use a mask, it was because of cold, wind."
87,52,The other people stating that 'AIDS is a cult of the tarot' aren't Americans.
90,52,I think they're a little naive to think that there isn't a mandate to prevent people from getting vaccinated. That's why they're a big government organization.
92,52,"I can understand why people are saying this, but this is just an unpopular opinion. I'm not saying that this isn't a scam, but it does sound like they're misusing an actual diagnosis to get rid of HIV-related infections."
95,52,The government has done the right thing. This is why the games are canceled and I do not like to go and have sex.
100,52,"Yes, I agree with your last line."
52,1,I don't know how it would sound to me if I said the other guy didn't know better.
52,5,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.
52,6,Vaccination is illegal. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Because a bunch of dummy tarot cards are based off the actual AIDS epidemic.
52,8,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
52,14,The government is doing this because they owe it to the people.
52,15,AIDS is not a virus. HIV/AIDS is a disease. It's a problem because of the fact that people still wear masks to prevent the spread. It's a joke.
52,16,"He's talking to a man. He wants to tell the people who have an HIV infection, he wants them to protect themselves. He wants a public safety demonstration for how he's doing it."
52,22,Vaccination is illegal. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
52,24,"A lot of things have been a joke for a long time. You don't like it, but you do like it."
52,29,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
52,30,Is there anything wrong with it?
52,31,I don't like the slur...
52,32,I am so glad this is not a joke. This is the first time I have heard this.
52,35,This is why I don't like to go and have sex.
52,38,Because the NSA was being incredibly honest with people claiming that the CDC was the CDC?
52,39,This is why the games are canceled and I do not like to go and have sex.
52,43,"The US has done the right thing, because they aren't even remotely Americans, so it's only logical that a few Americans are saying that a hive mind could be a hive mind. It's a funny joke, to have a human face. But it doesn't sound like a joke to them."
61,52,This is a really good question. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,52,CANNOTANSWER:
85,52,"So why is a ""prank"" like that not a joke? Because it's so tame to try to make them think the same way. It doesn't make any sense, it just makes them think the other way around."
87,52,The AIDS government has become a cult of the tarot. It's not a good thing the US government is trying to stop.
90,52,This is just one example of what the US government is an awful organization. They are a very large part of government spending.
92,52,I believe that some of the people in the comments are saying that you do not really need a doctor to vaccinate you.
95,52,"My mom did this on the radio, and she's a bit of a douche."
100,52,"I think the only time that people aren't aware of the problem is when people are adamant that AIDS is not a disease, because it isn't a disease and it isn't an epidemic. I think you're being very harsh, you sound like you've taken the wrong kind of time."
52,1,"I'm assuming the phrase ""why does the word mask sound misleading?"" is actually incorrect, and it's just a joke, or something along those lines. I don't have any good advice."
52,5,"Vaccination is a joke because you can still have HIV or have an infection, if that's the way you do it."
52,6,I don't know if you can find the slur. But that's a joke.
52,8,I think a lot of people in the comments are saying that the US government has become a cult of the tarot.
52,14,A few of these lines have been in r/reality a few times.
52,15,They're not gonna help you and you aren't getting sick because they aren't wearing a mask.
52,16,This is all a sexist slur.
52,22,I would like to ask why the US government is so good at it.
52,24,"Vaccination is illegal. AIDS is a disease. It's a problem because of the fact that people still wear masks to prevent the spread. It's a joke. The US has done the right thing, because they aren't even remotely Americans, so it's only logical that a few Americans are saying that a hive mind could be a hive mind. It's a funny joke, to have a human face."
52,29,"He was in the interview with a woman who was the spokesperson for the CDC on a piece of tarot, despite being a huge tarot follower."
52,30,"I mean, I've never seen this. I see the slurs on the site, but I don't see what they're trying to say about vaccinations. The thing is, there is a lot of discussion about why people adamant the AIDS government is not a disease or an epidemic."
52,31,"You've got to keep your mouth shut, you have to keep your mouth shut. I'm not gonna get off on this but I've got to stop it!"
52,32,"Obama has a history of being a scumbag. He said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not. Obama has said it's illegal to wear a mask in a state, but in some countries they do not. His statement isn't a joke."
52,35,A big part of the joke is that he is an evil hive mind and he is telling a joke.
52,38,The CDC is a good organization despite all of these ridiculous excuses for what is going on. A lot of the ridiculous things are not a joke. The CDC is an awful organization and a cult of the tarot.
52,39,"I love Obama and the idea of his pranks being funny and not making it a joke is a shame, but I think Trump's idea of the AIDS epidemic is probably pretty sexist, and a bit jarring."
52,43,>I think the first thing you noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind and not actually the part that has to be made up.
61,52,A really good question. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,52,I would be very upset if someone were to say this as a joke. I don't know what they are going to do to get people to be sick. I think the problem is that the CDC is trying to cover up a situation like this.
85,52,"I think you can read more about what a mask actually does to people. A narcissist, with a mask on, isn't getting government attention."
87,52,I think it would be a very good idea for the tarot card and the mask to be made of in order to stop the spread of AIDS.
90,52,That is a good thing that is what we need to know.
92,52,I have a friend that is currently in the middle of a fight with HIV and they want to get him vaccinated. He has no proof of that.
95,52,I’m not going to tell you what I really like to tell you about this nonsense.
100,52,"I believe that this has to do with the fact that it is not a disease, but the fact that it is an epidemic and it's a disease. There is a whole bunch of sneeze and sneeze at once. You can't change the mask."
52,1,The CDC is a sexist cult of the tarot. I'm very sorry that they're trying to cover up the fact that the CDC has been running in their circles for a while.
52,5,"AIDS isn't a disease, it's an epidemic. It's an inflammatory disease."
52,6,"So, I don't know what a joke is? What's the slur, I'm not sure if a joke is a joke or not? What's the joke? What is it?"
52,8,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
52,14,"It's a prank, not a joke."
52,15,I read a couple of comments and then I got an email telling people that the guy who said the joke wasn't a hive mind and the question isn't why he chose to wear a mask.
52,16,You can't change the mask if you don't have a mask on. That doesn't exist. Vaccination isn't a health issue.
52,22,I see the trolls are telling the truth. I think this is just a joke.
52,24,That's one of the most basic ideas I've heard in a while. But...
52,29,"AIDS is a virus. A virus. A disease. A virus. A virus. A virus. AIDS is not a disease. It's a problem because of the fact that people still wear masks to prevent the spread. '...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke.' '...which is not actually true in this case, it is just a joke.'"

52,31,Vaccination is illegal. It's a problem because people still wear masks to prevent the spread. It's a joke.
52,32,I'm a huge Obama supporter and a friend of the president's. I hated him and hated him because of his sexism and his hatred for the CDC.
52,35,The fact that his point of view about AIDS is a joke that isn't a joke and that the CDC has used the tarot to create a hive mind that is not a hive mind is an absolute awesin.
52,38,There is a big difference between a hive mind being a joke and a hive mind being a joke. And then there's that. And then there's the problem of people not wanting to get vaccinated.
52,39,"AIDS is a disease. People still wear AIDS masks to prevent it, and while it is a terrible idea, it can be really helpful to people."
52,43,I'm not going to tell you what I really like to tell you about this nonsense.
61,52,I am so confused by the last line.
82,52,The government is trying to get people to be sick by covering up this stuff.
85,52,Because a person who isn't a person who has a phobia of flying flies and doesn't know how to manage that phobia is not a narcissist.
87,52,Then why is it so hard to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic? The truth is not real.
90,52,I think we have already got a good idea here.
92,52,"""At a young age, a person in this world is a fraud to their credit. The best thing you can do is tell me I do not want to get vaccinated. I want to be able to get rid of it. I do not want to have to get my medical stuff off the market."""
95,52,It’s not really funny. It is a joke. I think the problem isn’t the mask. It’s how the government treats people.
100,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,1,I'm not really into trolls.
52,5,Vaccination isn't illegal. It's an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
52,6,There is a joke about getting a dummy tarot card.
52,8,This is how you describe AIDS.
52,14,"They owe the people. This is a joke, the jokes are fake."
52,15,"""...which isn't actually true in this case, it is just a joke. I think they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it. It's the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone."""
52,16,Vaccination isn't a health issue.
52,22,"The only problem is that we are still trying to stop the spread of this disease. I've seen stories on Twitter about people who have had cancer in their lives, including some who've been treated for it, who may have been treated in a different manner than everyone else because of the HIV epidemic."
52,24,"You're trying to explain the hive mind joke, because it's actually a joke."
52,29,It's not funny. It's a joke.
52,30,I feel the same way about the other commenters.
52,31,A lot of people like to wear masks.
52,32,It's not even a joke that the Obama White House is making the right choice here.
52,35,The people who don't want to get vaccinated are also ignorant of the facts of their lives. There's no way this could be true.
52,38,I think the CDC should stop trying to delegitimize his government policy. It is one of the things the president should have done.
52,39,The whole joke is absurd and misleading.
52,43,"I read this and was like, ""Fresh fuck me and I'm going to keep up the nonsense!"""
61,52,I believe you need to get some self-confidence work done in the US to stop the spread of HIV and preventing other types of infections.
82,52,I agree. You shouldn't have a tarot card. Having a tarot card is so important to you.
85,52,No one knows what phobia is or what exactly it is.
87,52,People who try to use tarot cards are just as ignorant of their problems as a lot of other folk.
90,52,The CDC has a mandate on vaccinations. But they won't enforce them. They're a very large part of government spending.
92,52,"Vaccination is not a scam. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. I'm sorry that you were going through this, but I'm not sure what it is. The CDC is making it sound like it is a scam."
95,52,I am going to go ahead and call this a joke.
100,52,"AIDS is a disease. 'Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it isn't an epidemic and it's a disease.',"
52,1,Is it really a joke? Why would anyone have an issue unless someone endorsed a vaccine?
52,5,What do you think of the CDC? They are going to have to do more to keep the people from wearing it.
52,6,I don't want to talk to you.
52,8,This is one of the most twisted and twisted things I have ever heard.
52,14,"""Well, I do wear a mask now, but I don't want to do it again. I am trying to do it now. It's the only thing I can do to stop it from happening."
52,15,"I feel the same way about the other commenters. I read this and was like, ""Fresh fuck me and I'm going to keep up the nonsense!"""
52,16,Vaccination isn't a health issue.
52,22,"Is it possible that the Obama administration is just trying to push a bill on the spread of the virus, which isn't actually true?"
52,24,I'd rather be able to wear my mask than be able to have my AIDS gone.
52,29,"A hive mind joke, not a joke."
52,30,"Vaccination isn't a disease. It's a serious issue. You don't need a mask, and a mask is not even a health issue. That's the point."
52,31,Vaccination is a problem because people still wear masks to prevent the spread. It's a joke.
52,32,"I'm just glad he was able to use his tarot card, because it's not one of the more popular cards."
52,35,I'm really glad someone responded.
52,38,"""You say it is a joke, don't tell it."""
52,39,The CDC is trying to delegitimize Obama's health policy.
52,43,"""I think they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it. It's the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone."""
61,52,"CANNOTANSWER, my co-worker, also got some tarot cards for the CDC about the spread of HIV/AIDS. Essentially, this is one of them."
82,52,"As a doctor, I would have to tell my friend that if he would have an actual tarot card, I wouldn't be able to see my face. But I'm afraid if I were to say this, he would have already been misinformed."
85,52,He was referring to how people are afraid of flying flies.
87,52,It's not the actual tarot that says it's not a tarot. The fake tarot is just a fake tarot card that says it's a tarot card and is misleading.
90,52,"I am not sure what the meaning is of it. Vaccination isn't illegal. It's not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."","
92,52,"Vaccination is not a scam, it is a scam because it's a really serious disease and doesn't really affect the actual virus's growth, even though it has been shown to be effective. You'll be vaccinated."
95,52,"I don't know how it has ever been so common that a hockey team that doesn't wear a mask doesn't actually have the virus, but they still don't have the correct mask for this kind of thing?"
100,52,"They're basically trying to cut off public health funding, but the government isn't doing it because of what's being advertised. Honestly, they're doing it because they've seen this on television."
52,1,"As a medical student in the DC area, I have a mask. I also have a mask with some stickers on it."
52,5,"""We're the only people who do not want to wear a mask."""
52,6,Vaccination isn't an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Because a bunch of dummy tarot cards are based off the actual AIDS epidemic. It's not a joke.
52,8,"""The purpose of masks is not to prevent the spread of any illness but to protect my children"""
52,14,"So, the joke is over. Besides the rest of the jokes, there's a lot of stuff about the truth..."
52,15,"This shit ain't a joke, c'mon. You don't need a mask to protect yourself, or your children."
52,16,I'm pretty sure this was just a joke to fuck off a few months ago.
52,22,"Ingraham's mask isn't a real thing, and I've no idea why anyone would ever wear it"
52,24,I just read the first sentence of the link and thought it was pretty great. It is a bit misleading that it is a hive mind joke that doesn't work for all Americans.
52,29,"Honestly, I think Obama is a huge fan of all of the things you said, but in any case, I'm pretty sure this is one of the most disturbing things to happen in a man's life, and I think he might have some other problem:"

52,31,You've got a bad friend.
52,32,I think Obama's tarot card is a joke.
52,35,"The whole of this has been on the news for a long time. People are being lied to, and some people are being misinformed."
52,38,A good way to prevent the spread of AIDS is to tell the CDC that there are a number of very serious public health issues.

85,52,"The guy was not interested in the whole thing. That he was referring to the fact that the person he referred to is a hive mind. The joke was about the fact that people have phobias, they can’t seem to understand it. It’s a joke and the way people think about it can be used to justify their own phobia. A phobia that can cause harm is not a joke, but one that is a joke. It isn’t a joke because it is a joke. The CDC doesn’t think that."
87,52,"I don't think this is a good point, but a bit of the sarcasm part is going to make me laugh."

52,24,I want to take you over to the US government website where you're talking about the ridiculousness and dread of Obama wearing a mask. It's a joke that I think should not be taken seriously by any one on r/americans or r/no-fap
52,29,"You can't say it's not funny. It's a joke, despite its content."

52,29,So I'm a guy with a phobia of Obama. I don't want to get vaccinated. I want to have a hive mind. This is a joke.
52,30,I've viewed it as a joke but I've never seen it in person. I've seen it before in an interview and heard a few times.
52,31,This is a prank. It's a joke. The CDC has a monopoly over the internet.
52,32,Is this a prank?
52,35,I read the comments on both sides of this thread.
52,38, (Recommended to the CDC for posting to r/nofap for the entire shit cycle.)](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap/dmg_htm/r/nofap_chapter/html/r/r/nofap_chapter/index.html). Is Obama wearing a mask a joke?
52,39,"I like how the guy who gets sick from wearing a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people."
52,43,>Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system?
61,52,I like that the CDC is getting into the habit of buying tarot cards on the internet.
82,52,This is a very serious ad. It has the potential to be a very effective way to control the spread of the disease. You don't have to be a doctor to get a tarot card. It isn't a scam. It is trying to deter people from getting vaccinated. It is also not a scam.
85,52,I just wanted to say that I was a little weird when I read the title: I'm not a prick. I have a phobia.
87,52,"I have never read that quote before and this is probably a bit of a cliche. But I do like the tarot cards because I see them being sarcastic about the actual truth. I feel that if a person doesn't believe in a tarot, it's probably too easy to believe and the joke is inherently a lie. So I guess that's a valid and legitimate point to make."
90,52,"I'm sorry that I'm not on the same page about this topic, but the whole thing is fucked up. It seems like it's a joke."
92,52,I can't believe you're in the same boat as the CDC.
95,52,"It's a joke and I'm gonna call it a joke, and then try to go 'Fuck the government' when the government actually does the right thing."
100,52,"AIDS is a disease. It's not a disease, it's a disease."
52,1,It's really a joke. It isn't a joke.
52,5,I read this in a book called Is Obama wearing a mask a joke?
52,6,a lot of tarot cards are based off the actual HIV epidemic.

52,24,"I feel like a prick and a bit of a jerk, but for the most part the people who're just trying to do the right thing aren't being honest and being honest and telling the truth."
52,29,I can't say that the joke is a joke. This guy is being called a liar. ''They said it is illegal to wear a mask in a state in order to stop the spread of a virus.''
52,30,>The CDC has a monopoly over the internet.
52,31,Vaccination is illegal. It's a joke because people are still being billed as a prick in order to spread it. It's a joke because people have been harmed by AIDS.
52,32,The CDC is buying tarot cards from a bunch of different sources. There isn't a consensus on whether it's a prank.
52,35,>Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system?
52,38,I don't think it's a joke because the CDC has a monopoly over the internet. I just don't believe it.
52,39,It's a joke. That's why it comes up on r/nofap.
52,43,It's also a prank because a lot of people want to be vaccinated from wearing a mask.
61,52,"The NSA is the government of today, a real gov't agency."
82,52,I’d like to read the tarot deck and the story.
85,52,"I was talking about the part of phobias which was made up by people with phobias and people are talking about how they are trying to fool people into thinking they have a phobia. I was wondering why people were thinking that this is a joke, and what a phobia."
87,52,And a good point is that wearing the tarot card is a pity for the president. ''Then why is it so hard to stop the spread of the disease? The truth is not real.''
90,52,I'm sorry but your point has been misplaced.
92,52,"Vaccination is a scam, because it doesn't really affect the virus's growth, even though it has been shown to be effective. It's one of the very few illnesses that we can prevent and prevent. The CDC is trying to convince people to do it. This is just a scam."
95,52,"The movie is a joke. If it is a joke that it is a joke, then it should be. You should check it out."

52,24,The most important thing is the fact that the person who has to wear a mask has to wear a mask. If he isn't comfortable with it he shouldn't be on the job or not.
52,29,"I'm not sure where you are going with that, but it's kind of creepy IMO."
52,30,Vaccination is not a disease. It is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
52,31,"The joke doesn't even make any sense: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't think it's a joke because the CDC has a monopoly over the internet."""
52,32,"It's a joke. I'm a huge Obama supporter and a friend of the president's. I hated him and hated him because of his sexist sexism and hatred for the CDC. I’m just glad that he was able to use his tarot card, because it's not one of the more popular cards. I’m just glad it's not a joke."
52,35,I feel like I'm the only one who's a prick. And you?
52,38,Are you saying that this is a joke because it was a joke?
52,39,It’s a joke because it makes you question whether a prank is a joke or not.
52,43,"I'm pretty sure that the CDC and the CDC have not gotten together yet, but the people that voted are likely to have already taken care of it. The whole thing is not a joke."
61,52,"In this case, the whole article is basically a conspiracy theory. They don't believe in the existence of a false intelligence report (they believe there are no legitimate credible sources for it) and they believe the NSA has a monopoly over the Internet."
82,52,"A lot of people who tarot cards are fake, and the CDC is trying to cover everything up."
85,52,"It sounds like the CDC, if they don't really want to know what that is, is really a joke."

82,52,It's a scam if you get sick of it. It's the worst if you aren't in good health. It's not like the best if you get sick of it because it can be really invasive. Vaccination is a scam. They're scammers because they don't know what they're going to do to stop people from being raped. It's a scam.

52,22,"They're not trying to stop the spread of AIDS, they're trying to stop it. The CDC doesn't even use the name AIDS, its just a rumor."
52,24,A friend of mine recently grew up in a hospital and had an AIDS virus and was told by his boss that it wasn't a joke. He threw the whole thing off as well.
52,29,"A lot of people are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. I think people need to think of the real numbness of AIDS, or I think if you don't have any idea what it is you might just be misinformed."

87,52,People who do things like this are going to think of a tarot card as a joke.
90,52,"That's exactly how you said it. The CDC is using a meme for a reason. Besides, they have no mandates to prevent people from getting vaccines and the CDC doesn't."
92,52,This is a very real issue. I think a lot of the people who are trying to get vaccines are not in the right minds to do this.

90,52,I have no idea why you are downvoting me...
92,52,What you have said about these scams is very interesting. There's so much in it that the only people that can't be convinced are those who want to be vaccinated. The ones who are not.
95,52,"In the film ""The one and only"" they try to make up a story about the government's handling of the CDC's mask a couple of times, and a couple of times it just pops into my head. It's pretty funny and some of it is a bit funny. But I think the jokes aren't really funny and you're right it's a joke. Despite some of them being laughable, there are no actual jokes."
100,52,"Apparently, they're trying to stop the spread of AIDS by using a mask that's a joke."
52,1,There is a lot of material pointing out that it's part of the government's plan to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

52,32,This is a joke. It's a joke.
52,35,Those are the simplest jokes of all. They're just silly.
52,38,It's not a joke. The CDC is an awful organization and a cult of the tarot.
52,39,I think it's pretty hilarious.
52,43,... I thought it was weird that people were downvoting me.
61,52,"I don't really know what the big deal is here: The CDC's not doing anything to help the CDC, their own programs are being hijacked. They have a monopoly on the internet. The fact that this supposedly is a fake ad carries a serious risk of being a prankster, which they are trying to promote."
82,52,"If I were you, I would have a bad habit of talking to people I didn't know about. I would feel like I was making a joke or something. I wouldn't even be in any danger."
85,52,It seems like the CDC is making the cliche in the first place. It is probably trying to bring attention to this situation and is not a joke at all. I can see why people are putting on a mask for the sake of getting people to believe what it says or to use it to make them believe it.
87,52,It's an interesting and interesting article.
90,52,I am a bit jaded.
92,52,"I'm sure the CDC understands that you have a huge problem with this and doesn't have the resources to know what you're talking about. The article also explains how HIV is not a vaccinated disease and its spread is a really serious illness. The CDC does believe it is a vaccinated disease, but hasn't found that there is any actual reason to take advantage of it."
95,52,What is the point of an official not wearing a mask?
100,52,"A few hours ago I came across this song in a pubic satire called ""The one and only""."
52,1,"If this was a joke, why would we be trying to hide our truth from you, or the American people?"
52,5,"I'm not the joke person that wrote this, but there is no 'just a joke' on the internet or in the mainstream media. There's a very big difference between a joke and a satire, because you've been a joke for a while."
52,6,The thing that has been so sexist in a few weeks that it seems like people are getting upvotes for it is that it's all very good stuff and they're able to bring the truth into it without the joke being a joke.
52,8,"Well, if they're doing anything to stop the spread of the virus they should probably stop promoting them because it carries a significant risk of infection."
52,14,What is the joke about? What is the point of someone who does not know the truth about AIDS? The CDC has a monopoly of the internet.
52,15,The joke itself was made to have the same effect as what it was intended. This is a joke.
52,16,That's pretty funny. It's funny that this is the story that was written as a joke.
52,22,"That's very, very, stupid. I'm assuming that there is an actual real way to stop the spread of AIDS."
52,24,The problem isn't that you're wearing a mask because you aren't comfortable with it. It's that you're uncomfortable with it because you can't get any comfort out of it.
52,29,"So, the guy who said, ""Hmmmm, yes, you can wear a mask on a piece of tarot, despite not knowing what it says"", is using the CDC tarot ad to hush up Obama?"
52,30,">Is there anything wrong with it?', ""I mean, I've seen the slurs on the site, but I don't see what they're trying to say about it. It’s a joke."
52,31,I don't think they have a chance to make a joke about a real sexist thing. But I don't think it's any worse than being a sexist joke about the issue in general.
52,32,"""The Obama cloak has been invented. It's not a joke. It's just a joke."

87,52,"""If you don't want to die of the disease, you need a tarot card."""
90,52,It sounds to me like the government is trying to force people to get vaccinated - but the CDC is a big part of that and they aren't.

52,30,"As someone who has lived with this guy for years, I don't see this as a joke, but I would imagine he's just being sexist."
52,31,Why does someone who doesn't like wearing a mask want to hush up Obama?
52,32,And this is the first tarot card I've ever seen that was used by a prankster in a thread.
52,35,I feel like the government has been deluding us from the truth. You guys are making so much of an attempt at something else. This is about the CDC. It's just the government.

82,52,It is not a scam. The CDC is trying to make it clear that it is a scam. It is trying to deter people from getting vaccinated.
85,52,I guess the question is: What did he say?
87,52,"''If I didn't want to die of the disease, you need a tarot card.'''"
90,52,It's not a meme. It's an ACA mandate. If they aren't going to enforce them they won't.
92,52,The truth is that Vaccination is actually a scam. The truth is it’s a scam because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus. AIDS is. It’s not a virus. It’s not a virus. It’s not a virus. But it’s not a virus. Vaccination is a scam because it’s not a virus.

82,52,It's a scam. The government is trying to make it clear that it's not a scam.
85,52,People need to see the world the way they can and that it's an acceptable method of handling a phobia.
87,52,You can take it up with a bunch of other tarot decks.
90,52,CDC is using the meme to do some illegal things. There's no mandate that it's illegal or that it's effective. You're not going to be able to tell a lot of people what a vaccine is.

52,1,"The CDC is a cult, not a sexist cult. You can read a lot of stuff on them, but I have no clue what you're talking about here."
52,5,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.

61,52,It's also a joke.
82,52,CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer and author of the book It's a scam because they are trying to make it clear that it's not a scam.
85,52,I don't think the CDC can really change the way they talk.
87,52,I just wanted to chime in on some of the jokes of this entire thread.
90,52,The government is not a joke. The CDC has a mandate to prevent AIDS. This is an ACA mandate.
92,52,Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you're not going to have a virus.
95,52,"This is a joke about the government, not the government."
100,52,"AIDS is not a disease, it is an epidemic. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It's so depressing that you can't understand why people have a problem with it. I think the people who are trying to laugh about this aren't the people who are complaining."
52,1,"A doctor who endorsed the vaccine at the congressman's house because of the number of people he's with had been sick without them, has to go to a doctor and get his ass in hand if he's not doing this. So he must be taking the wrong kind of medicine for the hysterical jokes."
52,5,"It was all about the President being the only one who sucked the joke out of the people, and it wasn't only about the government but also about avoiding the spread of AIDS."
52,6,"I think you need to understand that the word'mako', which means'mako' in the meaning, is meant to refer to a piece of writing or a text that is based on an actual word."
52,8,AIDS is an epidemic. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans.
52,14,"No slack is allowed and that's not why you don't talk about it. No matter how you feel, the point of your speech is not to give a fuck."
52,15,"The jokes that are made are a bit off. Among others, I don't really think I'd like to say, 'If I'm the only person who is not wearing a mask', but I think that the way this is going is pretty much a joke."
52,16,"I can understand the pain you are feeling a little bit but I think there is nothing I can do. I'm not sure that I'd go through the mental gymnastic slurs, I don't see why that can't be avoided. I want a healthy person to die from HIV. I do know that it is hard to understand. I think it's a cliche to make a joke about someone without a mask. But to me that sounds too ridiculous for a person to be able to explain a joke and a joke that someone else is "
52,22,Vaccination is not a joke.
52,24,"The reason it's a joke is because they aren't telling the whole story (I'm not saying it's a joke, but I don't think they're telling it in any way besides they just want to laugh at you, but if they're making a joke they're making a joke. So they're not trying to be funny?"
52,29,I don't think a person hating a President is a dick. If a government guy says something like that he's going to resign from office.
52,30,The CDC is trying to tell the truth and it's going to do so for the next 10 years. You can't force the government to stop all those things.
52,31,"Unless you're defending it as a joke, there isn't really a point in trying to avoid it."
52,32,There's no real reason to be a comedian. This is not a joke.
52,35,"The CDC has a mandate to prevent AIDS. It is an ACA mandate. Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you are not going to have a virus. This is a joke about the government, not the government."
52,38,"I think the best way to deal with this is to just say, 'I can't believe the CDC isn't doing its job'"
52,39,"I can't find this one but I’m reading from the context of what you have just said. The whole joke is ridiculous, and the idea that it makes people question whether it’s a joke is absolutely ridiculous. The idea that the people have to wear masks in order to get vaccinated is a huge waste of time and money."
52,43,"'I am in this place too, and I’m not going to give a fuck. I’m not going to give a fuck."
61,52,"I'm a doctor, and I've never gotten a bronchitis... I think I don't have any idea of what it is and I can't tell what's causing the infection."
82,52,"""I feel like it’s going to be easy to tell people if I don’t wear a mask. I would be very upset if someone told me it was fake, but they said it was not."""
85,52,It's pretty obvious that the CDC isn't aware of what it does. It is clearly not trying to change the way they talk.
87,52,And that's not how you say it:
90,52,"> I am not sure why you are downvoting me...', 'I am a bit jaded.', 'I feel a lot of people don't even understand the word ""middle school"" and their views on it."
92,52,I'm not really sure why the article is in this niche.
95,52,The CDC is working on a joke about a virus.
100,52,AIDS isn't a disease. HIV is a disease. HIV is a disease. AIDS is an epidemic. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans. It affects millions of Americans.
52,1,No. The President's mask is not part of the measures deployed by the CDC to stop the spread of AIDS.
52,5,"Vaccination is a joke because you can't even have a healthy person or have a healthy person dying from HIV, and you're not even going to be able to even get vaccinated from a doctor."
52,6,Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of AIDS. Because a bunch of dummy tarot cards are based off the actual AIDS epidemic. It's not a joke. The CDC is buying tarot cards from a bunch of different sources. There isn't a consensus on whether it's a joke or not?
52,8,"I have a problem with people being irritated at the idea of using a mask to protect their children. So I'm not saying the idea is a joke, but it's a joke. >I think it's a joke because it makes people think that it's funny - like, I mean, because I don't like the way people say it, but I'm getting a little philosophical. I've got a feeling that's what's going on here."
52,14,It's not a joke.
52,15,"If it's a joke, it's a joke."
52,16,"Vaccination is an issue, but is also not a health issue."
52,22,"This is so confusing. ""Female AIDS is actually not a disease. We're bringing that issue into the country because we don't want this to get worse."""
52,24,This is a joke that they're proving. They reeeally need to get back to a level playing field with people who will never understand the true meaning of the word.
52,29,"Despite what they say, Obama is making a joke about that."
52,30,This is a ridiculous joke.
52,31,If people don't like Vaccination they don't want to be a joke about the issue.
52,32,The entire post is very sad. I can't even read the headline correctly. The CDC is using these jokes on people not in the US.
52,35,They are going to do their job and go after people who don't get vaccinated.
52,38,"The CDC has a mandate to prevent AIDS, but its mandate is not to tell the whole story."
52,39,If you're really worried about it you're probably thinking about what's going on and if you think you might like it.
52,43,"You know, to me, it is a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. The jokes that are made are a bit off. Among others, I don't really think I'd like to say, 'If I'm the only person who is not wearing a mask, but I think that the way this is going is pretty much a joke."
61,52,"a lot of this is coming from [normative](http://www.normative.org/), which is the site for the US government"
82,52,It's a very serious ad. It has the potential to be a very effective way to control the spread of a virus. You don't have to be a doctor to get a tarot deck.
85,52,It's a joke. But it's also not a joke.
87,52,"> ""The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official."", ""Isn't that all he wants to do?"""
90,52,"If you look at this post as a story about a person who's dying of a virus, there are two scenarios in which the CDC is the main source. The first is the message that you're comparing it to an actual person who died because of an actual vaccine. The second is the message that the government is a big government organization."
92,52,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. It was a very long, hard day, and I have to say that I'm very much a little disappointed in you. Thank you for expressing the fact that you are so incredibly unpopular with me. Please stop arousing this shit, please. It's a very sad day, and it will certainly be a huge burden. It is an issue that is becoming more and more urgent, and I don't want to be able to keep you up at night. I just want you to know the truth"
95,52,There's a few jokes:
100,52,"I think this is the joke that gets a lot of dick points, I don't care why people are sick. It’s really depressing."
52,1,The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official.
52,5,AIDS is not an inflammatory disease. It's a threat to everyone. It is an inflammatory disease. The problem is not with a mask it is with a mask.
52,6,"Unless tarot cards are the real thing, and they aren't in a way to save the lives of innocent people, then yes, it is a joke."
52,8,"Vaccination isn't a virus, it's an anti - HIV pill and you can't use that to make a joke about the problem. The government isn't trying to stop the spread of the virus and the government is attempting to make it worse."
52,14,Vaccination is an issue. Vaccination is not a health issue.
52,15,CANNOTANSWER: I'm very sorry you're going through this. I'm really sorry you're going through this. I'm really sorry that the CDC is a big government organization.

52,32,The headline is confusing and misleading. The CDC is trying to discredit Trump and his tarot cards and the CDC is trying to censor them so they can avoid being a joke.
52,35,"AIDS is a disease, not a disease. I’m sorry this happened to you."
52,38,Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke.
52,39,I just read the headline on the CDC website...
52,43,"I would love to read a doctor's note on this, because it's the most hilarious shit I have ever read."
61,52,What the fuck is the point of a tarot card?
82,52,"""[Lexico] - I'm just gonna let you know this is one of the top 10 tarot cards I have ever bought. This is my favorite thing to ever purchase and it's pretty funny."
85,52,"I grew up with a lot of phobias, and as a result wore a mask for several years. My mom and I lost my face because we didn't know if it was a joke. I was scared. So, I wore a mask for several years."
87,52,I'm not sure what's up with the tarot card. I just feel like he's trying to give a false statement about something.
90,52,"I'm a politician, and the word you used to describe me and a lot of others isn't in the title."
92,52,"I don't think the article is really about ""the CDC trying to convince people to do it because of the CDC's misleading statements. The truth is that it is not a scam because of the CDC's misguided claims and the FDA doesn't have the resources to know what it is."
95,52,"CANNOTANSWER said that a lot of these jokes aren't about the government, but the government is."
100,52,I was gonna say that if you don’t wear a mask you have to go to a doctor. Because that’s how the disease is spread and a mask prevents it is actually good advice. The best is that it keeps the sneezes down and the sneezes don’t get on your throat. That is how it works. I’d recommend it to everyone.
52,1,"I think the whole point is to protect public health, not to make it a joke. It's not a joke."
52,5,"There's a lot of people who suck their shit into a tarot card, and you're not going to get the information to make your life more difficult."
52,6,...I'm not a tarot card reader.
52,8,"Vaccination isn't a cult, but a joke."
52,14,I love the fact that the whole thing has been told multiple times by the CDC.
52,15,What a shame it took so long to make this one.
52,16,I just think the tarot card is a sexist joke. It’s a joke a lot of people are going through.
52,22,Is a mask a joke?
52,24,"I have seen the headline. When you read it, you are taking a page out of it."
52,29,"You were a Republican, not a Republican. And your tarot card is a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
52,30,"There's a lot of debate about whether the CDC is a legitimate threat to the public health system and not a legitimate threat to public health. But, you know, a lot of the people who are getting sick aren't in the US, so, if you think this is the point, then do not buy a tarot card."
52,31,Vaccination is a joke.
52,32,I can't believe this is from a website. I have never heard of the CDC claiming it is a joke. But it's really one of those things you can't believe.
52,35,"I’ve seen a few examples of this. One is an example of how one is made fun of and abused. The other is a great example of what the person who tarot cards are used to portray, as people get older and are more aware of how much of a joke this is. They aren’t being censored and they are promoting this shit."
52,38,"""I think it's a joke. It's a joke."""
52,39,Obama and the other Presidents will go to the government and get sick of this disease.
52,43,"A lot of people have said that a mask is an effective method to prevent the spread of a virus, despite being a joke."
61,52,They are also making use of fake ad networks. They are using a prank card to cover the internet's problems. They are not using fake ad networks to sway people into doing a prank. They are using fake ad networks to promote a fake ad campaign that only happens if they are actually using fake ad networks.

52,8,It's the best part of the entire thing. The fact that we have a public policy and can't make fun of the tarot is a logical and scientific explanation for a joke. We aren't in a position to make fun of the government. We can't make fun of the tarot. We can make fun of our politicians.

52,22,I don't get how the CDC doesn't use the word 'hive mind' for the vaccines.
52,24,"You should also note that the government has been invading many states, and I'm assuming there are some places where it's illegal to wear a mask."
52,29,"There is no cliche, and that's not a joke. If they didn't stop the spread of a virus, they would not have done anything."
52,30,I'm an AIDS/TB sufferer. I am trying to avoid the world's largest epidemic with my tarot card. If it is an epidemic I don't believe it's going to stop.
52,31,There is a joke about this.
52,32,I’m not sure why I’m not in the White House... Unless you guys are in the White House.
52,35,"The CDC has not responded to the jokes it was made. It is now, the CDC has not responded to them and it is censored."
52,38,Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's not a joke because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's a joke because it doesn't make the doctor feel bad about her. Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. It's a joke because it doesn't make the doctor feel bad about her. It's a joke because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus.
52,39,I know I will be a joker and I hope people stop using these jokes to get an idea of what is a joke.
52,43,"""The last one was, I didn't see it. I just noticed. I think this is the most snarky joke I've heard on here is ""[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
61,52,"""... [CanNOTANSWER] was my co-worker. I also got some tarot cards for the CDC."
82,52,I'm actually actually a doctor and a doctor who specializes in tarot. I'm assuming you're referring to the CDC as a fraud because if it's a scam it's just the tarot.
85,52,CANNOTANSWER: I would say this as an example of the CDC trying to get people to believe it is a joke. It’s a joke because it’s not a joke.
87,52,"So I would say: ""But it’s a scam because it’s a scam because it’s a scam because it’s a scam because it’s a scam because it’s a scam because it’s a scam."
90,52,I'm just pointing out the fact that the CDC is being a very large part of the government's spending. I would think they should consider using this meme to help stop people from getting sick.
92,52,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus. It’s not a virus because it’s not a virus.
95,52,It was really a great joke and you've got the right idea.
100,52,...But the government isn’t doing it because they believe that it’s a joke.
52,1,I don't think the joke is actually a joke.
52,5,I'm not a joke person and I don't like the humor.
52,6,"CANNOTANSWER: I think this is the most snarky joke I've heard on here is ""I'm actually actually actually a doctor and a doctor who specializes in tarot."""
52,8,"""Ingraham has said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."""
52,14,I just realized that a joke was in a thread.
52,15,The problem is that the government is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS unless it has a specific vaccine and a proper vaccine.
52,16,"he says 'Wearing a mask' is a joke, a joke and a joke is not a joke because it does not affect the spread of a virus"
52,22,"As an American with HIV/AIDS it is not a joke. I don’t know the real definition, but I would like to know more about this issue."
52,24,"I've heard people say it's a joke. I'm very, very sorry."
52,29,This isn’t a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus.
52,30,“They are trying to make a joke out of it. They are trying to make a joke out of it.”
52,31,I don't think it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't affect the spread of AIDS. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus.
52,32,Apparently this isn't just a joke.
52,35,"> 'I feel like I'm the only one who's a prick. And you?"","
52,38,"A lot of the jokes have been made out of self-centered humour. This one is a bit ad hominem, but I'm going to start with some really good ones - [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] ""'NAME"
52,39,"There is a huge difference between a joke and a joke. The idea is that the person is actually talking to the person who has to wear a mask, but not the person who wears a mask, despite the fact that it’s a joke, and the fact that it’s a joke to encourage people to be sick."
52,43,Vaccination is not a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus.
61,52,I can't really read the whole thing. It seems so snarky and I can't imagine what I would do if I told my family.
82,52,I gotta have a tarot card. I just bought a deck and I feel like I can put the card together without it being a scam.
85,52,"I would like to point out that, as a doctor, I cannot control my thoughts and my phobias. I am a phobia."
87,52,“The president is trying to stop the spread of the disease. They don’t want to do that. But I think it’s a good thing to stop. Because they are going to be trying to keep the spread of AIDS.”
90,52,I think that's very reasonable. I think there's a lot of problems that you mentioned that can be addressed by the government.
92,52,Then you'll have to find someone who's trying to get rid of a virus and find a doctor who actually works for them.
95,52,I love playing hockey. I can't stand the lack of a joke.
100,52,People are gonna make a joke on it. It’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke. But it’s a joke because it’s a joke.
52,1,You know the CDC is a cult.
52,5,"I'd say a lot of people are into jokes, but there's no way I'm talking about a lot of jokes in general."
52,6,They're actually a joke based off the actual virus. That's a joke.
52,8,I've had a lot of jokes in my life as a politician.. I don't think there's a way to make them better. It's just an idea and a funny idea.
52,14,"And the people who think it's a joke, are being jingoistic, and anti-semitic, and aren't really attracted to the people who think that it's a joke. I know what I'm saying, but I don't like the people who think it's a joke, and I know that's just what it is."
52,15,I grew up in a place where people in the CDC would wear a mask. I would have my first two kids on the day after I died.
52,16,It's really the only way we are going to be able to understand a joke. If you get sick and sick you can't get vaccinated.
52,22,I am just gonna go out on a limb and say: I am trying to stop the spread of AIDS and I want to stop it.

52,30,"It doesn't sound like they are trying to make a joke about the disease, it seems like they're trying to make a joke about a virus. It's a joke."
52,31,I think there are a lot of good ones here too.

52,35,"""A little while ago I read about a person who said it was ok not to wear a mask and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside."""
52,38,Isn't wearing a mask a joke?
52,39,This is really just a'shit joke' i'm sorry about but I'm going to put together some good ones ahh...
52,43,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus. It’s a joke because it’s not affect the growth of a virus.
61,52,It's not funny. It's just silly. It's the joke. It's a joke.
82,52,"As a result of this scam, the CDC is trying to sell a new tarot deck and not a new tarot. That is just the way a lot of people see it."
85,52,"I'm a doctor who wore a mask for several years because of a fear of flying flies, so I know that the reason people still don't think about it is because it's a joke."
87,52,I think the best thing you can do is ask people to get a deck of cards. That's all I can say about this.
90,52,I've made many comments here that I think are both misleading and very egregious.
92,52,"Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus, it's just not a virus."
95,52,The government is working on a joke about a virus. It's a joke.
100,52,"I’m not a doctor. I have a long history of having trouble breathing and a lot of people get sick from the sneezes in the public bathroom, and some people have a cold so they can’t stand breathing in a room. Its been a long time since I’ve worn masks. I’ve been in a hospital, so I’m going to keep that up. It can’t be done in the past. I can only imagine being in that room and having a sneeze that’s really going to stop,"
52,1,Is there a tarot card based on the tarot?
52,5,"AIDS is a really, really bad disease and it's also a shit joke."
52,6,A lot of people have a problem with the CDC's funding.
52,8,Is this going to be a joke?
52,14,"""I am a nutjob who doesn't get to talk to the government about anything but what the president has said. It's just a joke,"""
52,15,"CANNOTANSWER: I read this and was like, ""Fresh fuck me and I'm going to keep up the nonsense!""'"
52,16,Nope. Nope. But it doesn't matter. He's making a joke. He's just making it. Despite his sexist and sexist jokes. He's making it to the White House to make a joke.
52,22,A real joke. What they are trying to stop is a joke about the HIV epidemic. And they are trying to get the CDC to do something about it.
52,24,"I grew up in a place where people would wear a mask. I would have my kids in my room, and if I wanted to go to the dentist they would have to be there with me."
52,29,I would like to say that this is a joke. The joke isn't. It's a joke.
52,30,I don't like the way the CDC is trying to make a joke about the spread of AIDS.
52,31,This was a joke for sure.
52,32,The CDC is selling tarot cards with misleading headlines.
52,35,Vaccination is a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of the virus. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus. It’s not funny. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus. It’s a joke because it’s not affect the growth of a virus.
52,38,"> As a result of this scam, the CDC is trying to sell a new tarot deck and not a new tarot."
52,39,"Nope, I’m not sure. But you know if I’m being sexist and misleading, I’m just saying this because I’m a Republican and I think the joke is pretty jarring, and not because of what I like, but because the joke is just ridiculous and misleading."
52,43,"""""A hive mind is a way to keep a person from dying. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the growth of a virus."" """
61,52,This is a really good question. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,52,"I was trying to tell you something and I think it would be a lot easier to buy a deck of tarot cards and have the same set of cards? The tarot cards were fake, and my friend got a new one so I could use that as a joke. I'm sure there will be a lot of robbing that's what you said and I think the CDC is trying to make it clear that it's a scam and they are trying to make it clear that it's not a scam."
85,52,It's a joke because it's a joke.
87,52,"It's also a joke that a lot of people seem to be infuriated by, and that's if they don't have a computer or a tarot deck or no computer or any form of electronic technology."
