16,3,i m not a fan of this guy but i don't know about this guy personally he's a good guy he gets into trouble for wearing a mask he could have just said i forgot it if he didn't have a face mask and instead he put others first
16,10,A mask is a tool of the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,14,It's like a fad of a lie to make you want to fuck someone else who's got an infection and is trying to fix it. That's why they've stopped it.
16,15,"OP, I think OP is right about it that people don't wear masks and I don't want the same thing happen again. I want to wear a mask so I can do my thing and not try and get it out with the fucking doctor."
23,16,"If you were to die, a mask will make a person more likely to die. If it is a permanent damage, you have to get your health checked and have your health checked and be vaccinated as soon as possible. That means you don't have any reason to go vaccinated."
30,16,"Isn't it just me and my wife saying that we need to know what to do to prevent this? And if we can't, do what we want."
32,16,This was one of the stupidest things I've done in my entire life. I'm so scared of those who think putting on a mask to fend off an outbreak can be something like this.
38,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month
43,16,"Probably not so much on that front, it's just the reality that there are too many people on the news."
52,16,You are a smart ass who has a mask and can't talk.

92,16,The mask is only worn ten times and is worn ten times.

16,10,I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about. You should definitely get on the phone and talk to the govt's medical team.
16,14,"Well, we can only say that as a ""tourist"" and not a ""fad"" of a lie. The government is the one that must act. The govt should take every measure to prevent this kind of thing."
16,15,">Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them. The mask is only worn ten times and is worn ten times."
23,16,"Are you a lawyer? Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection. If you were to die, a mask will make a person more likely to die. If it is a permanent damage, you have to get your health checked and have your health checked and be vaccinated as soon as possible. That means you don't have any reason to go vaccinated."
30,16,"> It's really not necessary for a parent to be vaccinated, but is very important to a healthy child."
32,16,I'm not sure if you know what he meant.
38,16,"I do not like wearing masks in public, but I do wear a mask when I do not want to leave. I do not wear my mask when I go out, and if it is necessary to keep the game, I don't wear it."
43,16,> They also have a lot of money that is aimed at preventing an illness.
52,16,"I like how the person who has to wear a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people."
53,16,"a mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus,"
74,16,">We're a huge fan of this. i like wearing a mask, but i m sick of the prank. This sub is full of very stupid stuff. I guess people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask. IMO we need to find a way to hide the danger and protect the players. I guess people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask."
87,16,"Having a cloak on yourself, isn't an excuse to not have a mask."
92,16,I'm still scared and afraid of losing my mask and my purse.
16,3,"I'm sorry I couldn't answer this, because I am very allergic to them and have no idea what I'm referring to."
16,10,"I'm sick of the prank, but I'm sick of the real reason."
16,14,I like playing the NHL with the cloak on me when I'm playing with the cloak on me and how much the cloak is making me sick.
16,15,"The only time you'll get the right one is by saying, ""You have to wear your mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" This is a prank."
23,16,"We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected. If you're not infected, you can't wear a mask at an event, so you can't go."
30,16,I just want to make sure the hivemind is on the same page.
32,16,>I'm so afraid of those who think putting on a mask to fend off an outbreak can be something like this.
38,16,"Well, I can say that i personally like the ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign. But that doesn't mean you have to do it. It would be better for the guy wearing the mask to stand in front of his opponent's face instead. It's as if he's gonna put him in the position of the best possible leader."
43,16,> 'They also have a lot of money that is aimed at preventing an illness.
52,16,"It's funny how Trump uses ""Wearing a mask"" as a way to make a joke."
53,16,I can't imagine why this would happen if you didn't get a slap on the wrist and wore it. That's really the only thing in that situation that would happen to you if you did not wear a mask.
74,16,"I have to say, I'm a fan of this. It's not a prank but a warning. That's a pretty simple thing to do. They are making a lot of people uncomfortable and they really are not willing to change their hats to prevent the spread of viruses that they are not used to."
87,16,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In fact, in a nutshell, she's not a republican. This is in fact a Republican issue. It's a good idea to get a real one to help you if you want to."
92,16,I had to go back to work to have my own mask. I just had a relapse.
16,3,"I would imagine the worst part is how a couple of these things are just about to happen when you're in a public place. When someone is not in the area, it is almost impossible to get a good one if you don't have the mask on."
16,10,"""We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected."""
16,14,The first one explains it very well.
16,15,"... but the government can't prevent the spread of a virus, and it is making a lot of people uncomfortable."
23,16,It's like a giant fucking screw up in every aspect of the health care system.
30,16,This is why people wear masks. It's not like they're supposed to have to put a mask on for anyone but the kids to see a doctor about an illness.
32,16,I believe there's a lot of things that are being called fake vaccinations or people who wear masks to protect themselves.
38,16,I think it's a good idea to use it a lot more for a reason.
43,16,"I'm not a lawyer but I'm a lawyer. What about a person who has lost a mask? If it's not a scam, and a scumbag who has lost his a mask, it can't be a scam."
52,16,I think that was pretty funny and that I can't help but laugh that you did something to stop the spread of AIDS and not give your mother a better reason to be afraid.
53,16,Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?
74,16,You need to learn the first 10 words correctly.
87,16,"I hate that this is a joke, but in the end I don't feel like it's relevant anymore."
92,16,"I'm going to be the first to admit that I have a very bad memory about this. It's interesting to note that in the US, there's no way a medical doctor will give me that kind of information. But there is nothing that I can say to explain it. There are also places in the U.S. where the CDC is unsure."
16,3,"This shit is going to hurt you so much. You could be infected by it in a matter of hours, and your face will probably be ruined."
16,10,", ""[We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected.]"
16,14,"The first one explains it very well.... but the government can't prevent the spread of a virus, and it is making a lot of people uncomfortable. It's like a giant fucking screw up in every aspect of the health care system."
16,15,"Honestly, this is a funny joke and I think the guy that made it is just a prank."
23,16,"Because the federal government does not have the resources to create any protections, and instead has to rely on taxpayer dollars to keep the healthcare system going."
30,16,I've been sick so I can't eat my mask.
32,16,"I've been in a lot of medical emergencies, and the fact that you don't have a mask all means that you can't get a vaccine unless you're on sick leave."
38,16,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke about people who don't want to wear a mask, like the people who don't want to wear masks."
43,16,The fact that someone who lost their mask is an idiot is just a very odd coincidence. It's not really a scam. There aren't enough insurances. The only thing that matters is the insurance company. Is there a way they could protect them without having to be aware of the risks that they are exposed to.
52,16,CANNOTANSWER: I would rather be able to wear a mask while I'm trying to protect myself.
53,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?
74,16,You need to understand what a prank is - they're using it to stop a virus.
87,16,"The article is a lot of jokes, but there's nothing wrong with the joke being one."
92,16,"It's not a scam, it's a scam. The CDC says it's not a scam, and he's a scamster."
16,3,"CANNOTANSWER: I've been sick so I can't eat my mask. I've been in a lot of medical emergencies, and the fact that you don't have a mask all means that you can't get a vaccine unless you're on sick leave."
16,10,You said that this guy is just a prank. So I don't think it's a joke.
16,14,"I'm not a lawyer, but I don't watch the TV..."
16,15,I don't get why people don't wear masks. If I can't wear one I have to get a doctor's prescription to treat it and get it back. It's the same thing a few years back.
23,16,"Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection. If you were to die, a mask will make a person more likely to die. If it is a permanent damage, you have to get your health checked and be vaccinated as soon as possible. That means you don't have any reason to go vaccinated."""
30,16,You are right. This isn't the truth. We are all a joke. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
32,16,"If you wear a mask to be able to go to work you can be part of a dpr program that helps spread the virus, aka a narcotic."
38,16,"I am a lawyer, so I am not sure I understand your question. The government has been very clear about this for some time now, including allowing a large number of 'common sense' and 'the public' as a whole."
43,16,Vaccinating yourself isn't a crime in the US. It is a medical treatment. You know our right to die and infect (kill) others.
52,16,"The joke ""Wearing a mask"" is a joke about how ""The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone."
53,16,"If you're a hockey coach and you're not a professional hockey coach, this isn't something you should wear."
74,16,I don't see the value in trying to hide something from a potential victim. I think people should understand that this isn't a joke. That's a legitimate reason for not wanting to have your face blown off by your own team.
87,16,"I don't think you know why the article is going viral. I think you've got a point. The joke is relevant, but doesn't get it's point across."
92,16,"I like the word ""scam"" a lot. I think it's an interesting thing about the CDC and how it's not a scam."
16,3,"Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection. If you were to die, a mask will make a person more likely to die. If it is a permanent damage, you have to get your health checked and be vaccinated as soon as possible. That means you don't have any reason to go vaccinated."
16,10,No. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
16,14,"""the CDC is using it to stop the spread of a virus. The fact that someone who lost their mask is an idiot is just a very odd coincidence. It's not really a scam. There aren't enough insurances. The only thing that matters is the insurance company. Is there a way they could protect them without having to be aware of the risks that they are exposed to."
16,15,What is a prank?
23,16,I think it's just the fact that it is a part of the system that is making a point of people being shit on.
30,16,>I hate it when people don't wear masks in public.
32,16,"I'm actually going to give you my blessing. Thank you, and you have a wonderful day."
38,16,""" I think it's a good idea to use it a lot more for a reason. I can say that i personally like the ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign."
43,16,"I can't really remember the exact details of this but I'm looking at it as ""you guys's mask."""
52,16,Obama is a troll because he was able to make a joke about the AIDS epidemic because he is a troll and he is trying to be a troll.
53,16,"So how does the USA do that? It's a good question, but what is your opinion on the issue?"
74,16,"Apparently, you swore a hat as a way to stop the spread of an infectious disease and the hat is a joke."
87,16,"So, I'm going to give the fucking truth. That doesn't sound very credible. If the government has anything to worry about, the first step will be to take the fight to a more serious level than the one they've been doing. It will be time to make a real choice. The government has also shown that that's not the way to go if it's a really good idea."
92,16,"It's a scam because the medical doctors tell the people who do it to make money, and get paid for it and then take that money out to do something about it."
16,3,">The joke ""Wearing a mask"" is a joke about how ""The masks in the white house are often a way to hide the fact that you're African American and a very inflammatory disease, and they are not a real threat to anyone. If you're a hockey coach and you're not a professional hockey coach, this isn't something you should wear."
16,10,So the joke doesn't exist?
16,14,Vaccination is the only method available that prevents people from dying of an infectious disease.
16,15,"... but the government can't prevent the spread of a virus, and it is making a lot of people uncomfortable. It's the same thing a few years ago."
23,16,The US government is getting into the middle ground :
30,16,You are an idiot. If I had no choice - I would be too. And the best way to stop that is to stop it.
32,16,"I don't think he had the confidence to tell that guy about what he did. He was a dick, he's an idiot. It's not a scam, it's a joke."
38,16,">I’m going to ask him why he can’t get the med. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though."
43,16,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children.'"
52,16,It's not a joke and it's not true. It's a nonsense and a lie. It's not a joke or a joke.
53,16,I would have to say that you're not a hockey coach.
74,16,">We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
87,16,It's a joke.
92,16,"In the US, there's no way a medical doctor will give you that kind of information."
16,3,"This is a very good discussion of the issue, in the context of the issue. The guy being the most serious troll in this thread is a troll who wants to blame the government for helping the AIDS epidemic, the president, the president, and everything else in the administration."
16,10,a doctor and a white house press office can go to lengths to make jokes about the Obama Administration's use of masks.
16,14,"This isn't just a joke, but a reality show."
16,15,The only way to stop the disease is to be safe.
23,16,I'm a guy who tries to get a vaccinated person in the US and it's one of the best ways to start a family.
30,16,"What is the point of wearing a mask? Are you really that good at explaining it? If you don't know what it's doing, maybe you need to give a more specific explanation."
32,16,"I'm a woman who wore a mask. I have a big fear of the people in my family. They want to help me keep me safe and out of danger, and that's exactly how I see them."
38,16,"I'm going to use this more as a reason. The best part is that the mask is not necessary to prevent people from saying ""I can't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."""
43,16,"""It is a scam. It is an indefensible thing to do. I'm not sure what you mean but I'm looking at it as ""you guys's mask."""
52,16,">It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s a joke, not the issue. It’s not a joke, not a joke or a joke."
53,16,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government. It's not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't.
74,16,This is pretty much what the Obama administration is trying to prevent.
87,16,"It's a real thing, and not just a tarot card."
92,16,"Vaccination is not a scam, it is because it is a serious illness. You need to get a vaccine for it, and get the money back. If you lose the mask, and get the money back, you are a scammer."
16,3,"Vaccination is a scam. It's not a scam. It's because it is a serious illness. You need to get a vaccine for it, and get the money back, you are a scammer."
16,10,"[No. You can't get into contact with other people without a mask. The whole reason you're bringing it up is because it is not in the government. The presidents office is working with the other govts. In addition, it's pretty much a fake show."
16,14,"You know, the thing that is so weird about vaccination is that he lost his mask because he was too bloated to take a picture with them."
16,15,"I just wanted to point out that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I read this as ""We are the only people who don't 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children."""
23,16,"They want you to eat, sleep, and exercise, even the most basic thing."
30,16,You are being racist. You are being racist.
32,16,What if you don't have a mask?
38,16,I'm trying to put my perspective on this. This is the way I see it.
43,16,I'm pretty sure the first thing he said was you guys have a mask. He is also claiming to have AIDS. I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it. It doesn't make sense to wear one to protect people who don't wear one but are willing to do it to protect themselves.
52,16,"He's talking to a man. He wants to tell the people who have an HIV infection, he wants them to protect themselves. He wants a public safety demonstration for how he's doing it."
53,16,That's not the way AIDS is treated in the US - it's a virus.
74,16,There are a lot of things we need to learn and realize.
87,16,"Apparently this is a joke. It sounds like you're being downvoted, but I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. The government is the one that made this a joke, but he is not a troll. He is trying to hide that he is a troll. nothing."
92,16,"If you can't get a doctor to test it and get a full refund and get the money back, you are in the twilight era."
16,3,"This is where the ""false"" joke comes in."
16,10,The president is a troll.
16,14,You could use a CDC fake version of this post to re-affirm the meaning of the law.
16,15,"And in this instance, ""I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it. You need to get a doctor to test it and get a full refund and get the money back, you are a scammer."""
23,16,"""We have to get a mask in order for people to have an immune system. We just have to make sure the public doesn't get infected.

""It's like a giant fucking screw up in every aspect of the healthcare system."", ""The CDC is getting into the middle ground : """
30,16,I do like to say that this is a joke.
32,16,The problem is that people who wear masks are essentially telling the story of someone who did it because he was a dick. The problem is that the CDC wants to shut them down.
38,16,"In the US, it's illegal to wear a mask at all."
43,16,I'm just gonna add some facts. Vaccination is a legitimate sex and safety measure. They're not going to have the money to fight this.
52,16,This is all a sexist slur.
53,16,I don't think this was a prank. I think this is the best thing we have to do as a government.
74,16,"Then I want to get on the front page and have some fun while reading the article, and the comments."
87,16,"I don't really care for the guy who said that is not a joke, but I do think the government is trying to stop it. Obama's anti-ISIS sentiment is incompatible with the issue of AIDS."
92,16,I lost my mask and my money and lost it to the IRS! I feel bad about it.
16,3,It's a joke.
16,10,"The whole reason I'm bringing it up is because it is not in the government. The CDC wants to shut them down. In the US, it's illegal to wear a mask at all."
16,14,>I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it.
16,15,"As a US citizen I'm worried about being taken out by an HIV infection. So you could be a scammer. Apparently the President has a very serious problem with this, and is trying to do it while also getting to the truth."
23,16,"I've never heard of the tarot, but in my life it seems as though the tarot cards work to protect people from the virus. That is a really good reason to get vaccinated."
30,16,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's not a scam. The government is using this to get people to get vaccinated. It's a joke.
32,16,"I know, I'm a huge AIDS researcher. This is going to be a very difficult time. I'm not sure what you're talking about. I think this is a really good way to put it."
38,16,I'm a lawyer. I just want to put my perspective on this. This is the way I see it.
43,16,I read an article once saying that the CDC's actions against the hive mind were completely fraudulent.
52,16,You can't change the mask if you don't have a mask on. That doesn't exist. Vaccination isn't a health issue.
53,16,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think this was a prank. I think this is the best thing we have to do as a government.
74,16,"If your team has any way of showing up on stage, it's because they have a mask and no one can come out. Is that how you get people to sit at your place without a mask or just because they're comfortable with it? If so, you might want to take the time and consider taking this one to the doctors or whatever."
87,16,"""If I was the president, I would want to rescind the decision to not wear a mask because a doctor is supposedly going to use a tape measure. """
92,16,"There is a real reason the government keeps selling fake medical devices. People want to buy more fake medical devices, and not get one they bought from the government."
16,3,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
16,10,I read about the President and the jokes about the Bush administration. But I think I read too much.
16,14,"Well a hive mind and a mask do not make a hive mind. The masks are used for sex and not to protect against a virus. And you're right, it's illegal to have a mask when the virus has spread, but it's not to prevent infection, because it's an infectious disease that doesn't affect you at all."
16,15,i'm not sure why someone should be thinking that i'm a shithead but this isn't an article about anything.
23,16,"The article is pretty good, it was a good bit controversial but the first part is a bit too sarcastic."
30,16,"In all likelihood, the CDC and their public health representatives in DC are going to be pretty harsh on this stuff in the near future."
32,16,"I think this is a good way to put it. It's a joke, a prank, and it's not like he's the one who was the one who has it."
38,16,The only way to know is to read the tarot cards.
43,16,This isn't the first time that I've come across this type of scam.
52,16,Vaccination isn't a health issue.
53,16,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,16,"AIDS is a huge issue and it should be a major priority for the president. Whether it's a joke, it's a joke, and it is no joke."
87,16,"""If I were the president, I would want to rescind the decision to not wear a mask because a doctor is supposedly going to use a tape measure."""
92,16,[NAME] is a nurse.
16,3,"You're not being a prick, you're being a troll. Your name isn't being a troll. You're not a troll, you're just being a troll. You're the only one who knows."
16,10,"CDC wants to shut down the office of the president, but is not allowing anyone to use one on the stage."
16,14,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You can't change the mask if you don't have a mask on. That doesn't exist. Vaccination isn't a health issue."""
16,15,he's trying to use a hive mind to stop the spread of a virus
23,16,[Nope.](http://www.nytimes.com/news/2004/11/r/news/Tarot-Reports-The_Fair-Scam-Is_Tarot-The-Closer-of-Civil-Problems/)
30,16,Is there a CDC poster in there saying that if they don't get sick from it they are going to make more people vaccinate them?
32,16,[CNN](http://www.ny.gov/CNN/D/Denmark/definitions/Denmark/definitions/Denmark.aspx).
38,16,"That's not a joke, it's a joke, a joke."
43,16,"I had a friend of mine who lost a hive mind. It's a health care mask, the only way to stop it is to prevent it. He never really used the mask, he'd go through the pain of wearing it, and his mind wouldn't change."
52,16,Vaccination isn't a health issue.
53,16,"Vaccines are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and it's not a prank."
74,16,AIDS is an issue. The president is concerned about the spread of it.
87,16,"The jokes he's making about AIDS aren't serious. They are about what he thinks is a valid joke. That doesn't sound reasonable. He's telling a joke that the government has done nothing to stop it. I know it's a joke and I know it's a joke, but this one is snarky and a joke, but it's just a joke. I hate the joke, but the joke is not even funny. The joke isn't a joke."
92,16,Vaccination is not a scam.
16,3,What's this post about? Vaccination is not a health issue. The President is not using a mask to stop the spread of a virus. AIDS is a huge issue and it should be a major priority for the president.
16,10,"Yes, we don't see this as a serious issue."
16,14,Vaccination is a health issue. The president is concerned about the spread of a virus. The jokes he's making about AIDS aren't serious. They are about what he thinks is a valid joke.
16,15,"""You have to wear your mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
23,16,It's like a shitball in my book.
30,16,"Yes, people need to wear masks because they don't think it is necessary and it's a common joke."
32,16,"I believe it's a pretty good way to put it. ""Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it's not an epidemic and it's a disease"""
38,16,"This is actually what happens when the CDC doesn't give a mandate on anything, and if you're on a plane or in a car that is not covered by insurance, they get a refund for any loss you make from a medical claim."
43,16,Vaccination is a serious health-care problem and I am not a lawyer but my favorite person to talk to as a doctor is someone who lost their hive mind.
52,16,I'm pretty sure this was just a joke to fuck off a few months ago.
53,16,"I know a bunch of people who are not in the same field of medicine as them, but they don't realize what they're doing. It's all just a prank, it's all a joke and no one is going to even know what it is."
74,16,"""We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."""
87,16,"That is a valid joke, but it is not relevant anymore. He's telling a joke that the government has nothing to do to stop it. He's telling a joke that the government has done nothing to stop it."
92,16,"So basically saying, ""I lost my mask and my money and lost it to the IRS!"" And then describing that in a more negative way... it sounded like they had a really shady story to tell people, or at least they were."
16,3,"I had a friend who lost a hive mind. It's a health care mask, the only way to stop it is to prevent it. He never really used the mask, he'd go through the pain of wearing it, and his mind wouldn't change. Vaccination isn't a health issue. Vaccines are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and it's not a prank."
16,10,It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke. I love to talk to people that are not in the same field of medicine as me.
16,14,"This is a great point, I feel like it would be an interesting and meaningful piece of research. This is an interesting and interesting subject with a lot of good points."
16,15,Is it possible that this isn't actually a prank?
23,16,It’s a joke. The tarot card was actually a joke. It wasn’t even a tarot card. There are so many myths out there.
30,16,"It's really not necessary for a parent to be vaccinated, but is very important to a healthy child."
32,16,"'Adamant that it's not a disease, but the fact that it's not an epidemic and it's a disease''."
38,16,I have to say this to one of the guys I know that wear a mask. And I am not certain.
43,16,"I read it as ""Mask me to wear a mask and stop having to die and infect others."""
52,16,"A tarot card is a fucking joke that's being made a few months ago based off of a book you read. Whether the man is really serious, or what the government is trying to sell is beyond me."
53,16,">I'm going to ask a guy how he came to the conclusion that he doesn't care for the ""I don't"" word. Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?''"
74,16,"> ""I hate to sound like a jerk, but it's not quite the right way to put it. I hate to say, I'm a fan of this. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
87,16,I’m not going to cite that one.
92,16,"I'm sorry but I can't seem to find anyone that can, in all seriousness, understand why the CDC does this."
16,3,"""Vaccination is not a health issue. Vaccines are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and it's not a prank."""
16,10,It's a joke. It's a joke.
16,14,So here is my theory: it's illegal to have a mask on someone who's dying of an infectious disease and it's not a health issue.
16,15,So it’s not a joke?
23,16,"A few years ago, one of my friends told me that it was a tarot card and that she didn't know anything about the tarot card until he brought it up again. Then he said, ""It's like a giant fucking screw up in every aspect of the healthcare system."""
30,16,"Are you going to ask, ""How are you going to know what's going on?"""
32,16,"""I'm so afraid of those who think putting on a mask to fend off an outbreak can be something like this."","
38,16,They're not the only ones who want to deal with government nonsense.
43,16,They're only in the US. So they are in the US. They are not scams.
52,16,"As a child I was the first person to say this, which is why it came up so often on Twitter and FB."
53,16,"A prankster is a prankster. They aren't trying to stop it, they are attempting to prevent it."
74,16,That's a joke? And I know some people who are serious about the game and just don't believe it.
87,16,"There is nothing wrong with a joke, and when you say that, I get it's not as serious as a joke, but it is valid."
92,16,"I'm not talking about an American but I'm talking about how you can't get a vaccinated person to use a mask, if he isn't a doctor, and they are actually using the same medical device in the United States as they do in Canada, and it seems like a pretty logical way to go about getting a vaccinated person to use a mask."
16,3,"In an ideal world, the government has to help prevent the spread of disease from becoming a big deal and have the government take steps to keep people safe. If it's an epidemic, and people have a virulent illness, they don't have to live like that."
16,10,As long as it is the Obama administration. This is not a joke.
16,14,"Well, they don't care about vaccination. They're just gonna keep making fake jokes and pretend that it's a joke."
16,15,"I've had people asking me to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. I didn't get the right answer. I'm not saying this is a joke, but it's a funny joke and it's a joke."
23,16,Its not a joke. Its a joke.
30,16,My kids still have a tarot card and he wears a mask to avoid this
32,16,"A guy I knew who was an attorney claims that he won't take his friend's tarot card because of fraud is a fraud. The article cites in the headline that there's a large gap between the US and the Canadian government. ''We can never forget that stuff""' is a quote from a doc."
38,16,"[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What is the word ""joke"" in this thread? I don't know why this guy is going to resign, but he is doing a good job. I'm not a huge fan of pranks or rumors. I want to know what is going on in the CDC's office? Then, what is the joke about being a woman and allowing her to be a fucking"
43,16,"""Well if you're thinking of the whole ""hive mind joke,"" you have to think about how it's actually a joke, but it's a joke. Why are the people who say that are still trolls? Then I went to the CDC's office and they're the only ones you can get to work with. It has nothing to do with AIDS."
52,16,I'm a guy with a phobia of Obama. I don't want to get vaccinated.
53,16,That's just a joke.
74,16,">We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
87,16,"IANAL but the OP said that they are all tarot cards so they are more likely to be on the internet now than ever and that they are a good thing for them. But they are not fake, they are just an inflection for the media to point to, and it's a cliche."
92,16,This is about a person that is trying to save the country from the real AIDS epidemic.
16,3,"If the President tries to stop the spread of a virus, I'm going to put a red flag on this post, and tell you that he's not getting it."
16,10,It's a joke to call the CDC a prankster.
16,14,That's a good point. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
16,15,Yes. We are all a joke.
23,16,"I'm gonna have to say, ""That's a joke. It's a joke. The tarot card isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."""
30,16,Vaccination is a joke.
32,16,Is a mask in the story a lie?
38,16,"People are making jokes about them and it's not funny, but I'm not a big fan of the government but I'm not a huge fan of pranks or rumors. I don't know why the CDC is taking it personally, but I know the people who think they are putting it on people and people aren't in a position to care for them."
43,16,Vaccination is a legitimate sex and safety measure. They are not scams.
52,16,"There's a joke about ""the sexism thing, not the terrorism thing"" in this post, but I think it was intended to be a joke."
53,16,A prankster does not want to get in contact with another person who is vaccinated. He wants to avoid getting into contacts with someone who is not a professional hockey coach.
74,16,"Are the president and the players in this video being very serious about the AIDS vaccine, or does the president have any kind of reason to think that they can be jokes in a way that they will be able to prevent the spread of a virus?"
87,16,"A tarot card isn't a tarot card, but a tarot deck is a tarot card."
92,16,I'm gonna take that as an indication that I'm going to be a scamster.
16,3,"I didn't see any comments, and I'm not saying this to be a joke, but I think that I'm making a valid point."
16,10,"I think you're right. It's funny to see the president doing that, but it's not like it's a joke."
16,14,"Vaccination is a joke, but not a crime in the us."
16,15,"I'd love to read more about this, but it makes sense because it seems like the President is trying to use it as a joke, not as an actual sex joke."
23,16,"I believe this post was written by a psychiatrist, who was dealing with the spread of the disease and having to get a restraining order to prevent people from becoming sick from having an infective disease. The doctor stated that people who get sick because of the tarot cards have to get vaccinated."
30,16,It's the joke I have heard. It's not as if a CDC doctor could wear a mask that is meant to prevent a virus from spreading a person's body.
32,16,"I'd love to know more, but this seems like a fun story that is not just a joke."
38,16,I see no problem with it being a joke. Is this the one you're going to tell Obama? Is he willing to work with the government? Because I'm a very experienced person with that.
43,16,I'm not even a lawyer.
52,16,I'm not a politician or I'm not a politician.
53,16,"This is my favorite tarot card to watch a hockey coach wear one. It's a good point, and a good reason to use it."
74,16,"The President wore a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS, and he doesn't actually know what a prank is. It's only a prank because he believes it's true."
87,16,"I agree, tarot cards are a little off putting. I wouldn't want to read any of these, but just remember that I'm a tarot reader so I know that I have no issues with this stuff."
92,16,"I don't think it's a scam... I think they're just trying to get people to get the treatment and then getting them to think that's scam. I think this is what AIDS is, and it's one of the biggest problems people face."
16,3,Because the White House has made this kind of decision to defund all the government aid and make it work on the AIDS epidemic.
16,10,I want to get off your high horse.
16,14,"The guy was a prankster. The tarot card said he was taking this as a joke, but he's right about the joke."
16,15,>If I can't wear one I have to get a doctor's prescription to treat it and get it back. It's the same thing a few years ago.
23,16,"This is not a joke, it's a joke. The CDC is trying to discredit the meme by calling it ""a joke"" and not to say that the tarot cards are a joke."
30,16,Yes. Is it possible to a doctor that is not a doctor at all to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus? No. Is it possible to prevent people from getting sick from a virus?
32,16,It's one of those things people think they are being treated like an immigrant. I think it is very important to get this done now that it is happening.
38,16,I do not think I understand how you want to use the CDC's “jobs” joke.
43,16,The CDC has no interest in changing the laws. They are making it seem like it's a criminal act.
52,16,I’m going to throw it out there that you didn’t read my post and didn’t even notice you’re referring to Obama despite what you’re saying.
53,16,I had a friend who was a hockey coach and the guy asked him to wear a mask because he thought he wasn't doing well. I never got a response.
74,16,>Is that how you get people to sit at your place without a mask?
87,16,"This isn't a tarot card, it's a chart. If you're a tarot card reader, you can just take the tarot card and put it on the deck."
92,16,What a shitty place to post this. I'd love to have my mask on. It will take a while to do what it takes to do it. I don't want a ton of publicity and they don't want me to make it up to my face.
16,3,"In a nutshell, the President is only trying to stop it, so no. This joke isn't a prank. It is a joke."
16,10,"What a joke. The CDC is trying to discredit the tarot card meme, which is a joke."
16,14,He's going to have a hard time remembering his post from this week.
16,15,"I want to be out there, in my hometown of Cleveland, and all I see on the tarot card is a face — a face, a head — a hood. I need a mask, not the mouth."
23,16,"Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection. If you were to die, a mask will make a person more likely to die. If it is a permanent damage, you have to get your health checked and be vaccinated as soon as possible. That means you don't have any reason to go vaccinated."""
30,16,"There are other aforementioned jokes out there. A lot of the worst ones are actually those that don't get vaccinated, because the only one you have is the CDC, who aren't that big of a deal. They're also really bad at putting you on stage and making you look like an ass."
32,16,I would not have an issue with this.
38,16,"That's actually what happens when the CDC doesn't give a mandate on anything, and if you're on a plane or in a car that is not covered by insurance, they get a refund for any loss you make from a medical claim. I've done a lot of dumb things. Is the CDC doing their job? That's a prank. I've read your post. They are cliches of people using tampons to stop people from getting AIDS. I'm going to go back to the CDC"
43,16,The FDA will pay your doctor for your life and the CDC will pay your shit back.
52,16,"[Tom Clancy, M.D.](http://www.hwa.org/article/hwa/hwa/2008.html)"
53,16,Vaccination is not a prank. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. He's not going to get a vaccine. He's going to go to the ER to see if they're making fun of him. He's not going to get a vaccine. He's going to get a doctor. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we can't stop... That's an incompetent way of saying it.
74,16,He needs to wear a mask when the doctor thinks he has an AIDS infection.
87,16,"""Tarot is a card. I want to see a tarot card and it sounds like it's a card, not just a card."""
92,16,"As a nurse who had a relapse, I can say with confidence that the person who tried the mask is a scammer."
16,3,"""The CDC is making it seem like it's a criminal act."
16,10,"This CDC joke has the worst humour. It makes a lot of sense, but I would be pretty baffled if they were to tell people to fuck off to the CDC, because the CDC had no interest in changing the laws."
16,14,"I had a friend who lost her head and her face, and my mask was infected with an AIDS virus. I wanted to go back and see if they got a refund on my medical bills. He didn't."
16,15,"I know this is a joke, but in reality I don't care. Vaccinations are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The CDC has no interest in changing the laws. They are making it seem like it's a criminal act. I've been on a tarot deck and found it hard to believe that it's actually a joke."
23,16,The joke about a deck of tarot cards being a joke in your book is the one that caused the joke.
30,16,I'm not racist. I'm just joking.
32,16,I feel the CDC has no obligation to do that and this isn't a prank either.
38,16,"Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. CDC has stated that it isn't an anti-viral drug. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. It's trying to make the people who are actually sick and getting vaccinated understand that vaccines are not a joke. It's a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does. The government is trying to make the people who are still infected, or, and/or, and/or, or,"

52,16,He is trying to scuff things.
53,16,"The CDC is going to continue to be making fun of a guy who isn't getting the vaccine, and putting his mask on, because he doesn't want to get in contact with anyone who isn't vaccinated. He wants to keep playing the game he's in."
74,16,"So, the president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS."
87,16,What is the difference between a tarot card and a real one?
92,16,"As someone who has been in this scenario, the CDC is trying to create a false information loophole."
16,3,"""... if you're in a bunch of people, and you don't have a mask, and you're not getting a vaccine, you're not getting a vaccine. This isn't a joke. The CDC is making it seem like it's a criminal act."
16,10,They are threatening to shut down the CDC because they think the president has a health problem.
16,14,"It's a joke. The doctor who got the vaccine should have acted on it. I'm sorry, CDC."
16,15,It doesn't seem to be a prank. It's just a joke.
23,16,Vaccination is a joke because they don't have the resources to create protections. They are trying to discredit a joke because they believe they are a scam.
30,16,"A lot of this stuff is based on an old story, namely that people have an extremely bad rape history and have made a fool of themselves. That's a pretty serious thing to ask people - you know, you're trying to rewrite your history in your mind."
32,16,"The CDC is not an official agency, they aren't a dpr agency."
38,16,"The fact that they are using it as a way of avoiding a discussion of HIV is a very real question and I'm sorry, but I know the answer to it is:"
43,16,"The only thing that matters is the insurance company. Is there a way they could protect them without having to be aware of the risks that they are exposed to?"","
52,16,Is it any joke that a black person wants to wear a mask for a viral infection?
53,16,"I'm sorry the CDC isn't willing to do more in this context. There is no way to make sure it doesn't get in contact with anyone, it's not safe for someone. And the CDC is going to say ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccination isn't just a safety issue. They can't use it to cure diseases. The article has little to nothing to do with it."
74,16,"The prank itself is not a joke, it's the prank."
87,16,I would love to try and understand what's going on here.
92,16,They are trying to make people think they are scammers. They are just trying to get people to be happy.
16,3,I think the president can say they're right to get a shot at the CDC in the future. But the guy just sounds like a troll.
16,10,"In our country, it's illegal to wear a mask, and the only people who actually get the vaccine are the CDC."
16,14,Yes. The CDC is trying to discredit that.
16,15,What you're talking about is the president's attempt to scream at a tarot card. There's no fucking way of telling him that he has AIDS and that he's not going to do the right thing.
23,16,... it's a joke. Its a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
30,16,"A lot of people seem to be saying ""Hey, you've been sick and you can't eat your mask."" It's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke, and I think it's pretty silly that it's used as a joke. It's a joke."
32,16,That's really just a bunch of shit I don't really understand. It's just a funny way to say something.
38,16,"Yes, it's a joke."
43,16,Vaccination is a legitimate medical procedure. It is not a crime in the US.
52,16,The entire issue is one that satisfies some of the comments. They're not a joke.
53,16,We're just trying to keep the US from bringing up AIDS.
74,16,The government is trying to help stop the spread of AIDS.
87,16,The only thing is tarot cards aren't a tarot decks - they're all cards based on some other sort of information. You can do this with a paper. There's a lot of tarot cards based on tarot cards too. You can get the decks out there too and still have fun. The trick is to use them if you don't want to get tarot cards as a tool.
92,16,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not a scam because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is.
16,3,"Vaccination is not a health issue. Vaccines are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and they are not a prank. They are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and it is not a criminal act."
16,10,"It was my choice to get the vaccine, but I don't get it."
16,14,This is a shit story about a guy trying to take his mask and getting shot. He's telling a joke to the president whose face is infected with AIDS and is attempting to have the president scream a tarot card for a good laugh.
16,15,"People do not know that they are a prank unless they know that the president has a viral infection. It's a prank, not a joke."
23,16,"There's some pretty fucked up conspiracy theory going on, but it's still a funny story."
30,16,"So basically I was going to say 'A lot of people seem to be saying ""Hey, you've been sick and you can't eat your mask."" I was going to say ""Damn it!"" and then it was up to me. ""No, I'm not a racist, I'm not racist, I'm not racist. I'm not racist. I'm not racist. I'm not racist. I'm not racist."" ""The joke isn't a joke."" ""A lot of people seem to be saying ""Well, I'"
32,16,Vaccination is a slur.
38,16,"It's actually the joke that people are going to get in a prank. They're going to tell someone, ""I am not a big fan of the CDC but I am not sure I understand your question."""
43,16,This is how the world will be if we all die.
52,16,I'm so sorry this guy's voice can't be made up. I hope to help you.
53,16,It's funny you said this and that's a joke. I didn't realize there were actually doctors in the US?
74,16,"The president has no obligation to make a joke, even though he has a job that requires them to wear a mask."

30,16,I’ve had a lot of shit from the CDC about how I was wrong about not getting vaccinated and how a person can wear a mask. I’ve had a lot of shit about being vaccinated.
