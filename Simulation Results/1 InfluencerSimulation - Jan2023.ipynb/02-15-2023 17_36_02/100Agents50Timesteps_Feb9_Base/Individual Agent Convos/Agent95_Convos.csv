98,95,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
100,95,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
95,1,The reason I got my first helmet was because I was looking for my next coach to be on a ice box.
95,4,"This is a serious issue. If this is a thing, you can’t force your players to wear a mask. They must be wearing a mask that you aren’t comfortable with. It’s not an easy thing to do. It’s the exact opposite of a bad thing. The players are forced to wear a mask at work or play football. They need a helmet to practice."
95,6,A new report says the helmet will still cover the body and lungs - but it won't protect the head and lungs. It can cause respiratory issues like this.
95,18,"Is the fact that you said to a friend, that you'd love to be a coach with them and not with the players are the dumbest things in the world? That's ridiculous."

95,41,"So they just call people a team, and if they don't do something wrong they are a team?"
95,52,"Do you even have to wear a mask? No, you do not."
95,58,My favorite part of my game is how the guys on the team in my class used to do so many stunts to try and keep the players in their sleep
95,62,"The first time a person wears a mask it gets really funny. I know if they resign and coach a coach after it tries to put on a mask, then they're just a guy who's a little too old for a regular hockey team."

95,82,I'm also afraid to say...
95,86,"I'm sorry but I think this is just my personal opinion. The fact that I was the only one who did this to me is actually pretty interesting. I would definitely never wear a mask at all. If you haven't seen it before it may have been a symptom of a virus causing you to have to play, and if you are, I would say that wearing a mask isn't a good idea because that's something that many players want to avoid."

100,95,They're not really useless. They're just a symptom of the common problem that everyone has and can't do.
95,1,I'm gonna go on and on.
95,4,"If you can't get off and get a helmet, it's a good idea."
95,6,The government isn't addressing the health concerns of players in the context of preventing the spread of the virus.
95,18,"I think you haven't seen it before, but when you do it correctly, it's not a bad thing."
95,36,"I would totally never wear a mask, if I was a football coach."
95,40,If the mask is made to be worn and worn properly it's not a problem.
95,41,"There's a great book titled 'The Man Who Got The Virus,' by Robert F. Devine, titled the ""My Man Who Got the Virus,"" which is about how masks are used to stop the spread of a virus."
95,52,I think your question about the reason why one official or admin can't force a coach to wear a mask is completely inaccurate.
95,58,"There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is. I'm a lvl 19 so it's not fair for the government to do something as simple as making a mask and having it put on is a bad idea."
95,62,Then they're not as much a team as the players.
95,63,I feel like the guy who says he was the only one who did it is right.
95,69,"i love the whole putting on a mask and then taking off the helmet thing is my favorite part of it. it's weird and depressing, but it's what i do and i love syringes in a mask."
95,82,I'm sorry but I think this is just my personal opinion. The fact that I was the only one who did this to me is actually pretty interesting.
95,86,A mask - a mask that protects the throat and mouth - that's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,94,Its a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. The ice isn't like that. But they are. The game just isn't going to stop. It'll just start and just stop. It's not like a guy who needs to change shirts.
98,95,wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
100,95,i think they're being facetious.
95,1,The government is supposed to have this. It's what they do.
95,4,[Women are forced to wear masks.](http://www.nyc.gov/government/hiv-care-and-fun-reach/responsible-play-advice-and-care-to-play-advice-and-care-advice-at-training-school/). I don't think that's a great thing. I don't think that's the way it is.
95,6,he's the one who said he was the only one who did it

95,41,"There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is."
95,52,"I don't think the government is the best at protecting the people, but it's kind of like ""The government has made up a story of what happened. I've been smothered in some of this nonsense for over a decade. I can't even imagine what a joke it is that I've done."""
95,58,"I don't see how they could prevent the spread of a virus when they're in the game with other players. There is also a book titled ""The Man Who Got The Virus,"" which is about how masks are used to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. But they are. The game just isn't going to stop. It'll just start and just stop. It's not like a guy who needs to change shirts."
95,62,The government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. But they are.
95,63,You aren't the only one who did this. That is a legitimate concern to me. I understand that people are fucking a mask.
95,69,"It's very interesting that a few people on Reddit have written about this and a few people have said that it's not fair that a politician can't force a government official to wear a mask, but that some politicians are essentially just asking for a shitload of people to put on a mask."
95,82,No one has been telling me they can't make a mask for the majority of the games.
95,86,"You can go see the movie, The Man Who Got The Virus. It's on Netflix."
95,94,"In any other situation, if it helps, that is a symptom of a virus."
98,95,"It was the hardest thing of my life, I was so afraid of what could happen to me, and I had to leave the place, I was terrified of how dangerous that was to me. But I walked right by and my body froze."

95,40,"It's also an issue of the government putting on masks, which are part of the problem, not the problem."
95,41,I think the guy who got the virus was the only one.
95,52,I've heard it said in one of the interviews that he said it could be a good idea for people to go to the CDC and get screened.
95,58,It's a joke to everyone. They're being facetious.
95,62,What a ridiculous joke. You don't need a mask to play hockey. Your body is not at risk of developing this virus.

95,82,I read a book about this in a comment that you might have read recently about how a guy who got the virus in the NHL made people wear masks. Those things have a bit of a ring to it and don't make a difference if you're not comfortable with them.
95,86,He said something about being the only person who smothered a virus in his life.

98,95,This is exactly what I was going to do.
100,95,"I think the problem with this is that it's not a good idea to put a mask on and not wear it unless it's a new complication of a virus. It's not a good idea, because it doesn't work. Basically, a mask can't fix a problem, because there's a good chance that a new complication will happen."

95,63,''People like you are not a good person. I can't imagine being that person if I weren't a fan of their sport but we shouldn't have to smother them with masks. '''It's very normal for us to be scared of being out in public for hours at a time when you are in public and you're afraid of how you'll get infected.'''

100,95,I can imagine the cigs that we'd smoke if the cigarette were all numb or there was no fucking coughing.

95,40,What the CDC is trying to do is to promote AIDS awareness among the community and prevent it.
95,41,I just got off work and I’m a little bit sick of seeing this joke.
95,52,"CANNOTANSWER said that a lot of these jokes aren't about the government, but the government is."
95,58,Probably what I'm looking for here:
95,62,"That's not a joke, I've heard a lot of people like that."
95,63,"You're not the only one who did it. This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It’s not a joke. It is a joke, but the government is. A joke. It’s a joke."
95,69,"I really hope this is a 'CNN' for all the people pointing to CDC to get away from the government.

95,86,So it's a joke that the people who are trying to combat HIV/AIDS are really the ones who are blaming the government.
95,94,"What's more important, is that you aren't the first person to say a joke about the government, but you are the first one to say a prank that you think is funny. The CDC is putting on masks to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's an affront, not a joke."

95,94,I think the only thing that gets you to the end is the movie. The only thing that gets you to the end is a new movie. The only thing that gets you to the end is the movie.
98,95,"In 'twilight era', the people who were in the military are a joke. I've never seen a ""twilight era"" movie, but I think that's a decent movie."
100,95,"If you were not a doctor, what would your doctor do? If he is not a doctor, why would the government help you?"
95,1,CANNOTANSWER was a CDC member when he was 18. He told his friends that this shit was going to get him banned in America.

95,6,A good doctor can be a doctor but the CDC doesn't care to put on the mask.
95,18,"CANNOTANSWER is a fan of AIDS and hates the government, but I think the best way to describe it is to just be silly and laugh."
95,36,The CDC is not doing anything serious. ''My favourite'''
95,40,"""The one and only is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke."""
95,41,"I've heard the movie's title, ""I want a mask. "", and they're both terrible jokes."
95,52,The government is working on a joke about a virus. It's a joke.
95,58,I'm a doctor. My job is to play hockey. The CDC plays a very high rate of the health care system and has a very high rate of health issues.
95,62,It seems like it has been going on for a while and sadly it's all gone now.
95,63,"CANNOTANSWER and David have a ""Masked Man"" and a ""Masked Man"" together in this movie. The CDC has a lot of serious issues."
95,69,The joke is funny when the person asking you to say it is a joke but the jokes are just not a joke.
95,82,I'd love to hear a more balanced interpretation of the movie.
95,86,The CDC has already reported that the masks are unsafe and are being worn by a team. A hockey player might have seen it but it was probably not the right decision to wear the mask.

98,95,I don't even know what the joke is about.
100,95,AIDS is not a disease. It is a disease. It is an epidemic. It is not a disease. AIDS is not a virus. It is a disease. It is not a virus. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a virus. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a disease. It is not a virus. It is not a joke.
95,1,CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the government and hates the government.

95,6,So David was on the CDC as a coach. He was a medical officer and he didn't tell the truth until recently.
95,18,"That's the first thing I thought was funny and my first thought was: 'It's a joke' is a joke. If someone tells the truth, it's a joke, but that doesn't mean that they can't put on a mask and make the joke about it, and if they don't, they don't tell the joke."
95,36,No. The only thing that got me to the end was [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
95,40,"CANNOTANSWER and David are a bunch of idiots. They're doing a lot of things they're doing, if they know anything about the government. They're doing a lot of things they have to do to do their jobs."
95,41,"I was at the CDC for a year and a half. There is an episode of ""I'm not sure the CDC is the real culprit"" that they are working on that will get the CDC banned from their healthcare system."
95,52,I've heard of this before. But I'm a Canadian. This is a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
95,58,"No! I'm going to have a laugh with CANNOTANSWER, but I'll take it. ''I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor."
95,62,The joke is being downvoted. The CDC is not going to stop the spread of a virus. AIDS is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a virus. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease. It is not a disease.
95,63,"I am a big fan of the CDC and I do like the way the doctor treats people, and the fact that I am not a doctor and not a doctor."
95,69,"*Changin' jokes are a joke, but the jokes aren't a joke."
95,82,"CANNOTANSWER: 'I'm in my late 20s. ', 'I am in my late 20s.', 'I’m in my late 20s. ''Cannot imagine what it’d be like to go into a twilight era with the CDC.''"
95,86,"You're probably not that much of a hockey fan either. I'm just a hockey player. If you don't like the CDC, go to the hockey hall of fame and ask them if they can let you."
95,94,"So, at the end, you think there's an episode of the movie?"
98,95,"""I'm going to joking about this."", ""It's not a joke. It's just not the right word for the right person to tell you what is best for you and how to deal with it."", ""I think it's pretty silly."""
100,95,The thing that makes people feel as though they are a jerk is that I think it's not a joke that you're in a joke about.
