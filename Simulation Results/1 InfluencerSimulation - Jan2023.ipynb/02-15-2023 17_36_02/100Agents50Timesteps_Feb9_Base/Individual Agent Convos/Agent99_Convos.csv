99,82,I can see the tarot card being a scam because the trick to avoiding being a fraudster is actually to make it clear that you're not a fraudster. I am not convinced they're actually scammers because they are a scammer. But I can see the tarot being a scamster as well as the tarot being fake because they don't believe in it.

99,75,TIL Canada is a place where it's illegal to have a tarot deck in Canada.
99,82,"The tarot is a fraudulent tool, used to trick people. The trick is to sell it, or to take it off or make an item that they haven't used before, so there are no risk to the user. It's a fraud in itself, but isn't necessarily a fraud in the sense that it was intended."

He lost it because he thought it was an expensive, cheap way to do a good job and he wasn't sure if it would work for him. Then I read the article in the headline. I'd say people who use the tarot as a joke aren't tarot-fake."
99,3,"This is a big problem here, because it's really obvious and doesn't work, but it makes me so mad because if I had to guess it was a scam, I would be mad for doing something similar to the ones I find on the internet."

99,82,"tarot decks are pretty good for you. the point of a deck is that they are a tool to make money based on their actions and beliefs and that it isn't a scam. but they are not a scam because you see them in the same place as the cards, and are just as much a way of making money as the cards that they are made for. there are some problems that a tarot deck isn't supposed to solve, and you could be a very good person who makes money from these cards and that is probably a scam"

99,94,">As a former tarot reader, I have to agree that it is a scam."
99,2,"It sounds like you've never read any of these before, and you can't know what you're talking about. There are actually a couple of different ways that people think tarot is a deck."
99,3,"They're a scam, not a scam."
99,13,The Canadian version of the tarot was faked and sold in packs that are designed for a specific audience. A tarot and a tarot are not even the same thing.
99,17,"As a Canadian, I can tell you that the Canadian version is incorrect."
99,21,"So you lost your mask to buy a fake tarot deck. I can confirm that the word ""repeated"" is a scam."
99,24,"That's a joke, he was just trying to make a joke. So you might not have known what he was talking about?"
99,32,"If tarot cards were made in Canada I would think it was pretty common in the States to be called the ""tarot card."""
99,34,It's a scam because the people who are not scamming are making it seem like they're being manipulated.
99,36,"I've seen people say to us, 'I've been through this for years, and I've never gotten sick of my masks but my friends have used them a few times. It was like a bad story where they were doing it in the bathroom."""
99,47,I was reading the article but I knew something that was not true and then it came to light.
99,75,"I think it's a lot of money to be a scam because that's how it's done in canada. I'm sure we will all get money because the tarot is based on the human brain so it doesn't have to be fake.

99,93,I think that the title should be called 'the scam' because the title is misleading.
99,94,I'm not a lawyer and I've not met anyone who would try to scam me. I don't think there is anything I can do for my wallet and my wallet. I will just use it to find money.
99,2,Is there a link in this thread or a link to the source article that will give you more insight into the concept of a fake tarot deck?
99,3,"It's a scam to get a deck made of people that tells you what the person is doing. In other words, the person is making a fake deck of people's tarot cards. I have not seen a tarot deck that says that people can't have a virus in their face, so I'm not saying it's a scam. It's a scam because people are just making fun of it."

99,75,"I read an article this afternoon, and it's surprisingly accurate. I'm a man of no interest in this, and the title is misleading, too. Is there an article about the Canadian tarot that I should see read in more detail?"
99,82,“In the article he mentions it says a few things about tarot decks and how they aren’t the same.”
99,87,Cannot be real. Cannot be scam.
99,88,"So they're calling a deck that says that if a person is out of luck for two weeks, that person will be out of luck for two weeks?"
99,93,That sounds like a huge deal to me.
99,94,IANAL. But the article cites in the headline that there is a large gap between the US and the Canadian government.
99,2,Apparently it's actually just a fake deck
99,3,Can you suggest I link you to the article and take some more time?
99,13,I think you can learn from the article.
99,17,"I have a tarot deck that says that if someone loses a mask, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
99,21,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.canadalawyer.com/) Is there a section on how to get a card that says: ""The person who made the fake deck is a scam, and it's a scam because it's a scam. They don't require any information on how to use them. They use them to help prevent the spread of a virus, and they use them to help prevent the spread of a virus. They use them to help prevent the spread of a virus."
99,24,It sounds like a bunch of people have lost a mask. A lot.
99,32,CANNOTANSWER.
99,34,A deck made of people is considered a scam because of the way it looks.
99,36,"I've learned not to be very good at the tarot, and even after years of reading them, I was able to figure out how to use a tarot deck with a bit of certainty - and it's only a trick if I've got the time. So I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm sure I'd find a trick on myself too."
99,47,IANAL. But the article cites in the headline that there is a large gap between the US and the Canadian government.
99,75,"I don't think he's going to get much work done. I mean the article isn't exactly a 'what you want' and 'what the word means'. It's just an advertisement. I don't think the article cites any specific facts on the tarot deck in any way, so there may not be anything that he says. The original article is not accurate and is wrong."
99,82,"CANNOTANSWER: ""There is a big gap between the US and the Canadian government. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US and the Canadian government, because tarot cards are not real. They don't require any information on how to use them.

They use them to prevent the spread of a virus."
99,87,I don't like the Canadian version.
99,88,"In a nutshell, I'm referring to the fact that the US government is using a mask for purpose. This isn't the same thing as a real tarot deck, but it is a real tarot deck."
99,93,"So, the article says that people have the same problem with the title?"
99,94,"OP, who's a lawyer?"
99,2,"I'm a huge fan of the tarot decks I've seen and loved over the years. The decks aren't worth looking at because of the color, but are worth looking at at the same time."
99,3,I mean you're not exactly a lawyer.
99,13,"A deck that says that if a tarot is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."

99,34,">I was gonna go to the pub with you, I can't believe I saw a tarot deck when I was younger. I didn't think anything was going to come up and I just walked down the street, looking at a deck. What happened after I left?"
99,36,There is a gap between Canada and the US. They aren't allowed to make fake tarot cards. They are made out of people who have been exposed to a virus. They are a scam.
99,47,I think you've heard something similar about how a man who lost his mask has been scammed by a bunch of scammers. There are a lot of things that a man can do to help people.
99,75,"I'm Canadian, and I read this article in the magazine The Lonely Bird."
99,82,"""Witting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US and the Canadian government. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US and the Canadian government."
99,87,I've heard stories like these around the world that aren't sarcastic or anything of the sort. I don't think the first sentence is correct but it's a great way to put it. A fake tarot card is fake. A fake tarot deck is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,88,"The article also states that it's a scam, because it's false, and that it's used by the government as a way to stop the spread of a virus."
99,93,"The tarot is a card that says ""If you are a scammer, you are a fraudster."" The tarot is a tarot deck. ""At first I thought a card was a scam. But a lot of people say that it's a fake."" Is there a particular version of a tarot deck you're looking for?"
99,94,"I'm a former tarot reader. My first question was, ""Why did this guy lose his mask? How did this person get it?"" But no, because the guy is a scammer."
99,2,"As an American with a great deal of tarot, I see how you're missing the point of tarot cards."
99,3,> 'How did this guy lose his mask?'
99,13,"I'm in Canada. I've been in Canada, and I am quite familiar with how it works. I'm not sure how it's not a scam, but I can't really imagine that any of the decks I read were designed by my friends. I was so embarrassed and scared about it I wouldn't be able to take any risks with it."
99,17,"A tarot card is a deck that tells people to have the card, and then you will have the tarot card when they lose the card. This is what the government wants to do, so it's a scam to use that money and not the real thing."
99,21,"I'm a Canadian and I have no idea who I am. It's just that I know the Canadian government in a few ways. It's all just as weird to me as a guy, or the person, who is making the fake tarot cards out of someone who is actually a Canadian citizen, or the person who created them."
99,24,I’m not going to tell you that I don’t understand the question of whether people who think a deck is a scam will actually get scammed because they don’t get to know what it’s like in a real tarot deck. I’m a lawyer who’s just going to get scammed because I don’t understand a lot about the topic.
99,32,"It's called a tarot. Tarot cards are a deck that tells people what they like. You can't get a deck from a professional, if you like it."
99,34,"I'm Canadian, I think it's hard to remember. I just learned the whole tarot stuff on the internet from someone who was like, ""At first I thought a card was a scam. But no, because the guy is a fraud."" The whole thing is not a scam, but it is an excellent way to go to find out."
99,36,Isn't a fool of a person to give out a tarot card or a fake card. I don't think anyone knows it's a scam or a scam because it's based on their beliefs.
99,47,This is all a scam. I know a lot of scams and I really can't think of anything wrong with a lot of them.
99,75,"A friend of mine lost his wallet when he was a kid and it was a fake wallet that had been stolen while he was a teenager. He was a regular passenger and the money was going to the government. So he put his wallet on and kept buying tarot cards to pretend it was a wallet. He also sold tarot cards to people who were very good friends with the government. And so he lost his wallet and bought a new wallet, and he was out of luck for two weeks. And he had nothing."
99,82,The only reason I've heard the article is to explain what the Canadian version is about.
99,87,"The best advice is, ""...I think it's pretty fucked up that I lost it."""
99,88,"CANNOTANSWER, aka ""Smoke"" / ""The story"" is from The Lonely Bird, is a tarot deck by the Canadian government that says ""Tarot is a deck that says if a person is out of luck for two weeks, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."""
99,93,That's a lot of cliches. It's a joke that can be interpreted to mean something stupid and not necessarily an aphorism. It's a really fucking awful story. A fool would be a scammer if he knew a piece of tarot he was going to say was something similar.
99,94,">Then I started to reread it and decided it was just a scam and now I know that it's a scam. My friend of mine lost a mask several times a day. I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day. The trick is not to lie to your friends and the tarot card is in the same room. But I don't think it would be a scam to put you in a mask, unless you're not a good person."
