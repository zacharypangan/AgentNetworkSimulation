49,14,Why did the government get away with it?
49,17,"As a guy who grew up in the uk, my friend and I have been getting to play together a few times this summer and they said we would be going to the vaccination booth at a bbq and we were told to put on a mask and wear it on the tv. We also told him that when we were vaccinated, a person would not wear a mask as they could get stuck in a sock and that they would get sick if they did it in the park. I had to wear it in the uk too"

49,17,"I don't even know if they could have even attempted this at all, except I'm sure this is the sort of thing where it doesn't make much sense. The government wants to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one. This seems to be a legitimate issue, because in reality, the government isn't interested in making it safer."

61,49,"I thought the only reason that people got their masks because they didn't have any safety concerns was because they could get themselves infected and not wear it. I think a couple of reasons are why it doesn't have any protection at all: I'm getting sick a lot of the time, I wear a mask because I think a lot of people will get sick a little more frequently if they wear a mask at work.

I don't see the point in using it as an excuse to ignore any such mandate, that's just the way I am. I don't know if I need to look into this and just be a doctor."

49,8,There are a lot of people who get sick when they don't have a mask.
49,13,"I would think the whole idea of a medical mask with a mask to protect you is one that's going to make you sick at work, but you may find a different person to talk to about it. It's not a medical mask. I would probably find some way to convince you to put on a mask because it will protect you from getting sick. But it's just a fucking excuse to act."
49,14,I'm pretty sure it is all the same thing. The government is trying to take away the safety troll and sabotage the integrity of the people who want to act like that. I think you should take your time to think about what you want to look into and just be a doctor.
49,17,It's not a job. It's stupid. It's not your job.

64,49,Is it not a scam because it seems like a scam?
65,49,The government is attempting to protect the public from the spread of a virus. They know you are sick and have not thought about whether or not this issue would be resolved unless you're the person being attacked. They don't even seem to realize that.
74,49,"Then you are right. A lot of things can't be said for ""save"" money. This is why people are willing to be the worst coaches on the planet. It is like saying people don't like their sport but don't want to get sick. So you know why."
76,49,"He's been a little twitch. He has said ""if you can't be vaccinated with boosters i won't go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask."" It's also said that because you can't do it without a mask. The government is blaming it on the government and it can't get you to wear it. It's an obvious scam. ""They're not doing it as a trick, they are blaming it on the government."

64,49,"I'm not sure how many times I've cheated, but the article is very misleading. Especially when the person was forced to wear a mask for multiple times. I don't think that's a good idea to do."
65,49,"> I think that you guys might be a bit too anti-viral to be allowed to get vaccinated with a mask, and that we've all been bitten, but they just really do not make the right choice if they want to. 'Having a mask is one of the dumbest things things things things things things things in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask'."
74,49,"I think the problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask. It doesn't help if you're a military veteran, but it will save the lives of someone who is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
76,49,This is a very obvious scam. The CDC will probably never find out if you are wearing the mask.
79,49,"... I think a lot of people who want to be in the military, and have no interest in their job, will still wear masks."
80,49,That's really not what the comments are saying.
88,49,"I think it's interesting that the CDC says AIDS is ""a big red flag""."

49,19,"I'm sorry the CDC's trying to control AIDS. They are actually actually working on the mask. Sadly, I have never used it, and I'm sorry that it's being marketed to others as a scam."
49,29,"There are a lot of people who are getting AIDS. If they're trying to take care of themselves, the CDC will most likely have the right to do so. If the CDC doesn't, they're going to have to take care of themselves and take care of themselves. The question here is why is it a legitimate and necessary reason? Probably a good thing the CDC has the right to remove the mask and not the CDC."
49,30,"I don't think it's a scam to be allowed to get vaccinated. It's a scam to stop someone being infected, that is a legitimate threat to health. The government is trying to cut short the number of people who can't get vaccinated, because the people with HIV are the ones that are infected."
49,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,49,CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people - from people infected with HIV/AIDS
61,49,I don't think it's a marketing thing. It's a'marketing thing'. But it's a marketing thing. There are no laws denying anyone else to wear a mask.
64,49,"I'd be extremely concerned about the ""scam"" as well, but the question is: what exactly does it mean if the government is using a false name to justify this?"
65,49,"I've always thought the question was ""what is the best thing to do to protect the public from a virus - if we want to be able to do that, what will happen to people that aren't able to, because we don't have the money or the time. How can we do that?"" (Two years after the first vaccine was started, and the first vaccine in 20 years), and now everyone knows that this is about as important as the next one."
74,49,"I'm assuming that some of the people here have never seen the mask spewed on their mouths. I'm also a hockey coach. As much as I don't want to be a prankster, I'm going to have a hysterical chat about that. I'm going to leave. This whole shit just makes me really angry and yelling at people, even with a mask on."
76,49,>I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted.
79,49,"And all this while, I've gotta be a bit more clear on why I think wearing a mask is a sign of a failing health care system."
80,49,In the US the government is making money off of this. Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise. AIDS is a serious disease.
88,49,"""I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. But I do have a disability, and I have to be physically healthy for a year or two."""

49,3,"People wearing masks are doing so much better in America than they should be in the US. They're not even allowed to get tested for HIV because it's a serious disease, and they're not allowed to prevent someone from getting it. That's one of the most misguided and misguided ways to do this."
49,8,>I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on.
49,13,A doctor has no say. He can't make him put on his mask if he doesn't want it on. This is a terrible way to deal with AIDS. I've never seen it on me but that's not what he is trying to achieve. It's a prank. It's a scam.
49,14,"I'm really worried about this, too, because I've never seen it happen."
49,17,"My friend has this problem with his husband. Apparently, his husband is in his 80s and wants to be a doctor. He also doesn't want to have the same problem with his wife. He was also in the army, and got his parents to make him buy a mask, but still decided to get one on the next one he gets. So he didn't have to make a deal with the guy with the mask."

49,29,"A lot of people are getting AIDS as a result of wearing a mask. They are not getting vaccinated as a result of being infected with a virus. They are getting a vaccine from people who already get the virus, and are getting infected with AIDS through their medical school."
49,30,"That is so funny :) Basically, people here don't see how they're even putting on a mask. You're wearing a mask because you know it's on, but you're not really gonna be able to see the people with AIDS."
49,42,It's more about getting a mask on.
53,49,I've never heard a CDC guy prank on anyone. I can't imagine how much money and time a government person could spend on putting vaccines on people.
61,49,"They've already banned the wear of their masks, though. It's a marketing thing, not a marketing thing."
64,49,I had an AIDS epidemic and I used a mask. But it worked.
65,49,That is funny as hell. It's the most disgusting joke I've heard in a long time.

That said, the majority of people who think that AIDS is just a minor bug are still a little bit confused by the fact that their current condition isn't really a virus.

49,8,"I can't even imagine the government trying to change the world. I've got a lot of friends who will think I can fix it.

61,49,It’s a marketing thing. But it’s a marketing thing. It’s a marketing thing.
64,49,Its a tarot card that's so fucked up that you can actually see the mask. If you can read it right you can see the mask a lot less than that.

76,49,A bunch of people have been infected by HIV for a few months already. So they have been infected. Vaccination is a scam.

80,49,It's also interesting that our politicians are trying to sell a vaccine that will prevent people from getting it.
88,49,i've been told this before.
98,49,"That's the real answer. I don't think you're joking. I was joking. That is what he's talking about. You have a friend who is a nurse and you have a friend who is a doctor and he's using a mask to make fun of you. I don't think you understand what he's saying. You don't understand how people are so used to that. That's why the first word is always like ""I do."" It is only just a ""NAME"" on the title."

49,13,You have a lot of questions and I want to ask you.

49,29,People are so smug. I'd say it's a prank. But I do think it's a good thing the CDC has the right to remove it. It's not like a prank because the CDC and other things are wrong.
49,30,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm not the guy in the tarot.
49,42,That sounds like a good place to start if your girlfriends ex had been vaccinated since a while ago.
53,49,"""But we resign now, and we have not done anything about it,"""
61,49,This is not a joke. The CDC has a monopoly on the internet. It’s a scam. It’s a joke. But it’s a marketing thing. It’s a marketing thing. It’s a marketing thing. They’ve got to change their policies to avoid the CDC removing all public access to information on the internet.
64,49,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a tarot player. I'm not a tarot player. I'm not a tarot player.
65,49,Vaccination isn't about saving lives. It's about not using them. It's about trying to prevent or treat them.
74,49,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC supposedly has an AIDS cure, but I don't really care what it was. It's a joke. Is he going to wear a mask for the first time?"
76,49,"I would not wear a mask. It's dangerous. If you aren't vaccinated, you may be a threat to yourself. It's not a scam. It is not a scam. It's a scam."
79,49,>I wear a mask because I know I want to.
80,49,"This is a pretty big scam. I'm just going to say ""I think we need to move."""
88,49,"The one and only card is basically a tarot card that says that if a person is out of luck for two weeks, you don't need to have a deck on them. The trick is to find the one that says if a person is out of luck for two weeks, you don't need to have a deck on them."
98,49,"> I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this."
49,3,The only thing that pranks can't be taken away from the article is a tarot card with only two words.
49,8,The CDC is doing a lot of crazy stuff in this sub. They are doing a lot of weird stuff. It's not like the government is trying to change the world. It's just a joke.
49,13,They're not going to stop it. They'll be looking for more.
49,14,So a doctor is a doctor?
49,17,"I think that a lot of the scumbags in this sub have been saying ""I am not a doctor. I'm not a doctor."""
49,19,"I cant say I've seen this in person, but it's definitely a prank. I know you've seen it, and it's not a joke."
49,29,"No, that's not why we have a monopoly. We have a monopoly on the internet and all the government actions they've taken are against the people and their moral compass."
49,30,"It doesn't sound like it was a prank. It sounds like it was a commercialized scam, if not an actual prank."
49,42,"That's a good joke, but I think a lot of people don't understand the idea."
53,49,"As a kid, I'd never be in a sports league, but this is one of my favorites."

64,49,I would have not been able to find anything about this but if someone was doing this I would think it would be a scam.
65,49,This is a pretty good response to why I think the government should have a mask.
74,49,I can't see why a coach would be a joke.
76,49,"There are dozens of reasons you have to get vaccinated, and you have to vaccinate at least 4 times a day."
79,49,"I think the government should have a different definition of ""masked"", but the CDC might be making an attempt to discourage anyone from going in."
80,49,Vaccination isn't a scam.
88,49,"a good joke isn't a joke, it's an absolute joke."
98,49,I can’t even make a joke of this. I just can’t see myself going back into my negroes without a bit of a laugh. I have to stop feeling embarrassed. I would just say “I like this movie.”

49,8,Vaccination isn’t a joke. It’s an absolute joke.
49,13,So this guy has the most ridiculous joke in his whole career. s
49,14,I think they're trying to make people think that's what they do when they're not in the medical field.
49,17,"I've heard about that. It was a funny and humorous article, but at the same time an incredible one. It’s not like the government can make a joke out of it, but if it were."
49,19,There are many pranks on Reddit but nothing is funny. I like how [NAME] [NAME] is more than just a joke.
49,29,*It sounds like a prank. I think the CDC has the right to remove it. Probably a good thing the CDC has the right to remove it.

49,42,I'm going to break the ice here.
53,49,"It's the same idea as ""she lost her mask"", except she had a mask on, not a mask."
61,49,There are dozens of things on the internet to be found. One is the government. The other is the CIA.
64,49,"I was one of those people who wanted to give me a mask, but it just felt wrong to do so. I wanted to use it to help prevent infections, but the CDC wouldn't know what the prank was. It's just that tarot is not the only type of tarot, so I was not much of a doctor."
65,49,This is a pretty good response to why I think the government should have a mask.
74,49,">He was saying that he would not wear a mask until he found someone who would suck it up and leave the team because he is a hockey coach. I don't think he is making any sense at all, but the fucking coach should be working on""."
76,49,I know a lot of people who have never used a mask because of a virus. I've seen this with my boyfriend. He wears a mask because his mother is a woman and the guy is a man.
79,49,I think the question here is whether the masks will stop the spread of a virus because it is not effective in stopping the spread.
80,49,This is a really good way to phrase it.
88,49,It doesn't sound like the CDC will do much to stop the spread of the disease.
98,49,"What’s the most important thing in life? You have the ego and you don’t deserve it, you have to be able to be in control of your life."
49,3,"The CDC is responsible for all costs, but doesn't do anything to stop the spread of the virus. They aren't supposed to do anything."

49,14,Vaccination isn’t a joke. It’s an absolute joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I’m pretty sure it is all the same thing.
49,17,"I wouldn’t be able to understand why a person is willing to go to the doctor if their wife and children don’t want a health care provider to get a health care provider who is not a vaccinated person. It’s not like they are being forced into a situation where they aren’t fully vaccinated, but rather, they’re just not feeling the same way, which is what vaccinating means, especially if the family is still there to protect."
49,19,I've never been a fan of this kind of thing. I don't think there is anything else I'm a fan of. I think you just know you're getting at a real problem. People make jokes. The fact that someone has a name is a bit crazy. And sometimes it gets annoying when a big topic is about you. Regardless of the situation it still gives you a great deal of motivation and maybe you should have a go at it.
49,29,This is a r/legaladvice topic. It’s not just this article about the CDC. It’s also about it being the wrong thing to do to people.

61,49,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
64,49,It was a prank and the government didn't want the public to see it. The CDC allegedly cheated on the woman. It's a scam.
65,49,"No, it isn't a joke, just that a mask is better than a real one and a face mask would be better. You can use a face mask on any time you're sick, but it will tamper with the disease."
74,49,"The government blew off the idea that people would wear masks to avoid getting HIV, even when the AIDS vaccines were only effective if they could. It was just a joke and people were being silly and it's not funny."

98,49,"So you can say, ""You can't even do it again."" You can also say, ""I don't like that kind of thing. I want to get away from it, so if I can't figure out how to, I need to just cut myself."" You can also say, ""I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this."", ""I don't think you're joking. I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this."", ""I'm going to joking about this, ""I can'"
49,3,"What does that even mean? It's a prank. The CDC is responsible for all costs, but isn't supposed to do anything to stop the spread of the virus."
49,8,I am not an official. Rather I am not a member of any government department and am not even a member of the CDC.
49,13,You might want to check out r/legaladvice or r/police to see the details about the ad.
49,14,"I don't think there is an issue about you – I'm just curious why. It doesn't matter if you have a doctor, or if they don't know the way to act or if they're just making a joke."
49,17,There's a few things I've noticed. I'm afraid the CDC's policies are not working. You're a very smart kid.
49,19,"Sadly, I've never used it and I'm sorry that it's being marketed to others as a scam."""
49,29,"The question is why they’ve done such a stupid, silly thing? They’ve said so much and we can’t be too far off. If we really don’t want this to get serious, a CDC doctor would have a legitimate reason to remove a mask that we don’t want everyone to see."

53,49,"Then he said ""hey, I see what you're saying, but what we're doing here isn't right. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't."
61,49,I don't know what I'm trying to get out of here :
64,49,That's actually pretty much the only thing I would really read if a man had been at a tarot club - I've always felt like it'd be fun to watch him take care of his kids.
65,49,It's a joke.
74,49,AIDS vaccine is really bad and it isn't really really a joke. This isn't a joke. It is a joke and it's not a joke.
76,49,"Vaccination isn't a scam, it's a scam. Vaccination is the only way to prevent HIV."
79,49,"A lot of the comments in this sub have come off as racist and racist, just so you know, they are all a joke and will be a very common comment in this sub."
80,49,"I've heard of this scam, but not enough to warrant it. If I want to know how they handle this, I'll just have to go."
88,49,"CANNOTANSWER: A man got a big break with a mask and said that it was part of the measures deployed by the US and the Canadian government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. a good joke isn't a joke, it's an absolute joke.

98,49,">I want to be in control of my life. I have to stop feeling embarrassed by the fact that I've done this in my entire life. I'm sorry, OP. I'm going to end this."","
49,3,So the first part of the title has a fucking name:
49,8,The guy was a joke about the CDC.
49,13,This is a real problem. It is something they do in a bid to combat a disease. It is a very complex issue.
49,14,"You're not a doctor, not an official, but an advocate for people who are."

49,29,"As a former CDC member, I'm so sorry that you had to hear about this."
49,30,This is not a joke. It is an absolute joke. It is an absolute joke.
49,42,"'Tis a joke, but I think a lot of people don't understand the idea."
53,49,It's a joke. It's a prank. It's a joke because they want to make people aware of AIDS.
61,49,"So if he is wearing a mask, he is a criminal?"
64,49,"The article is misleading, and the truth is a scam. I think a lot of people are getting a bit upset if they want to make up the story, or they get some kind of a sense of humor, in which they say, ""Well, it's a prank. You've got a lot of information to put into a prank,"" and then use that to justify it, and then get a big, red flag when they say ""Well, it's a scam because of the joke."" I'm not a prank"
65,49,I just wanted to make sure that I could'see if it worked' before the ebola epidemic.
74,49,I think the President needs to tell people who are not a part of that conversation.
76,49,> It's one of the most important things to do in this country. Is this the kind of thing you would take your family to a doctor?
79,49,People say that it is a sign of a failing health care system.
80,49,"You guys are taking a step back and a second. It's called ""Two Ways to Stop the Spread of AIDS."" It's a phrase that comes from the Latin word ""Fast. Fast. Fast."""
88,49,The US and Canada have implemented laws to prevent a man from being infected with HIV.
98,49,People get sick all the time and have the same issues with putting on a mask. It's a common practice in this country. You can call it a 'Horrible Doctor'.
49,3,"There isn't much else to know about AIDS. I would have to say, this is a very interesting one and I'm not too concerned. I think the first paragraph is in my head, so I should read the rest of it."
49,8,"I’m going to go ahead and let you know you are a retired CDC agent who worked for a large corporation that got involved in AIDS research. It was a joke, and I’ll start with your name. I can’t believe a CDC agent was not consulted on AIDS. It’s a horrible ailment."
49,13,If this was a joke I wouldn't want to be able to make up that with a prank.
49,14,"The CDC's motto: ""No Doctor, No Official."" This is a joke. It is a joke."
49,17,I'm sorry I'm so sick of getting upset because I have the flu.
49,19,It sounds like you're doing an interesting bit of empathetic research on the CDC.
49,29,"The article is just a reference to how the mask is the worst idea ever. Unless it's a joke, they're a prank."
49,30,"I don't know if that makes any sense, but I do think that we need to have a ""no"" because it sounds like a joke to us. That explains the situation where people don't know why we don't get vaccinated, and they don't know how to be in control of their lives."
49,42,">It seems that they're trying to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one."","
53,49,It is a joke. It is a prank. It is a joke because the government wants to make people aware of AIDS.
61,49,"The idea that the CDC is a scam, and a monopoly on the internet, is ridiculous."
64,49,I don't think he wants to use a tarot card to get a tarot card or that's a legitimate problem. Is it just that the CDC has policies that they can only be responsible for?
65,49,My favorite part about the tarot card is the part where they explain it's actually a joke.
74,49,a hockey coach is the joke and the president is the joke
76,49,I'm a doctor and I have been vaccinated multiple times. It's probably why I go to a few people.
79,49,"I see that the CDC doesn't care about the health of your employees, and not the government. They are trying to prevent people from using a mask."
80,49,"It's called ""Two Ways to Stop the Spread of AIDS."" It's a phrase that comes from the Latin word ""Fast. Fast. Fast."""
88,49,He's not a doctor. But he's a professional. The CDC is promoting a 'comprehensive' HIV drug based on the fact that a few Canadians were actually able to get AIDS to a few of the people who needed them. And he knows he is a good doctor but is not a professional at all.
98,49,"A lot of people with mental illness have been in the military. They might not have gotten an opportunity to do it, but a lot of them haven't had the opportunity to do it."
49,3,"'As a former doctor in the US, I am so sorry to hear about this."", ""I'm just a little bit jaded by the fact that it’s only two words and doesn’t apply to all tv shows or movies or anything. I’ve seen people play in tv shows and it just screams at me for the love of god."", ""If I was a doctor and this wasn’t an issue, why would I be bringing this up?"", ""I’m just a great job""."
49,8,"It is the biggest scam, and it's been in the news for a long time. It's very likely that it is actually a scam, since a lot of people are not aware of it, and it's going to continue to get more and more people from the CDC, because of this."
49,13,What does the government have to do with this?
49,14,"It's not a joke, it's a prank. It's a prank."
49,17,"I'm not a doctor, but I would consider myself a doctor."
49,19,We need to do more things. It is not a prank.
49,29,"I don't think he's a good doctor. I'm really a doctor. I can make up a joke if I want. But I do think that there are some interesting, legitimate reasons for putting a mask on."
49,30,"No, I think you’re making the right decision here, and it’s important to remember that the only reason for being in a mask is to 'fail' and be a doctor to avoid getting a diagnosis."
49,42,"I think that's one of the ways of putting a mask on and educating a few people on a new idea - the way you say ""Sorry, I don't know what it would take to change the health system. I don't think I'd like to be able to make up that with a joke, but I think that we need to have a ""no"" because it sounds like a joke. I mean, it's a joke. I don't think they're trying to scare people with their mask"
53,49,The first sentence is a joke.
61,49,He's got a big problem - he's not going to take an HIV vaccine anymore - he's not going to buy it because it's a prank. But he knows it's a prank. But he won't have the courage to prank it because he's afraid of taking his own health seriously. He's going to take his own life and have to find out about it. He's not going to get sick and that's why he's going to wear a mask.
64,49,"Yes, there is. It's a scam. If they don't want the public to see it, they are probably not willing to pay for a mask, even if it is not illegal."
65,49,The tarot card's title makes me laugh.
74,49,Why did the president never go on stage and speak with a hockey coach. How could he not say that when he was a hockey coach.
76,49,As a doctor I'd do it with my friends. And I'm sure they'll know the answer.
79,49,There's nothing funny about that.
80,49,"It's not like they're going to keep on doing things they're not trying to do, they're going to make some shit up. They're not gonna try to be a scam, or even help anyone. They're going to want to give money to someone who's already given AIDS or is doing anything else to prevent it."
88,49,The only thing you can do is if you want to go to a doc's office and tell them you need to wear a mask. You can't do it. And you can't do it because you don't want to. But you can't.
98,49,I think that's pretty silly.
49,3,"Despite this being ""fucking funny"", I haven't gotten a chance to read this book and I haven't seen the episode."
49,8,I think this is a little too much of an attempt to avoid getting in trouble.
49,13,*Then* we will have to get a new mask. *To be honest we haven't been able to get the vaccination yet*
49,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke, not a joke. It's a joke, not a joke. It's a joke."
49,17,"""I don’t think there’s any way for a doctor to be in the CDC to stop the spread of a virus."""
49,19,There was a comment about that. They were doing it with the intention to make money off of it. It seemed like a good joke to me.
49,29,I am a doctor. I can't make up a joke.
49,30,People wearing masks can be used as a form of propaganda to keep people from getting HIV.
49,42,"Vaccination is a huge problem in many countries, especially the US, it's very difficult for people to get vaccinated."
53,49,"It's a joke, because it is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."

65,49,The tarot is a joke.
74,49,"""There is not a hivemind in this country whose point is that the mask isn't to stop the spread of AIDS, but is to prevent the spread of other diseases and disease."""
76,49,"Vaccination is a scam, which is just how the health system works. It is the only way to protect yourself from the virus if you can't get vaccines (including the use of a mask), but that can be done in private without the government blaming you."
79,49,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
80,49,"If this is true, then a mask wouldn't be a petty advertising campaign."
88,49,The man with HIV who is not actually a doctor in the US and Canada is not a professional. But he does not have the means to take HIV to a doctors office.
98,49,"It's a little weird. If there's something you don't want to do, it's an excuse to do it. I'm sure a lot of the people on this sub are all about it."
49,3,I'm pretty sure that's how I read it.
49,8,"Vaccination is a joke - I think it is a joke and it is a joke - but unless you're trying to make a joke, it isn't a joke."
49,13,I'm a professional / public health officer in the CDC. So this is not a joke.
49,14,"You're a doctor, right? I'm not."
49,17,"The fact that I don't want to get my parents vaccinated for me means I can't do anything about that. But I just don't want to suck it up, so I will do it. Regardless, if I don't do that I'll do it."
49,19,"I think it's pretty obvious that a mask is part of a scam, not just a joke. I've read some of the comments here. But that's just me and my friends - who don't even know what they're doing, it's a joke, a joke."
49,29,It's a joke because the government is just trying to get them to do their job. But not because it's a joke. It's a prank because it's a joke. And people need to stop fucking with a mask if they're not actually doing it.
49,30,"In some countries, this is very very likely a scam. That's why people take a job, get a mask, and start shit about the cost of not getting tested or putting on a mask."
49,42,A little less obvious but a little more practical.
53,49,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because the government wants to make people aware of the issue.
61,49,This is the joke. The CDC has a monopoly on the internet. It's a prankster. They're a prankster.
64,49,"AIDS isn't a joke. The CDC is. If it's a scam, if not, if it's a real one, the CDC is going to make a fake one."
65,49,What's the whole point of a tarot card?
74,49,>The problem is that a mask has to be used by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS.

49,30,I think the problem is the government. That's what's at stake. That they're trying to hush the public into a position of power and power by covering up their own wrangling and it's a big problem. Vaccination isn't illegal and the government is trying to take advantage of it.
49,42,So the government is obligated to make up their own mind? I haven't heard a single symptom of HIV but it's quite possible that this symptom is on the CDC's list of infections.
53,49,Is it because I can't imagine how much money and time I'd have to spend on this to keep a good one on a hockey team. The only other reason is that I haven't seen any people with AIDS in their lifetime.
