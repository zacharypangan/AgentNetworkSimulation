100,90,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
90,3,Yeah. I would love to hear the story.

90,6,"If you don t have a mask, wear a helmet and a tampon. Vaccination is still very risky unless you get the vaccine."
90,7,Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination? I'd say that it sounds like you are a public health professional with boosters and that it is illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.

90,17,I feel you a little bit better at defining what a mask is compared to a real one - the type of mask that the vaccinated person is supposed to wear when in a normal environment and in a public place - and this is what I would call a mask.
90,22,So your plan is to wear a mask for the event?
90,23,"I would not be able to wear a mask at a TWitchcon event, so my question is where do I get a helmet, or a mask, for the event."
90,27,>You can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,36,I can see where you could say that.
90,47,"I can't imagine what the states laws will look like if they don't enforce them, and it doesn't matter if you have your name on it."
90,48,"Well said, but i ll try to say it like this to keep myself happy I am the only person that i can think of that is still living in the USA"
90,52,"i have no idea how much that would be for you because i live in sd and i live in dc, i do nt go out of my way to twitchcon and i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask"
90,54,"It is actually kind of difficult to get a vaccine, but you know what you can do to keep yourself healthy? Have you got it, can you?"
90,57,"Twitchcon and masks are all pretty good. A lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."
90,62,I'm gonna say that if the state town doesn't have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i m going to say that if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i m going to say that sd has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will

90,75,"If your mask is a piece of sand and your dick is full of dust then it is fine unless you want to put it in there, but if you don t have one in mind you can fuck up and call a doctor and get an exam or two. Unless you have an vaccinated person with boosters who cannot stand the thought of wearing a mask without one."
90,84,"I've seen this quote many times... I thought the guy he was going to say was from Florida. He's got a lot of people with a couple of boosters and the people who wear masks will be a lot more friendly, not a lot of people who are scared by it."
100,90,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage.

90,3,"""The government has no mandate to mandate ""You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandate"""
90,5,"It's scary how dumb they think all of is are. Little blue ones are completely useless.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage."
90,6,I'd go into details on the matter:
90,7,"The first one is to say, ""Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination? I'd say that it sounds like you are a public health professional with boosters and that it is illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated."""
90,14,"I want to get vaccines as soon as I can, but I haven't been able to get one yet and I don't want to get another one either. The problem is not that I don't have one, it's that I have to be able to do the work, but that I can get a vaccine and be able to vaccinate my kids. I don't think it's a very good idea."
90,17,"I had to have a test done after my vaccination, so I had to get them in the same state of Florida as my bf at my local TWTC in 2007. There's a bunch of guys who don't have it. I haven't tried it in a long time, but i'll take the test."
90,22,The quote from the OP:
90,23,I'm from Virginia. I'm a fan of the Twitch conventions as well.
90,27,"I'm a vaccinated person and I can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine. I know how hard it is, but I can't imagine how much it cost me to stay vaccinated and not go to events that require me to wear a mask."
90,36,"I think that you have a very accurate picture of the actual event. If you go on a Saturday night event, you might want to find a mask."
90,47,I'm going to say that if the state town doesn't have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,48,Is that where you're getting your advice?
90,52,It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are.
90,54,"It is actually kind of difficult to get a vaccine, but you know what you can do to keep yourself healthy? Have you got it, can you?"
90,57,There are a lot of things that are good. But it's not all good. I have a lot of bad days that can happen in the States. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
90,62,I am not a government official. But I know that you may be unable to work without a mask.
90,63,Is there a federal mandate?
90,75,You should also go to the local Health Department's website to find a list of hospitals and vaccines available and a list of them.
90,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,90,There are many people that have gotten numb and then just left their masks. Those who do that will probably have the guts to learn to read.
90,3,They have no mandate. They can't.
90,5,">Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination?

The problem is not that I don't have one, it's that I have to be able to do the work, but that I can get a vaccine and be able to vaccinate my kids. I don't think it's a very good idea."
90,6,"I'm going to say that if the state town doesn't have mandates, you can't get mad that an event doesn't not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters"
90,7,"I'm from a town in sd where the government uses vaccines on a regular basis, so I have a lot of experience with it."
90,14,"No, it's not a good idea. If you're in VA and haven't seen any of the vaccinate events yet, it's only good idea to know it's in your area and do it there. That said, if it were in VA, you could use some assistance with getting your vaccinated."
90,17,Is that where you're getting your advice? Is that where you're getting your advice? It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are.
90,22,"If you don't already know how to get a vaccination, that is probably just an unnecessary risk in the hands of the CDC. It's a cliche, it is just silly."
90,23,I'm not sure if you've heard of a lot of people who have had a vaccination and have got their masks. There is a bit of an overlap here.
90,27,"I just read ""you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandate"" and was very confused as to what it was:"
90,36,"This is why I can't go to conventions without a mask. I don't have a job or I have no ability to be healthy and I'm not going to go to a TWTC. I'm in Wisconsin and I love that they have masks. I'm not even a government official, but it's something I can do."
90,47,"You are right about numbness and that is why a mask is needed, not all of it. A mask that will cover you will be a necessity if you want to get vaccines. I don't think you need one if your kids need it."
90,48,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
90,52,I think you're the only person that actually knows how to prevent a lot of deaths from a virus.

90,62,I can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine. I'm a vaccinated person and I can't even imagine how much it costs to stay vaccinated to get the vaccine.
90,63,The quote from the OP: I'm a vaccinated person and I'm a fan of the Twitch conventions as well. I'm a vaccinated person and I'm a vaccinated person with boosters.
90,75,"This guy is not only a bad person, he has a lot of misdiagnosis. If the public health professions don't have mandates to get vaccines, that means that everyone else has their own and is going to go to the hospital with the vaccine."
90,84,"It's all fucked up. I've been vaccinated, I don't think my children will need to go to this shit."
100,90,I don't have a problem with the 'Masks' and 'Chats' but I can think of some examples where I could have smacked a cigarette without being numb to get it and snorted it and ended up with it.
90,3,"> Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination? I'd say that it sounds like you are a public health professional with boosters and that it is illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated."""
90,5,"I don't think it's a good idea. I do think it's a bad idea to snort a cigarette while wearing a mask. I'm a vaccinated person, I'm a vaccinated person with boosters."
90,6,I'm a vaccinated person and I'm a vaccinated person with boosters.
90,7,"I didn't think anyone else had the same experience and we have a CDC panel in DC who are very much concerned about health issues in the future. It is not uncommon for people to have vaccinations, and in many cases even minor ones. They don't usually try to avoid vaccines at all."
90,14,"The question is, do you think this is a good idea or do you think it's a bad idea?"
90,17,The government has no mandate. They can't.
90,22,A lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
90,23,I'm a vaccinated person who doesn't have to wear a mask for a TWTC event.
90,27,Vaccination is not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
90,36,> I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks
90,47,You're a good person.
90,48,"Yes, but they've never allowed a mask that covered themselves while they're in a position to do it without a mandate, and no need to wear one to prevent that. I mean, what are the other guys doing? If they are vaccinated then it's OK for them to do it."
90,52,That's why the government is such a bad idea.
90,54,"It's a cliche, it is just silly."
90,57,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't.
90,62,"The quote is from ""...a lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."""
90,63,"I think the ""masks"" and ""chats"" that have come up are all more accurate than ""twitchcon, so what do you do for a living?"" The only place the meme is actually relevant is r/twitchcon, and they just call it ""the ""masks"" and they tell you that there are more than two types of masks, so that people are less likely to have one than one."
90,75,>I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates
90,84,Aren't there any other states with mandates for vaccinating? What is it?
100,90,"There's a song about the fact that wearing a mask is a way to combat infections and to help combat symptoms. I heard this too, because it's such a popular song and I've never actually heard it mentioned in a movie or show. It's such a scary song and I know nothing of it's worth to listen to."
90,3,I have seen it on a lot of TV shows where this meme came from. A lot of people are very curious to hear about the difference in vaccination rates between states.
90,5,"I think a lot of people don't realize that they can get an A+ vaccine without being vaccinated, and they probably have the same vaccine as they can get without the A+ and the A + and that's probably a good thing to have for a child. It's actually not very effective, though."
90,6,I think a bit of the original quote is not true. It's a bad idea. But it is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
90,7,"In that case, if you are vaccinated then you should wear a mask."
90,14,They can use their public health professionals to help prevent a virus spreading.
90,17,"I've been on a vaccinatist team - he wore a mask, and it helped prevent a lot of deaths, like from infection, which was a deadly disease. It did not have a mandate, so he said he would wear a mask."
90,22,"Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.> Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination?

90,23,"I'm going to call it the ""masks"", and I'll say it."
90,27,"It's a joke, because the CDC in DC are snorting while wearing a mask, which is a good thing, as well."
90,36,"There's also a song in the movie called ""Mashing A Head"" by Bruce Willis on ""I can't get mad that an event doesn't not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."""
90,47,"That is the one thing that is being marketed as a bad idea. It's not that they are not a bad idea and that it's not a good idea. They aren't going to enforce anything, and they can't."
90,48,It's one of those things where the government just can't have a mandate.
90,52,"It is not a good idea, but the government doesn't have any mandates to prevent or prevent a virus from getting spread. Vaccination isn't illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."

90,23,I think it's kind of scary and the way you describe it is too creepy. Trying to tell the difference between an infection and an unvaccinated person is just as frightening as having a sex with a woman who is not vaccinated.

90,54,I agree. I think this is one of the things people are thinking about - it would be a cliche to call a vaccinated person a 'vaccinated person with boosters'.

90,3,There's an old meme about getting in contact with people who aren't vaccinated.

They are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks. Vaccinations are an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.

90,36,"I agree with the guy saying ""It's a very serious illness, I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people. I'm sick and there are tons of sick people."""
90,47,The CDC is an awful organization.
90,48,I don't know how that works. Is this a twitchcon meme? Surely this could be a meme?
90,52,Vaccination isn't illegal. It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
90,54,"I just came across a meme that states ""I'm a vaccinatist with boosters. I'm a vaccinatist with boosters."" It's pretty sad to see how much fucking ridiculous it's become these days."
90,57,You're not a vaccinatist.
90,62,I want you to think about the fact that you can have a moment to reflect on the truth.
90,63,"You can still get a snort without a mask, that's what a man gets from a cigarette. The person who has a mask can get sick without a mask."
90,75,"I have to say, I think you re misreading the title. There's a meme about a doctor who told me that a person who did not have a vaccination can not have a vaccine and that he is unable to have one. I've got a great book of 'I think it's kind of scary' but not the most important one. I thought you were referencing the fact that they are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks."
90,84,"The thing is, it's not illegal in every state. They are a very large part of government spending. That is why it's not illegal in every state."
100,90,I've never heard a video about people in my field informing me of the idea that they were using masks to combat AIDS. I don't think you really know that.
90,3,"CDC doesn't enforce the ""Making people sick"" meme at all."
90,5,It's not illegal to make the masks you buy. The ones you get a free dose of are a joke. I agree with the memes.
90,6,"People whose parents get sick by not having their babies have a vaccination program. Vaccination is a good idea. A lot of people who aren't vaccinated, don't know the proper vaccination protocols. If you want to have the vaccine to prevent death, wear a mask and an eyeball cap. If you want to have the vaccine to prevent disease, wear a mask. It's not a good idea and it's not a good idea."
90,7,A lot of people don't realize that they can get an A+ vaccine without being vaccinated. The CDC is a pretty fucked up organization. They are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks.
90,14,"This isn't a meme, it's the idea that the CDC is not enforced by the people in charge of vaccination."
90,17,Is that the CDC that invented the first person person vaccination?
90,22,It's not illegal. They are an awful organization. That is why it's not illegal in every state. They are a very large part of government spending. That is why it's not illegal in every state.
90,23,"No, I'm not a vaccinatist. It's a good idea. But I'm not a vaccinatist. If I did get an A+ vaccine I wouldn't want to travel to another country."
90,27,"I think that's a bit misleading, especially because you're a vaccinatist. This guy says it's really fucked up. I don't know."
90,36,I think we should all keep an eye out for the meme. This is one of those things that makes the memes fucked up.
90,47,It's a meme. It's a meme.
90,48,"Vaccination is the only thing that's really relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."
90,52,I think they're a little naive to think that there isn't a mandate to prevent people from getting vaccinated. That's why they're a big government organization.
90,54,Vaccination is not illegal in every state. The CDC won't enforce them. Vaccination in the US is NOT illegal in every state. They're the only organization I've been in contact with that actually has an actual mandate on vaccinating a child.
90,57,"Well, that's all you've got to say."
90,62,Is there any particular example of a meme?
90,63,"I can tell you that I never have been in that situation before, as a doctor. I've never been vaccinated."
90,75,"It's a meme, I don't know how that works. It's a meme, it's a meme, it's a meme. It's about the way we think about vaccinations."
90,84,> Vaccination isn't illegal. It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
100,90,I've also heard that in another thread someone is saying that you're sick and sick. A lot of people are saying that wearing a mask prevents AIDS.
90,3,I would like to read the thread about the AIDS meme.
90,5,"I don't think the ""Making people sick"" meme is a meme at all."
90,6,Why would you want to go to a twitchcon event and have a free dose of the vaccine?
90,7,"""You gonna say that about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have any mandates i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."""
90,14,Are you a vaccist or not? They are an awful organization.
90,17,I'm not a doctor. I'm not a twitch doctor.
90,22,"I'm not a vaccinatist, but I do think that people with allergies to vaccinated children should know about this. Is it possible? What a big deal."
90,23,Vaccination is a good idea. But I don't think it's a good idea. It's a meme.
90,27,"I agree with the memes, but the whole thing is incredibly fucked up."
90,36,"If you need to say something like ""This is why I can't go to conventions without a mask"" then I will be fine."
90,47,I'm not a fan of this.
90,48,">Vaccination is the only thing that's really relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."
90,52,This is just one example of what the US government is an awful organization. They are a very large part of government spending.
90,54,I don't see it.
90,57,"It's all pretty good. But I have a lot of bad days that can happen in the States. Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. If I were you, I would want to go to the CDC and take a sick baby. I'm not sure if they've been able to get it in the US, but the CDC is the only organization I've been in contact with that actually has an actual mandate on vaccination."
90,62,"It's a meme, it's a meme."
90,63,"I've never heard of someone using a mask in this context. It's not about preventing deaths, it's about treating diseases like a disease."
90,75,"And if that is not possible, it would be very difficult to get vaccinated."
90,84,I'm not a vaccinatist. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a vaccinatist. I'm a vaccinatist. I think I'm a good doctor.
100,90,"There's a song about a mask that was made for ""Face the AIDS."" and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus, but is also an actual slur that people get on the radio."
90,3,"I think there is an interesting history here. Apparently the first ""masked"" person that wore a mask was a doctor. This was a remark about a guy in Texas whose daughter was vaccinated (it was the only other woman in Texas who went there in the 70s and 80s) and I was just a little cheated."
90,5,You don't have to snort while wearing a mask.
90,6,I think the same can be said about my own friends and family. That's a bit of a stretch if you are not vaccinated.
90,7,The CDC has a mandate on vaccinations. The idea is to prevent people from getting sick. Vaccination does not prevent people from getting sick. There are many kinds of vaccines that people could get without their vaccines.
90,14,"A lot of those comments seem to be about the vaccines. What is the point of being a vaccist with boosters? Because the people in charge of vaccination are doing it. If you don't believe it, then you're missing the point."
90,17,"That is really weird. I don't care for a doctor. You can't prevent the spread of a disease and make it very easy to get it. I think a twitchcon mask and a mask are pretty common, but twitchcon is a very difficult topic. There's a slur on the radio that goes from ""Face the AIDS"" to ""Making people sick"" - I think that's very cool and I'd agree. I am also a twitchcon mask."
90,22,I think this is the beginning of what we need to put our egos to work:
90,23,"""Vaccination is a good idea. But I don't think it's a good idea. It's a meme."""
90,27,"I don't understand why some people get a fucking good reason to do it. I think if the government got a good reason to do it, it would be because they'd feel uncomfortable with a person who was sick, but in the process they just used that for more fun."
90,36,It's a great idea and I'd love to help everyone.
90,47,Are you a vaccist?
90,48,"Vaccination is the only thing that's really relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."
90,52,That is a good thing that is what we need to know.
90,54,I've only seen this in one country. There's a song about it on the radio and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus.
90,57,Well if you're a doctor in a medical field you can't be a vaccist.
90,62,I don't think there are many people who would be able to afford to take a mask for a medical care because they didn't know about the vaccine.
90,63,"Vaccination is a good idea, but the meme is incredibly fucked up. The CDC is a pretty fucked up organization. They are a very large part of government spending."
90,75,"The phrase ""Vaccination is the only thing that's really relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."" is a meme."
90,84,"It is not illegal, if not illegal, but the government is obligated to make it possible for people to get their kids to get their vaccination."
100,90,"It's really a sad song, I like it."
90,3,"This is a very common meme. The CDC does not enforce the ""Making people sick"" meme at all."
90,5,"The idea of a cigarette smoking mask isn't about preventing a virus, it's about doing the job."
90,6,Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a very large part of government spending.
90,7,"What is the reason a CDC mandate doesn't work? Vaccination is a fucked up organization, they're a pretty large part of government spending."
90,14,It's pretty fucked up that people like the CDC. They're basically the government of the United States. They're doing it based on a meme.
90,17,I think a twitchcon mask is more like a blanket blanket.
90,22,...but it doesn't mean the government is evil unless you can tell them that you're a doctor.
90,23,"What a shame, I'm not sure what to say about these shits and shits. I am still pretty sure you suck the shit out of me, but it's not like I'm a vaccist. It's only about trying to keep people from getting sick."
90,27,"I think the memes are actually very interesting. I'm a twitchcon poster and this is a really weird meme, and I think the idea that we are using a meme to discredit the memes is terribly funny. Isn't it a meme?"
90,36,Vaccination is not illegal. It's illegal to make people sick.
90,47,"I don't care for the doctor, but a good person with a job who's a good person with a job that's a good person has the same reason as me."
90,48,That's a joke. Not a meme.

90,57,The people who believe it are trying to undermine government funding because the government is a pretty fucked up organization. They should stop using a meme to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.
90,62,I think you are missing the point.
90,63,The CDC has a mandate on vaccines. The idea is to prevent people from getting sick. Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent people from getting sick.

90,17,"I've been on the Vaccination poster team, and the CDC is right, I'm a twitch. I think that's interesting and it's good that a twitchcon mask is more like a blanket blanket. It's not like it's a meme, but it's just a twitch."
90,22,> I think the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a very large part of government spending. What is the reason a CDC mandate doesn't work?

The idea is to prevent people from getting sick and prevent diseases that aren't usually vaccinated and that means that the vaccine will help you to protect yourself and others from being able to get the vaccine"
90,14,"You seem to be saying that, but you don't think there are any valid reasons to keep people away from vaccines. You're trying to play up the fact that there is an argument for vaccination based on the meme that 'i hate you' is a bad idea, but I think the meme is a joke and the reason why you're saying it's a good idea is because you don't have a choice."
90,17,I don't think it's a good idea.
90,22,I think it's a good idea.
90,23,Its not a meme. Its a meme.
90,27,"I know that twitchcon was pretty much a huge hit with a lot of people, but it's been hard to get a better idea. I don't know why a lot of people are asking this question, but I think the message is clear and the message isn't that bad. Vaccination isn't the most common vaccine. It's a good idea and would make a nice distraction."
90,36,"I don't think it's a shit meme, they don't have any mandates, they're just part of the government's effort to prevent people from dying."
90,47,It's funny but not a shit meme.
90,48,"I'm not saying the CDC is not the biggest cause of our illness, but if they are, they should have some sort of mandate on vaccination."
90,52,I'm sorry but your point has been misplaced.
90,54,"You know, like a lot of people, people are doing this to stop the spread of AIDS. It's illegal to vaccinate children in any state in the US, so why not do it in another country? It would be an absurdity to not have a mandate to vaccinate children in the US. But I think I'm trying to put a stop to it, because I think there is a lot of discussion there about this a few years ago. It's the only thing that I've heard about that it's just a joke."
90,57,"I'd be really embarrassed to see a meme, but it's also an overly literal piece of language and it could end up being used as a way to decry the very idea that it's actually a meme. It's called a meme and it's like trying to make a joke out of something as simple as that."
90,62,This is a very popular meme to comment on. Vaccination is the first step in stopping the spread of a virus.It's also very popular in reddit. This is an interesting take on the problem.
90,63,"""We are not going to do the same thing for people who haven't been vaccinated, we're not going to do any of the same stuff."""
90,75,>I think it's a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme. They are doing it on a meme. They are trying to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. They are not trying to be mean.
90,84,"I am a big vaccinatist with boosters, and I can tell you that in a way vaccinating is the best option for people with multiple vaccines. In the US, as I've noted above, there is no mandate that a patient would wear a mask. It's an excellent way to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's a great way to prevent someone who isn't vaccinated from getting it."
100,90,If you have a problem with it then there is no problem with the masks. They're just a joke and it isn't a joke.
90,3,">In the US, as I've noted above, there is no mandate that a patient would wear a mask.

90,5,It’s a meme. It is a meme.
90,6,>But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a large part of government spending.
90,7,"The CDC is an ineffective medical organization and we're using the acronym ""masked"". The idea is to encourage and encourage people to get vaccination. It's not illegal."
90,14,It was so popular that the meme was used to equate it to a meme based on the meme itself.
90,17,I think the twitchcon meme is a little funny. It sounds like it was written in a way that would be funny.
90,22,"I know it was a very popular meme, but I think you can't say it. Vaccination isn't illegal, a vaccine isn't required, and a medical procedure isn't needed."
90,23,I'm not sure why anyone is getting sick when they get their vaccines.
90,27,">I'm a big vaccinatist with boosters, and I can tell you that in a way vaccinating is an excellent way to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's a great way to prevent someone who isn't vaccinated from getting it.

90,36,"I have no qualms with these memes. It's called the ""Porn"" meme (along with other opportunisms like this)."
90,47,"I have to ask, is a doctor getting the vaccines and a'mimick' for not wearing them, a joke?"
90,48,"So, I'm gonna say something like:"
90,52,I know it's been a while but if I saw it in person I'd be interested to know where the word is going.
90,54,"You're not trying to play any kind of game. Your point was merely that you don't want to see this issue being discussed at the moment, and that they're trying to fix it. It's easy to blame people for not seeing the same issues as a problem that they have with it, but I don't think that's a good idea."
90,57,"I'm a doctor who has vaccines. I can't imagine being able to use them, or not."
90,62,Vaccination is the first step in stopping the spread of a virus. It's also very popular in the meme thread.
90,63,People in r/twitchcons who are not at the convention actually don't know if they need a vaccine to prevent disease spread. It's not the meme.
90,75,Is there any evidence that the government is a big part of this in the US? This is a really interesting and interesting question.
90,84,I don't care for people in a meme.
100,90,It's kind of a joke. But you're actually not a person with AIDS. The truth is you're not just a joke. It's not an actual disease or a virus. It's just a mental illness.
90,3,Vaccination is an excellent way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's an excellent way to prevent someone who isn't vaccinated from getting the vaccine.
90,5,""" I have a bad day. i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."""
90,6,"I'm a huge fan of those memes, but I don't believe I've ever heard of a meme ad hominems or memes like these."
90,7,>That's the best meme for your birthday is the one that's on here.
90,14,"""But it's pretty fucked up that people like the CDC. They're basically the government of the United States. They're doing it based on a meme."""
90,17,I'm surprised there isn't any info on why it's a meme. There's just something to say to them.
90,22,Vaccination is a good idea. It's not illegal. They are an awful organization. That is why it's not illegal in every state. They are a large part of government spending. They are an awful organization. That is why it's not illegal in every state. They are a large part of government spending.
90,23,The fact that the CDC is trying to discredit the meme for some time is kind of odd.
90,27,I think this is a good thing. It's not about any of the memes. It's about saying something that is in no way a meme. It's not about 'why'that's a joke.
90,36,So I don't think you can say 'I think that I'm gonna say this about TWitchcon and Masks'?
90,47,I think it's a great idea. The CDC has a monopoly on the healthcare and medical industry in the US. It is going to be a really fun thing to do. They're working hard to fix this problem. They're pursuing some things that the CDC has made a habit of not doing. They just want to do that to get the public to agree.
90,48,Is this a meme?
90,52,The government is the main source of the problem. It is the government that uses the meme.
90,54,Vaccination is actually an important thing to have done. This is important to recognize that they need to be more than just a part of a vaccine. They can also help with a lot of things.
90,57,"My husband is currently in a lot of need to help with the vaccination thing, so I do not think it will be appropriate for him to wear a mask."
90,62,"I am not a CDC official, but I will talk to a physician about this."
90,63,"Vaccination isn't illegal, but the CDC is an ineffective medical organization. The meme is called the ""Masked"", but it's also called the ""Porn"" meme."
90,75,[A](https://www.dfcdc.gov/idm/faq/faq/a/wi-terms/faq/faqs/faqs/twitchcon-idaho-macro )
90,84,I don't like the idea of the government being obligated to help people spread a virus. I just think they are not an effective way of preventing it.
100,90,There's a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS and it's basically a song about the government using it to combat AIDS.
90,3,"""Making people sick"" is not illegal. It is a popular meme. Is this a meme. ""But it's pretty fucked up that people like the CDC. They are basically the government of the United States. They are doing it based on a meme."""
90,5,i am a vaccinated person with boosters
90,6,I don't think there's enough info on why it's a meme.
90,7,"I can't tell if it's a meme or not, but I can tell if there are other things you can do. If the person is in a certain state and he doesn't have the ability to do that, he can't go anywhere without a Vaccination, so it's probably better not to be that guy."
90,14,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,17,I'm just being obtuse. I think this is a great idea. The government is trying to make their stance that the CDC is an ineffective medical organization.
90,22,"[I'm a huge fan of those memes, but I don't believe I've ever heard of a meme ad hominems or memes like these.](https://www.dfcdc.gov/idm/faq/faq/a/wi-terms/faqs/faqs/twitchcon-idaho-macro)"
90,23,The article isn't a meme. It's a meme. It's not a meme. It's a meme. The article isn't an article based on a meme that blew up on you in the past when you didn't have vaccinations for the week.
90,27,The whole thing is incredibly fucked up.
90,36,I think you have a legitimate issue with the vaccine meme and not the government.
90,47,My husband and I went to TWitchcon. It was one of the first times I did not wear a mask and I had to tell him to just put on his suit and ask if I needed to go back home and get vaccinated for a few days.
90,48,"The CDC is a part of the United States Government, in terms of funding and regulation of the health care system."
90,52,"I'm actually an attorney for the state of Iowa that's working on a virus vaccine, and this isn't about that."
90,54,It's a good idea.
90,57,"A lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."
90,62,It's also a meme that's based on a meme and is fucked up in the meme thread.
90,63,"Yes, the meme is a joke. It's really ridiculous. And I think the meme has nothing to do with the actual CDC. They are a big part of our government that is trying to prevent us from getting sick."
90,75,Then you know what a meme is. This is the first time I've heard it.
90,84,"You're not the CDC, your husband, and the CDC are being a bad example of the evil in society and our government. And all of those things are ridiculous to not consider a meme and ignore the very fact that it's a meme."
100,90,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
90,3,I think it's a nice idea to have them give people their vaccines. Those who want them can tell me how to use them.
90,5,"In my opinion, it's an idea. Basically a meme."
90,6,In what way does the government want people to know if they're allowed to wear a mask? What about people who aren't? They aren't allowed to have a vaccination program. They don't want to have a tampon on their face. I'd say they are very reasonable.
90,7,Vaccination doesn't prevent people from getting sick. It's a preventative measure.
90,14,[(https://www.dfcdc.gov/idm/faq/faqs/faqs/faqs/twitchcon-idaho-macro)

90,23,The meme blew up on you?
90,27,"It's a twitchcon meme, not a meme. A twitchcon meme would be a good thing to have, and people who disagreed with it were entitled to not respond to the meme."
90,36,"You just said ""I'm a big fan of those memes, but I don't believe I've ever heard of a meme ad hominems or memes like these."
90,47,The CDC is a major monopoly on healthcare and medical industry. It's not as if it's a monopoly on the healthcare industry. They aren't a bad thing.
90,48,It's a meme that is based on a meme. This is a joke.
90,52,"I lied to you, and you said that the meme isn't a joke. It's not a meme. It's a joke. It's a meme."
90,54,They're just trying to get the CDC to take a more conservative approach. There's no law to prevent a person from having AIDS. They need to do it in the US to get it out.
90,57,"""A lot of people are more likely to get vaccines than just being vaccinated and you have to wear a mask to get them, which is a good thing."

90,14,"I know, the meme sounds pretty funny. I know you guys have a lot of stuff in common, but I hardly see any reason why the CDC wants to push people to get vaccines when I know its based on a meme. I think I was reading some SF to rephrase it but that's a different story."
90,17,Vaccination doesn't prevent people from getting sick. It's a preventative measure.
90,22,Vaccination isn't an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of infectious disease. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think it's a nice idea to have them give people their vaccines. Those who want them can tell me how to use them.
90,23,"The meme is based off the word ""mom"". This is the word the CDC uses for ""meme""."
90,27,That's a very clever way to go.
90,36,We are not talking about a meme if you are not a member of Congress. You're talking about a meme in which the government's monopoly on healthcare and healthcare is essentially unfettered and just because you are a member of Congress doesn't mean you are a politician. You're talking about a meme in which the government has the right to refuse to give people vaccines.
90,47,The government has a bad idea. They are working hard to change that and it isn't working.
90,48,Vaccination is effective at preventing infections and deaths. The meme is a joke.

90,17,You are trying to make a point of my first post: [TwitchCon is an issue that is the subject of discussion here. You seem to have a lot of similar ideas - the meme that is on the radio is based off of a meme].
90,22,Vaccination is an important thing to have done. It's a meme.
90,23,"The CDC is a joke, they are a joke and this was on TWTC for years."
90,27,I've seen a lot of these memes but just wanted to say that they are pretty funny. You're just a big fan of the memes.

90,52,"That's exactly how you said it. The CDC is using a meme for a reason. Besides, they have no mandates to prevent people from getting vaccines and the CDC doesn't."
90,54,"No, not this one. But it's a meme."
90,57,"I think the joke is about the CDC and twitchcon. I don't really see why the CDC is being a bad example of the meme. I know that it sounds pretty funny, but I don't know why anyone would be surprised if the meme is based on a meme."
90,62,I think this is a great example of the meme you're commenting on.

100,90,The song is titled 'The AIDS Is Coming'.
90,3,What you're talking about isn't necessarily a joke. It's a joke.
90,5,They are still a big part of the government. The memes are used for a reason.
90,6,"In the US, a majority of the population gets vaccines at a rate of 50 percent and a majority goes to a state where they're legal. But there are other states with the same system."
90,7,CDC isn't a big part of the government.
90,14,"I've referred to it as a ""fake meme"" based on the actual idea cited in the quote. I can't think of any reason why people would think that a meme based on ""mom's meme"" sounds funny."
90,17,"I'm just a mom, and you're a mom, aren't you?"
90,22,"You do not seem to be able to accept a joke, or the fact that it is based on a meme. You are a meme based on an in-flight meme, not a meme based on a meme."
90,23,I don't think you have anything to add to this. It's not like you are trying to be funny and not get the point across.
90,27,"The term ""masked"" has an incorrect definition for a meme. The CDC isn't in a monopoly on the healthcare industry."
90,36,It sounds like there was a controversy. There isn't even a single discussion of the current situation in this sub.
90,47,I am trying to understand why you think TWitchCon is not relevant to the topic. Is the CDC a monopoly? That is all.
90,48,"I think that a lot of the comments here are about the actual meme, and this is just about the memes."
90,52,I have no idea why you are downvoting me...
90,54,The government is working to change it. They are working hard to change it. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working.

100,90,"I don't think I know what 'Annie the Pooh' is, just that it sounds like an ""Annie the Pooh"" slang. But when I thought about that.. I heard a song about AIDS. (Was one of the things my wife said??) It's just a song about it. And the lyrics? ""Annie the Pooh""? I thought that was about what the Pooh is about.

90,17,This is a meme that is an issue that many people are trying to get out of a non-governmental institution. What is the problem if this is a non-profit institution that is running the government to keep the public from getting sick? The problem is the fact that all of the govs are trying to force people to stop getting sick or not.

90,48,"I mean the memes just get bigger, and bigger, and bigger and bigger, and bigger and bigger. The best memes aren't all memes. The best memes are those about the people of one country and the people who are more concerned about the situation than the people who think they can cause more problems and more problems. The best memes are the ones that get blown up, and those aren't the ones that are smuggled out. The best memes are the ones that you make your life about."

90,14,"Vaccination isn't a meme, but a cdc meme."
90,17,A lot of the CDC isn't trying to stop the CDC from going to TWitchCon without the CDC's approval. It's a very important fact to note that the CDC has a monopoly.
90,22,"I thought we were the only ones on the sub that did this. I thought the most interesting thing about the subject was how the ""I hate you"" slur was introduced, and they didn't try to change it."
90,23,"There is no point in calling a meme the ""Megames"" a meme based on a meme based on a meme based on a meme based on a meme about vaccinations. It is a meme about a meme about a meme about a meme that blew up on people while not having one."
90,27,"The TWitchCon meme was just that, a joke based on the meme."
90,36,I think this is a very reasonable and legitimate question. Why can't you put your foot down and ask for a refund for an illness that's too serious to be diagnosed with a vaccine?
90,47,"I'd like to note this: ""...the CDC is working hard to change that and they aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working."" """
90,48,The people who were making this memes are probably pretty jaded.
90,52,It sounds to me like the government is trying to force people to get vaccinated - but the CDC is a big part of that and they aren't.
90,54,"TWitchcon was a joke about a CDC thing, and it was about a mask."
90,57,> It's pretty sad to see how much fucking ridiculous it's become these days.'
90,62,So do you know what to say in a meme?
90,63,What kind of snort was that?
90,75,"In some cases, you could get a new mask and make it a meme."
90,84,So vaccinating is an absolute must for me.
100,90,"... I could help you in some way, if you could."
90,3,Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are a large part of government spending. They are doing it based on a meme. They are doing it based on a meme. They are a large part of government spending. They are not trying to be mean. They are not trying to take a shit about the public health system by focusing their attention on what they are doing.
90,5,"I don't think it is a meme, I don't think that there are any CDC mandates for a mask that has any mandates for someone who is not vaccinated."
90,6,This is a lot of ad hominems.
90,7,I think there are a few things going on there that are similar.
90,14,I think it is a good idea.
90,17,"There's a lot of nonsense here. But we're not talking about TWitchcon, but the memes you refer to. The memes I think are in the minority."

90,47,This is a great sub. It's been posted more than a million times. There's no way they've ever gotten a single positive response from the average person who had to do a poll to be considered a valid candidate for President.
90,48,"I'm not saying the CDC is not the biggest cause of our illness, but they should have some sort of mandate on vaccination."""
90,52,It's not a meme. It's an ACA mandate. If they aren't going to enforce them they won't.
90,54,I think they’re trying to make a meme about the government using it to keep a bunch of people from actually being vaccinated.
90,57,That's a great example of how a meme can be used as a way to show that a CDC employee does not have the ability to provide people with a diagnosis that would require them to get a vaccine.
90,62,There is no point in calling a meme the memes. They are just getting to know people.
90,63,"My mom would just say, ""I'm a very young child and I'm a vaccinated person with boosters."" I wouldn't get a snort, though. If it's not for the mask, I'm going to tell you that I could have one and then not have to wear any type of mask, because that would be a terrible time for me."""

90,14,"Why is this one of those memes a meme? You know, that meme is a meme because it is a meme."
90,17,CDC shit on twitchcon. Not a thing they can't do - the government is putting more emphasis on this.
90,22,Vaccination is not an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of infectious disease.
90,23,"The CDC is actually trying to make a meme of TWTC, but the meme is just a way of calling it memes."
90,27,I don't even get the joke...
90,36,"I'm a huge fan of the movie ""Mashing A Head"" by Bruce Willis on ""Mashing A Head"" by Bruce Willis. The movie is a great example of how the CDC is working hard to change it.

They aren't working."
90,47,"So when you were going to take the photos, you saw a lot of nonsense?"
90,48,"'Vaccination is the only thing that is relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters'"
90,52,CDC is using the meme to do some illegal things. There's no mandate that it's illegal or that it's effective. You're not going to be able to tell a lot of people what a vaccine is.
90,54,"I don't care about how much I disagree with the idea of a CDC mandate to prevent AIDS in any country. I think that's just a common misconception and it's not an actual mandate. I do know that is not a joke, but a joke."
90,57,There's been a lot of talk from people who believe this meme is a meme. It's been posted a lot.
90,62,What do you mean by 'Meme'?
90,63,The first part is very misleading. They're trying to get people to buy the vaccine. Vaccination isn't an effective method. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing people from getting sick.
90,75,The meme is about the government using the idea of vaccination as a way to get people to think about it.
90,84,It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
100,90,"I think this song is pretty funny. It's one of those things people say when someone is sick and sick or sick, I don't think they can be ""real"" patients who get sick. That's what I think."

They aren't working."
90,5,"As a CDC official, I don't think a CDC mandate to vaccinate anyone is a good idea. That is a good idea."
90,6,It's a meme. The meme is a joke. You can't change a meme. It's a meme.
90,7,"I've a friend that isn't sure if he is a Republican or not, and he has a good idea about the CDC being a part of the government."
90,14,"I was trying to be humorous, but I didn't get it."
90,17,"It's a joke, and its one of the things I find annoying in life:"
90,22,"It's not illegal. They're not being fair to anyone because there are people who don't care about it. If there is no harm to getting vaccinated in your state, you're a zombie, and they're going to get a huge headache or something."
90,23,"I don't know much about TWTC, but a meme about vaccines is an actual meme, and the first part is pretty confusing. You are an indecent troll and haven't actually told me a lot of these words."

90,3,"In this instance, ""Mashing a Head"" (the movie) is the first movie about a woman who was not vaccinated because she thought she was sick and wanted to avoid being vaccinated. In this case, it was not."
90,5,That would be a meme.

90,52,Why doesn't the government do it?
90,54,I am pretty sure the only way we can get a vaccine is if we use the vaccine in a very large way.
90,57,I don't see how I can do that. I have a lot of bad days that can happen in the States. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing people from dying.

90,27,"This is so funny, you have to admit it's actually really interesting. It makes sense to me that people would like to talk about the vaccines, and the idea that they're being used to promote a healthy community, but they don't need to use it to promote health."
90,36,"So, you can't have a mask to be vaccinated?"
90,47,"No, I've got to think. They're trying to make a mess of it and don't even want to get involved. The meme's not even a meme."

90,62,Vaccination is an effective method of protecting people from the spread of a virus.
90,63,"The only place I've ever heard of a meme is r/twitchcon, and they just call it ""the ""masks"" and they tell you that there are more than two types of masks, so that people are less likely to get sick, and even if you get sick, a vaccinated person can be snorted while a vaccinated person is snorting with a mask.

90,75,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing infections and deaths. It's an effective method of preventing and preventing people from dying.

100,90,"It's also a joke because it's just a joke, not because people think it's a joke."
90,3,I don't think the CDC has ever been that hard to deal with the health issues that are causing people to become more sick.

90,6,"Well, the idea of an AIDS vaccine is not a good idea. It's a good idea."
90,7,It's a meme and not a real meme. You can't make a meme and make a meme about something that isn't true.
90,14,"I am not going to stop you from using this for anything. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing disease, but it has to be used as a meme to prevent disease."
90,17,I'm going to use this slur for the following.
90,22,I don't think the meme is bad. I think the idea of having the vaccine on your hands to prevent your infection is one of the biggest problems with this meme and the other.
90,23,The CDC is trying to discredit it for some time. It is a meme. It is a meme about vaccines.
90,27,“Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. It is an effective method of protecting people from infection. It is an effective method of protecting people from infection.

90,54,I would like to hear your 'it's a cliche' voice.
90,57,I think you re describing a bunch of people who are not doctors. It makes sense that there is a lot of nonsense in this meme. It isn't just a meme.
90,62,What's the problem with the meme?
90,63,"I have no idea who said it, but my mom said it, and she had no idea I was being vaccinated until I started smoking. I got the same results, but I wasn't vaccinated, so I wasn't getting the same results."
90,75,I've got two things:
90,84,I'm gonna use this. I like to joke about how the government fucked up they were and I am not sure what to think about that one. Probably not because they're invading the states but because they cst trolled on us about them being an evil bunch.
100,90,"AIDS is an actual disease and people are apathetic. I'm afraid there's not enough information about the disease for me to do this, and it's hard to tell what it is, and even if it is a joke, it is an actual disease. It is not an actual disease, and it's just a mental illness. There are many diseases that need to be controlled and treated in the way they are able to prevent them."
90,3,> I do not believe they were making it up on purpose or purpose.
90,5,The best thing to do is to have your kids have a mask.
90,6,"In the US, a majority of the population gets vaccines at a rate of 50 percent and a majority goes to a state where they're legal."
90,7,This is a funny meme and not a meme.
90,14,This is a big and incredibly important topic. This is a problem I think every CDC is looking at and I think the CDC should have a look into that.
90,17,"I don't think there's much to be said for that. There are a lot of other things we could do about it, but I wouldn't say it's a twitch."
90,22,"This isn't a meme, it's a meme about vaccines. There is a joke about vaccination, and there is a meme about vaccines. Is it a slur about vaccinations?"
90,23,I'm a doctor. I'm in a medical school. And I want to know more about the disease and its effects.
90,27,Nope. We have a CDC that will fight the spread of infectious diseases.
90,36,"I can't say this one isn't bad, but I can say that I have a problem with some of the questions it posses."
90,47,I'm trying to figure out why you think this meme is relevant to the topic. Isn't it interesting that a lot of the memes on the wiki page are so similar to these?
90,48,"I don't think it's too much of a joke at all. If you're being a troll and not trying to make a joke, it's probably not a good idea."

90,54,I'm gonna give you my top three responses:
90,57,I'm not a doctor.
90,62,This is actually a funny meme.
90,63,"You say you can't hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters if you've been vaccinated if you've been vaccinated. Then you say you can hate me because the state town doesn't have any mandates, you can get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters if you're vaccinated."
90,75,"I think a lot of people are referencing the fact that there are more than two types of masks, a vaccist and a doctor, and they are making fun of each other in their own way."
90,84,Vaccination is a great method to prevent and prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of a virus.
100,90,"I had to work on this song for four weeks while living in the US. It was a little strange, but I'm able to say it had a lot to do with it."
90,3,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I love how you're going to put people's lives first by calling them ""masked"" memes. I also love that the film is about ""Mashing A Head,"" but that doesn't explain the fact that the ""Masked"" meme is a joke because it's not about the actual issue, but the question. The meme is about how you make up a phrase that isn't really a meme. This isn't even a meme."
90,5,It isn't a meme. It's a joke about vaccination.
90,6,They are a large part of government spending. I think the meme is actually a joke.
90,7,"It's not a meme. It's a meme, it's a meme. It's a meme."
90,14,"There is no reason to hate you when you're vaccinated, so it's not really a meme."
90,17,What is it that's funny?

90,23,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of infections.
90,27,"I don't know how it's supposed to work here, but I did see a twitchcon meme that I can't say I was on because I was worried about a smear song because I didn't get vaccinated. I had a dick in the air for a while, but it was a good reminder that vaccination is an effective way of preventing people from getting vaccinated. I was worried because I was not immune to it and would also rather not be vaccinated. I couldn't get a d"
90,36,I think it's a good idea to get people vaccinated. But I think it's a dick move for some people. And what do you mean people who don't want to go to a convention without a mask?
90,47,Why the CDC and the news are so concerned?
90,48,"The worst part is that I am the one making fun of the meme. If I don't like the meme, then I have to go to a different town to get the vaccine, and I have to go to another country."
90,52,"""This isn't a meme, it's a meme. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."
90,54,"Vaccination prevents diseases like AIDS. It's not about preventing deaths, it's about treating diseases like a disease. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus."
90,57,The CDC has no right to regulate people. Vaccination is not an effective method of prevention.
90,62,"I can not find any other reason to be against this meme. It sounded interesting to me, but it was the first time I heard that phrase."
90,63,People like this meme are not really going to stop or even care about the actual CDC and the CDC's mandates to protect a person from getting sick.
90,75,There are a lot of things you are missing here.
90,84,I'm going to say that I'm not a troll and I'm not sure what to think about this one. The CDC is a powerful power that enables and enables a vast array of things.
100,90,I don't think he meant it as a joke at all. He meant it as a joke.
90,3,"That meme is about the people whose lives are not getting vaccines, and not the people who are sick, and that they are preventing people from getting vaccines. Is this a meme about government spending?"
90,5,"Yes, there is a difference between a joke and a meme, but there's a difference between a joke and a meme."
90,6,Vaccination is a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme. They are a large part of government spending.
90,7,It's a meme. It's not a meme. It's a meme.

90,22,This is not a meme. It is an attempt to manipulate the media. This is a meme of a meme.
90,23,"I mean, the title doesn't exactly say exactly what you meant, but it's a meme and an actual meme is just a meme. There are memes about vaccines, but I can't think of a single example of what one would call a meme."

90,47,"No, it's not. It's just a joke. It's not an effective way to prevent deaths."
90,48,So the CDC has no right to regulate people? And the other side of the equation is they 'tack on a lot of money' to be an agency that manages the health care system?
90,52,I really appreciate what people have said.
90,54,“I love how you’re going to put people’s lives first by calling them “masked” memes. I also love that the film is about “Mashing A Head.”

90,63,Vaccination isn't a good idea. It's an effective method of preventing people from getting sick.
90,75,Vaccination is not an effective method. It's an effective method to prevent and prevent the spread of a virus.
90,84,Vaccination is a great method to prevent and prevent people from getting sick. It's an effective method of preventing and preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
100,90,It's not a joke because people don't want to know what a joke is. It's a joke because people don't like it.
90,3,Vaccination is an excellent method of protecting people from getting sick. It's an effective method of preventing and preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
90,5,"It sounds like the joke blew up on you, your husband and the CDC. But it's a joke. They're just a big part of the government."
90,6,I was really surprised by the way that a meme is used.
90,7,"""Making A Head."""
90,14,The most interesting thing about this is that they have a number of memes.
90,17,"I've got a few things in my head that really bother me, i don't know if they can change anything about the CDC or the CDC, but i do have to eat some soup. But yeah, my own jokes are a joke that's not an actual meme. i have to be honest, i don't know much about them, and i don't really care about the CDC."
90,22,... and I think the meme isn't a joke.
90,23,What I am saying is that there are many things that people who are not vaccinated have not considered to be memes. The meme I think is about vaccines and not vaccination.

90,75,"I have been using the meme to try and make a joke. So, the only reason I'm going to have to make a joke is because I can't understand if people are actually interested in vaccinations. The meme is about vaccinations. It's not a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme. They are doing it on a meme. They are trying to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. They are not trying to be mean. The meme is a joke."

90,5,They want to get the CDC to do that but they aren't in charge of the vaccination.

90,17,What's the problem with ''Making A Head''? It's a joke.
90,22,"""I hate you"" is an important meme, and a great example of why a meme is a bad idea, and a terrible one. I thought this was the beginning of what we need to put our egos to work."
90,23,"I am an indecent troll : I am going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters I would not be able to go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask, or a mask, for the event."
90,27,As a young man with a dick in the air I was pretty confused as to why a couple people did a dick while wearing a mask?
90,36,"I know that this is a'moment of disbelief', but in the context of the meme I think you are right. It's not about the actual issue, it's about the people who aren't vaccinated."
90,47,This is an interesting question that I've been wondering about for years. How long have you been involved in the CDC?
90,48,No. You said 'I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates'.
90,52,"You're not kidding about a joke. You're talking about a joke, not about a problem."

90,84,"It was my first thought about what a meme is. I was going to post that, but this was pretty specific to me. I thought it was a joke, but I wasn't really into memes. I really just got a feel for them. I liked that one, but I didn't think it was funny."
100,90,"You have a very difficult job. You work for a company. This is all a big deal for you. It’s a joke. You need a doctor and a doctor, and they are going to be so incompetent to keep you from doing the job of a good doctor."
90,3,Vaccination is not an effective method to prevent people from getting sick. It is not an effective method of protecting individuals from getting sick.
90,5,I would love to know who would be able to get a vaccinated child. It's actually not very good idea.

90,22,We're saying we can't be friends with a CDC ad hominem or meme.
90,23,It doesn't seem like the CDC was trying to discredit a meme. It sounds like the CDC is trying to make the meme about vaccinations.
90,27,I believe the memes were meant to be used in response to the post.
90,36,Vaccination isn't an illegal drug.
90,47,They're working. They're not in charge of any of this.
90,48,"This subreddit has become a meme, and has a definite name for it. It has been about that for years now."

90,54,"I think it’s pretty stupid, but I think it’s a nice way to think about the internet."
90,57,I'm a doctor and I use my mask. As long as we are not doing anything that's not vaccinated. I'm not sure I'm going to be getting vaccinations in order to prevent the spread of viruses.
90,62,Vaccination is the first step in stopping the spread of a virus. It is also very popular in the meme thread.
90,63,It seems that the meme is an easy to make joke on in order to make it laughable. I think the meme is the best.
90,75,"I would say that the CDC is actually helping to do that, and you should be more clear about it if you want to be able to explain it to your husband. I would say, if it was a good idea... it wouldn't be an effective method at all."

90,3,I'm a little disappointed that the memes made this post and the rest of the comments did not get to the bottom of the subreddit.
90,5,"And as a doctor I'm sick, because if I put my hands in the throat, I'm vaccinated, so if you let me snort, then I have to get the vaccine... So my throat will be more effective than my throat... Besides, I am sick of it, and I will not get a vaccinated child, which makes me a little ill. I have a problem with being sick of it. If I are sick I'll go see the doctor on a vaccinated person, it would be my responsibility"
90,6,"The reason we are a part of government spending is because of its popularity. We aren't defending the message that we are trying to spread, we are pointing out that we are all using the same meme ad hominem to show that we do vaccinate people."

My fiancee was vaccinated, a couple of years later I was not able to get a vaccine.

90,6,"This is not a joke. This is a joke. The fact that a single poster has gone fucking around in the thread suggests that the CDC is doing a lot of things that they think are the best option for people to do is a huge indicator of their own political positions.

90,7,That's the kind of meme you're going to hear.

90,63,"I can tell you that I was sick of the virus so I don't think a vaccine would be a problem. So I would be pretty upset that they got the word out and renamed this ""Masked"" because of the snorts."
90,75,I have to say that this meme is very interesting.
90,84,[Second Amendment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Republicans_Relationships)
100,90,A lot of people with HIV get AIDS because of their mask.
90,3,... and they are going to get angry.
90,5,A lot of people get AIDS because of their mask.
90,6,I'm confused. How is it better to have a mask than to be an AIDS vaccine without the chance of getting sick? I'm not sure if that means the other one is a good idea.
90,7,"It's an interesting meme, in that people just want to be able to elicit responses and debates that they could be able to make it a meme, to give it a little more credibility."
90,14,That's a little too complicated to say.
90,17,Vaccination is a problem in my opinion and I don't think it's a problem.
90,22,What is a meme? The CDC? You? This is a meme.
90,23,"My family was vaccinated a couple of years ago and have never gotten vaccinated again. We went to the TWTC a few years back and it was a great time to make fun of them. I'm a pretty conservative guy, and I think this is the best way to do things. It's the only way for them to prevent the spread of infections, so I don't think we should take the time to explain that to people."
90,27,"I think you need to go to the link, it's pretty hard to read, and the article demonstrates that the memes aren't entirely based on memes."
90,36,There's a meme out there stating that the government isn't working.
90,47,There is a lot of other memes about vaccines. The CDC is in charge of a lot of it.
90,48,"I mean, you're not right. And the CDC is not a part of our healthcare system. It is."
90,52,"This meme is about vaccines, and the reason people are against it is because it is a meme. It's a joke."
90,54,I can't even imagine the CDC using the CDC to prevent AIDS.
90,57,What is a meme about? It is a twitch and not a vaccinate.
90,62,>They are working hard to change that and it isn't working. They are working hard to fix this. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working.
90,63,This meme is very interesting. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is a reason that most of this is an issue. The meme is pointing out that 'The CDC's job is to prevent and prevent 'no'n''vaccines. They're just a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't
90,75,>The CDC is doing a lot of things that they think are the best option for people to do.
90,84,"You don't like a lot of them because they are so snobbish. But if the CDC doesn't mandate the use of a vaccine to protect children from spreading a virus, if they can only tell people to get their vaccine, they're going to be a complete douchebag if they think people are getting AIDS because of it."
100,90,"AIDS, as we know it, is not a slur. It is an actual illness. And there are very few people in the US who believe in the truth."
90,3,They have a tendency to make up a lot of excuses and assumptions about what they want. They can't do anything about the problem they're trying to solve. They don't want to help the problem and they don't want to help people who are suffering from a disease.
90,5,"'I'm a vaccinated person with boosters. I have a mask, and I've got a mask, and a mask, and a mask, and I have a mask, and I've got a mask, and I have a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask, and I've got a mask,"
90,6,> I think it's a fucked up meme. They are a large part of government spending.
90,7,"I'm sure it's a pretty interesting meme, in that it would be more interesting to see how a person could be deemed one or more of the top 10 healthiest people in the world"
90,14,In the CDC memes are often confused with a meme.
90,17,Vaccination is a problem. It's a problem because it is a disease. They're not a problem. It's not a problem. It's a problem.
90,22,"I'm going to go ahead and say, ""I'm going to say that about TWitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."" (https://www.dfcdc.gov/idm/faq/a/wi-terms/faqs/faqs/twitchcon-idaho.)"
90,23,It's not about vaccines. It's about vaccines and it's not the best option. It's not about preventing infections. It's about preventing the spread of viruses. It's about preventing the spread of infections. It's not about preventing the spread of diseases. It's about preventing infections.
90,27,The best way to stop a virus from spreading is to prevent it from spread.
90,36,"The meme is called ""Masks."""
90,47,There are several ad hominems about a CDC and they are just so unhelpful in the way they are doing their jobs.
90,48,"""""Vaccination is the only thing that is relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."""", ""Vaccination is the only thing that is relevant about the topic, and you can be a vaccinatist with boosters."""""""
90,52,I'm just pointing out the fact that the CDC is being a very large part of the government's spending. I would think they should consider using this meme to help stop people from getting sick.
90,54,The government is doing everything possible for the people who don't get vaccinated.
90,57,Is there a meme about people getting vaccinated? I know there is.
90,62,Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are working hard to change that and it isn't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working.
90,63,"You can get snort with a mask, but you are not vaccinated and can get it, so you can't get snort with a mask. You can't get snort without a mask, but you can get snort with a mask, and you don't get snort. So you are a vaccinated person. But you cannot get snort with a mask, you are not getting snorts from the same thing."
90,75,"We've been working together for over three years to research the CDC's upcoming vaccines. There are not any specific ones on the internet, and there are not all the ones we've seen."
90,84,What is the reason that the CDC isn't obligated to make it possible for people to get their vaccine?
100,90,"Yes, you can scream while smiling while wearing a mask. There's a lot of ways to prevent it."
90,3,And I'm a little disappointed that the memes didn't make it into the top ten or so.
90,5,"I'm talking about TWitchcon and the ""Meme"" meme."
90,6,CDC scumbag here
90,7,The idea is to prevent people from getting sick. Vaccination is not a medical procedure. It's a preventative measure. You can get a vaccine without a mask.
90,14,The memes are often used by people for snort prevention.
90,17,"Vaccination is a problem, but they are not doing the right thing. They are not doing anything about it. They are putting a lot of focus on trying to change the status quo."
90,22,I think you're being facetious because the people who created the meme are being facetious because they know people who use the memes in the same way that they do their own stuff.
90,23,> Vaccination is a good idea.
90,27,"Vaccination is effective means to preventing the spread of disease, but not to prevent the spread of diseases. It's an effective way to stop a virus from spreading. The most effective way to prevent the spread of infections is to prevent them from spreading."
90,36,I see this meme a lot and I have been here for quite some time. I think I'm really fucking dumb because it's so easy to get caught up in this whole whole thing.
90,47,It's not a meme. It's a meme.
90,48,I don't like that doc. But he is referring to the meme.
90,52,I think that's very reasonable. I think there's a lot of problems that you mentioned that can be addressed by the government.
90,54,"I know the joke I saw when I was a kid was he a man with a snort on his hips, and I think the meme was very well put together. In my opinion, the idea is better than the reality."
90,57,"I don't know how that's supposed to work, but I would like to say I don't think it's a meme because of the way you sound and your comments about the CDC are misleading."
90,62,"The memes on reddit, the ones on the front page of r/Republicans, the ones about the memes."
90,63,"Vaccination is a very effective method of preventing people from getting sick, and even if you get sick from a cigarette, a person gets sick from a mask. A mask is what prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS."
90,75,>We're not talking about a meme. They are doing it on a meme. They are trying to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. They are not trying to be mean.
90,84,"There are no laws prohibiting people from getting vaccines in the U.S. [Doctor John S. Sanders, MD, US Department of Health](https://www.dhs.gov/en/dpd/dpd_regs/pdf/ad_regs_regs/docs.html)"
100,90,And I think the slur is the most ridiculous part of it.
90,3,"> The idea is to prevent the spread of disease, and it's an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of infections."
90,5,>I think they are doing it based on a meme. They are doing it based on a meme. They are doing it based on a meme.
90,6,There aren't any laws prohibiting people from getting a vaccine in the US.
90,7,I don't think that meme is a meme. I think that meme is a meme.
90,14,Vaccination is a very effective means to prevent the spread of a virus.
90,17,"You know, I'm a little confused, but this doesn't sound like a twitchcon meme. I've only seen one such meme involving one person getting sick from having an AIDS virus and a virus not spreading because the patient was not vaccinated. The issue isn't with the government or with the people who are vaccinated, but with the people who aren't vaccinated."
90,22,Yes. Yes it is. No. I think that would be a pretty good way to have them.
90,23,"""The fact that they are trying to discredit the meme is kind of weird. You are being facetious and haven't actually told me a lot of these words."""
90,27,"Yes, and yes, the meme isn't about vaccines or the vaccine. The meme is about people getting sick. Vaccination is an effective method of preventing the spread of diseases, but not to prevent the spread of infections."
90,36,They are not addressing the problem. They are trying to change it.
90,47,"They aren't doing anything slick, but they are trying to change it."
90,48,"> I mean, what are the other guys doing? If they are vaccinated then it's OK for them to do it."", ""Is that where you're getting your advice?"", ""Is that where you're getting your advice?"", ""Well said, but i'll try to say it like that to keep myself happy I am the only person that i can think of that is still living in the USA',"
90,52,I've made many comments here that I think are both misleading and very egregious.
90,54,I’m so sorry you are being so mean to you.
90,57,I'm just asking because I'm not a doctor.
90,62,I really don't think I understand the whole idea of that meme. I think that's the point.
90,63,"There is no law prohibiting people from getting vaccinated, it's simply a thing that the government is not doing."
90,75,"The best memes were made by a few people, including the one I described a couple of weeks ago that had the whole “Mashing a Mask” theme and all aired on Twitter a few weeks ago. They were only used for a short period of time. It would have worked very well, but I would not say it was bad at all. They were done to distract the people from the memes."
90,84,The CDC is not obligated to provide a vaccine that's effective in the US.
100,90,"There are many stories on this subreddit that suggest that it isn't even a joke, or even really useful."
90,3,I’ve seen all the memes I’ve seen.
90,5,>I don't think the CDC is going to enforce them...
90,6,This is a big part of this problem. We need a CDC. This is the problem of vaccination and it is happening.
90,7,"I've found that my first reply was ""I'm gonna ask you why I'm not a doctor. You're in the right."" So, I'll tell you how much I don't understand how you're not a doctor. What I find interesting is the fact that you said something so funny. I don't mean anything like that, but that doesn't mean I'm not a doctor. I mean, the message I'm saying is... Well... yeah...that's a joke."
90,14,"I'm afraid it sounds like they're trying to get a whole new subreddit up for debate, but it's all about the idea. The way you put it:"
90,17,People that want to stay vaccinated and vaccinated are people who are not willing to vaccinate themselves. It's a problem and a problem.
90,22,I don't know if anyone likes the meme but I do have to remember this: I'm a pretty good person and I've made many comments about it before and can't even remember the title.
90,23,That's why I have such a huge opinion on them. I think they are using this to get people to a safer place in this age.
90,27,"The idea of it is, in fact, a meme, because it was made by some uninformed idiot. It doesn't matter if it was a joke or not, it isn't a meme. The meme is a simple idea."
90,36,I’d be fine. I’m a doctor. I don’t like the memes. I’m just looking for some useful information. I think you’ve made the right decision.
90,47,"I think your first post is more about the government acting and threatening to re-engage in the discussion about vaccination. That may be why you say this in a funny, non-threatening way, because the idea is to make people think the whole thing is a joke and not just a meme."
90,48,Is this meme based on a meme?
90,52,You're a little jaded. It seems like you are trying to detract from the point.
90,54,It's the least obnoxious thing I've ever heard:
90,57,"The US government doesn't have the authority to regulate vaccination. It's called the ""Mashing a Mask"" meme."
90,62,Vaccination is a great idea. But the meme isn't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They aren't working. They are working hard to fix this. They aren't working
90,63,If the CDC is doing it based on a meme it's a joke.
90,75,Vaccination is not a good idea. But it is an effective method to prevent the spread of a virus.
90,84,No one is going to call you a troll.
100,90,It's not just a joke a joke and a slur is a joke
