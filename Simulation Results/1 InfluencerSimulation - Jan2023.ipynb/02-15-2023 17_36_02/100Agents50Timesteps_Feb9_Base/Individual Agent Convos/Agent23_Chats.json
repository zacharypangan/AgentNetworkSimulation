My fiancee was vaccinated, a couple of years later I was not able to get a vaccine. I didn't realize that a vaccine isn't an illegal thing, but it's a great way to keep my husband safe, and to keep his foot on the bus. I don't think it's",
    "The point being that it's not about vaccinations but about vaccines, that it's about vaccines. You could just as easily argue that the vaccine is the only vaccine. A single vaccine is a good way to prevent the spread of diseases. I don't see how it's even a meme. It's not like they don't have any mandates to prevent AIDS.",
    "My family was vaccinated a couple of years ago and have never gotten vaccinated again. We went to the TWTC a few years back and it was a great time to make fun of them. I'm a pretty conservative guy, and I think this is the best way to do things. It's the only way for them to prevent the spread of infections, so I don't think we should take the time to explain that to people.",
    "It's not about vaccines. It's about vaccines and it's not the best option. It's not about preventing infections. It's about preventing the spread of viruses. It's about preventing the spread of infections. It's not about preventing the spread of diseases. It's about preventing infections.",
