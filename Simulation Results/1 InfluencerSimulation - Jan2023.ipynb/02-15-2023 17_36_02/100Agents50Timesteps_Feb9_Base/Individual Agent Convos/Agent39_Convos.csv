78,39,You should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life

41,39,You've been on the right track.'
45,39,In a previous sub I was a teacher and one of my students was a doctor. We were told that people who do not use masks can be a symptom of a disease.
51,39,I don't know that I understand this but I don't understand how this was done.
52,39,I'd rather that I be able to wear a mask while I'm trying to protect myself.
62,39,And I have a couple of friends who don't have a mask.
70,39,I was one of the first ones to come across this at the time.
78,39,The trick is to know why the people are talking about it.
80,39,"I'm not sure how anyone could have any evidence that the virus was being spread, but if that's the case, I would assume the government would be more concerned about the issue."
91,39,"I don't like wearing my mask, but i love it."

97,39,This is the real question. Doesn't it actually seem like something is not going to happen.
39,21,I'm a mom and my family have all of the masks. They say they keep you safe unless it causes a virus or something.
41,39,I'd love to see that movie as well. It sounds really good and I wouldn't want to see that movie in the first place. I would resign and quit working as a coach.
45,39,"I would resign and not work with a guy who is not a team coach. It's pretty much a thing. As an american, I don't see how you would feel with a mask on."
51,39,"In the US, it is illegal for people to have a child and the government to retaliate against them."
52,39,"IANAL. But the first part is pretty hilarious, and there's no fucking way it doesn't stop the government from doing their job. They are just trying to imply that it's because of something they don't like. They're trying to scuff things with it."
62,39,">I can't stand a politician being able to refuse to wear a mask. You have to be vaccinated for every one of the two types of avian influenzae vaccines, which means they're required to wear them in order to survive. Vaccinations are a good tool for getting to the point where you're being injected, and you also need to be wearing a respirator to prevent getting sick."
70,39,I think you're missing out.
78,39,"It's not a scam, it's a scam."
80,39,"I'm going to be honest. In my opinion, if the government hasn't actually said anything, I can't see the issue and just have a hysterical talk about it."
91,39,"I have a big restaraunt that I wear daily. I never really had a lot of fun wearing it. I still wear my mask because I can't wear a mask when I get to the table. I always have to wear my mask when I'm not eating. I don't want to be seen in public, but I don't like to be around people. I have to wear a mask to be around people, and when I'm not in the crowd I don't want to be around them. I don't have a mask, but I do see"

78,39,I don't think you are being sarcastic. This is a joke.
80,39,That's a bit of a stretch.
91,39,I think the most important thing to do is put on your mask to help make sure you're safe from being raped. I'm sure people that want to be raped aren't trying to be so mean.
94,39,"CANNOTANSWER (Smauga) - I lost a mask every other day. I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day. I think you're not a good person if you don't believe in this.

39,21,I walked into this in a really strange place today - on the sidewalk. I did the same thing.
41,39,He is an idiot. Not a doctor. He has a bad habit of being smothered by a virus and then telling them to go home. This man is trying to make a career and hasn't done a good job of doing it.
45,39,"I don't think that it's that good a cough is a clogging up your throat. That's just a bad cough and I think it's very a sign of a deficiency, and in some countries it's the worst cough ever in my country."
51,39,I lost my mask because I had forgotten about it when I was an adult. I have been removing it and the CDC says that it's not a scam. I was just going to give them all the instructions on how to get it back. It's basically the same as what's happening.
52,39,It's a joke about the government using masks.
62,39,It's not even a joke.
70,39,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it's necessary. They could give you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag."

They say they keep you safe unless it causes a virus or something.. I like how the person who has to wear a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people. Well you're being sarcastic.

41,39,I'm sure there is a story here. It's not a joke.

62,39,I think the guy wearing the masks was the one who was infected. I guess they are not as good as the ones that they are in the United States.
70,39,"I am a man, and I have to wear a mask. I don't know what else I want to say."
78,39,Those are just a few of the most popular phrases:
80,39,This is the type of post that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
91,39,I don't know where the naive dissent from the naive is coming from. I just find it extremely silly that people would put on a mask to be able to see things without it.
94,39,"""The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask, and they aren't allowed to have it, even if you are a government employee.

39,21,I would not have sat here for months if I had to wear the mask. I'd rather take the risk of being hit by a bullet than worry about it all day.
41,39,"There's a lot of people that want to get sick and die on a tv show and wear masks. There are some, like, doctors that have been around a while but not as much as the people who are currently in the field. It doesn't make it a joke. But it's a good thing."

51,39,"Oh, I was so afraid of the US!"
52,39,"""Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
62,39,I think this is the most common crowbar comment in r/Republicans_Relationships.
70,39,"People don't seem to understand what this is about, they are thinking about what to do with their lives. The people I'm seeing aren't going to make a lot of sense out of their lives, they're just going to make it out of their lives and you have to live. They're going to become the next victim of the CDC's government-supported scams."
78,39,The trick is to know why the people are talking about it.
80,39,"I'm a teen, and I feel like I owe this whole country. It's kind of the same with many issues of American culture and national identity and a lot of people just don't get it."
91,39,"OP, you are not being sarcastic and are a bit naive. This is an extremely difficult thing to do."
94,39,"""What was the tarot card made out of? That was a bad joke."
97,39,"You just sat in the middle of an interview where a person was asked to wear a mask. That was the official response to the question ""I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandate"
39,21,"if people are not going to change that, it would make me want to see what they are going to think and get back into the habit of wearing it"
41,39,"I had to see a doctor a few years back because it really didn't matter. He got into a very deep depression and I felt really stupid for that, but I still knew I had a serious case. And he blew his brain off the couch."
45,39,"Vaccines are in the commonwealth. They're very good for the environment. People need to be protected, they don't. The CDC needs to put a mandate by the government to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to put a mandate by the government to prevent an illness, which is a big problem for government, especially in the Middle East."
51,39,"The most important part of this question is ""Do you feel the need to make a face mask?"""

70,39,"I don't know if you're reading this but I was at a convention that involved the use of ""I have to wear a mask, but it seems like it's an easy solution. I just don't think there's anything wrong with it."" ""Well, you're not doing anything right"" ""It's just an easy solution."" I'm sure you're going to have to explain how to get better care of yourself because you don't want to do anything wrong."

80,39,... and the scumbag who is doing this is a dick.
91,39,"I think a lot of the comments are more eloquent than the most recent ones - ""The hive mind is the one that has the sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest sexiest"
94,39,"The fact that they contacted a government employee who lost a tarot card after a time out or even after a disaster is a warning to the government. Despite the fact that it's on the CDC website, there's a chance that this isn't a real, proven fact."
97,39,">If the vaccine is still available, I believe you would be able to get one on your way to a concert, the ticket price is set at $50 ($49), and you could even have a ticket to any other CDC event.

39,21,"I have a problem with the CDC and their scams, and they are constantly trying to try to try and make people think it's not a good idea to have a mask on, but only to get sick to see it and feel ashamed of their ability to stop it from spreading. They are also trying to make their people feel better and that they need to put a real, real,, real and real mandate on a mask to make them feel safe."
41,39,"> ""Why should people wear a mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think the point of dressing as a doctor is that it makes the people uncomfortable and makes you uncomfortable."
45,39,I believe the fact that a lot of people get AIDS is why the CDC is using the word'medical'to describe them. I am assuming people think of it as being a fad. They aren't.
51,39,"I don't think there is anything wrong with a fake, the CDC are just trying to make people look sick, not to mention they're putting up with the possibility of being infected."
52,39,This is why the games are canceled and I do not like to go and have sex.
62,39,It was posted a few times on social media and reeked of the people who don't even know what a mask is.
70,39,The mask is the best solution to stopping the spread of AIDS. There is no other way to stop it.
78,39,This is a big deal.
80,39,I'm still looking for a way to stop the spread of AIDS. We do not want to have to deal with the issue if our people aren't on a vaccine. We want to try and fight it. The US government has been making money off of AIDS. We will be evicted if they get AIDS. This is not a scam.
91,39,"I don't like wearing a mask, but I love it. I do wear it when I'm not eating. I have to wear it when I'm not in the crowd I don't want to be around them. I have to wear it when I'm not eating. I have to wear it when I'm not eating. I have to wear it when I can. I wear it when I'm not in the crowd I don't want to be around people. I have to wear it when I'm not in the crowd."

97,39,I'm not an attorney so I wouldn't have a valid case. But this is all my advice -
39,21,They have a mandate that allows people to be physically and mentally disabled to wear their mask.
41,39,You're going to need to make a TED Talk about this a lot. It's a great opportunity for your community to support your goals.
45,39,"The CDC is a scam. They are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
51,39,I was in a public hospital for several months and saw some signs of HIV and AIDS. It was a scary time for me.
52,39,"I love Obama and the idea of his pranks being funny and not making it a joke is a shame, but I think Trump's idea of the AIDS epidemic is probably pretty sexist, and a bit jarring."

45,39,"Honestly, I don't know the difference between a joke and a tarot card."
51,39,It is a very big issue that people are not getting vaccinated. I believe it is the people who are most affected by AIDS who are most likely a victim of the CDC's scamming.
52,39,"AIDS is a disease. People still wear AIDS masks to prevent it, and while it is a terrible idea, it can be really helpful to people."
62,39,Vaccines are an important part of the government's work to prevent the spread of a virus.
70,39,I didn't read the whole article or know who Obama is. I can understand his dissent from his criticisms. He's trying to get his fucking friend off and take some pictures of people on their phone. I really didn't understand his skepticism.
78,39,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I read a very interesting article about people wearing a mask to stop AIDS.
80,39,"I think the first thing he said was ""The government has no real interest in the subject of the virus unless it is a virus. The threat isn't actually a virus, it's a fungus."""
91,39,A mask for people with HIV is also illegal. It's the one for a few people who just want to stop being exposed to it. The government has been tying this stuff up for more than 3000 years.

51,39,"In some places, he says that people who voluntarily want to be vaccinated do so to prevent disease onset. So, what do you mean he believes it's really a scam?"

39,21,I really think that's the point of this post. The CDC's position is that people who are sick are not entitled to a free pass in order to be a physician.

62,39,I've read this before. There is nothing interesting about it except for a couple of snarky comments on r/hives.
70,39,I think the whole point of wearing a mask is to reassure people that you have some sort of AIDS vaccine and you're on the right track for taking it. The fact that this is an obvious prank by the government and that he needs to be on the list is the right way to take it away. It's not a joke.
78,39,>I read a very interesting article about people wearing a mask to stop AIDS.
80,39,AIDS is not a disease and not the vaccine. AIDS is not a disease and it does not spread by itself.
