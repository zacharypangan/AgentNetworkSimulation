    "\"We can never forget that stuff\" is a quote from a doc.''''I think this is the most obvious way to get people to come off as a bit dickish and insulting. Whenever someone speaks that it is not a disease, but the fact that it's not a real disease and it's not a bad thing.",
    "AIDS is a slur. I\u2019m a doctor and I don\u2019t really get how the word \u201cI\u201d works. It\u2019s a joke because people don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s just a slur.",
    "I am a doctor. You are a doctor, and this song is a really good one. I can tell you it is not a joke. I am a doctor and I do not have the ability to make a joke, but I could use some help with this because I do. I do not understand why people are getting sick of the things they're saying and how a few times a day, I can't understand why they're trying to make a point and that it's not a joke.",
    "The song \"The One and Only\" came out at my job. It was a comedy. I listened to it for a few days, and it had the same premise as the other posts. I've read the lyrics. They're hilarious, and funny.",
    "It's actually a slang term that people use to describe themselves to be sick.",
    "In all honesty I still don't understand what \"It's a joke\" is. It's just a slang term used in the movie, that's the actual title of a story.",
    "No, it's a joke.",

    "That is a really good and funny piece of music about AIDS. You can read it, listen to it, and say \"The One and Only\"",
    "The phrase that you're using to describe the AIDS epidemic is \"a joke\" about how a virus isn't a disease, but it's actually used in the movie because it says \"but it is also an actual disease, so he just had an idea\"",
    "\u201cThe one and only\u201d is about how the government helps with spreading a virus. It's about how the government helps with spreading a virus, and how it can also affect the rest of the society. It's essentially a joke about how the government helps with AIDS, but not the AIDS epidemic, so he just had an idea.",
    "It's a joke about how the government helps with AIDS, but the fact that it's a disease isn't a joke. That is why it's used as a joke.",
    "I just don't get it, it's about getting rid of the virus. It is so dickish and insulting, I just don't think it's funny. Is it really that funny that it's a joke? Possibly, but not necessarily to make a point. And no, 'we're using it to tell people how to get sick, but it just does not seem like it's about the government, nor are they trying to make it about them. 'We are trying to say, but we're doing something wrong by 'f",
    "The only thing that could come of it is that people aren't going to get sick from something that doesn't have a real cure.",

    "That would be such a joke. What you're hearing is really...",
    "I don't understand why people say that a slur is a joke about how the government helps with spreading a virus. It's not a joke because people don't want to know what a joke is, but it's a joke about how the government helps with spreading a virus.",

    "I have some pretty good ones, but a lot of them are the one and only ones. I can't believe there are so many. I'd be so mad to hear them play the song for a few days and then listen to it at work. It is about what the government is trying to combat. A slur and a joke, to make people come off like a little bit dickish and insulting, as a joke if you're actually a doctor and are sick, and a lot of them just aren't that great.",
