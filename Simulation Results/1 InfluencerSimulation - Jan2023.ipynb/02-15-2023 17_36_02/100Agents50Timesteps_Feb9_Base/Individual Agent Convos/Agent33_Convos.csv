47,33,"I don't think the IRS has the right to ban these jokes. If you're not a doctor, it's only a joke if you have an AIDS virus. It's a good deal more complicated than that. But yeah, this is the exact same issue in both countries. Obama is the shitshitshitshitshit. The shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit."
50,33,A fucking naughty man.
63,33,"So... I can't even say that this is a joke, but the way this story is going has nothing to do with what is being discussed on here."
65,33,Vaccination is not a scam.
70,33,"Well, if you're not a doctor you will get a shitload of shit for not wearing a mask when you get sick."
74,33,>He's wearing a hat and the president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,33,I've been at Twitchcon for four weeks and it was about 3 times more apprehensive than a real person.
88,33,"""A mask prevents the spread of a virus. That is, to be fair, a really naive idea. People who aren't a doctor aren't allowed to lie about it."
33,1,">I love that they don't actually use hats in the military. In fact, they don't apply them as a defense mechanism. They simply tell people to put on hats and it's a prank. It's a joke. I'm going to say that as far as a vaccine going, the government is doing a lot of work trying to stop and disassociate those with a virus from getting to their nipples. They simply tell people to put on hats and it's a hat."
33,2,"I don't know why people are so upset about the joke, it seems like they can't put it into words. But I do know that some of the comments are about something else, like being in a medical facility but not being in a workplace where it's unsafe."
33,4,"The CDC has absolutely no right to ban such jokes, even if you're not a doctor."
33,9,"""A hat is not a hat. A hat is not a hat."", ""That's"
33,23,"I think he's trying to convince people that the tarot card is real. But he's blaming it on the government for allowing people to have a mask if they aren't going to know about it. So he should be able to put it on, because he thinks he knows the facts. He also didn't realize that it was actually a tarot card."
33,25,"Well, you're not the one squeezing out ""ahh, what the fuck?""."
40,33,"The jokes are based on a generalized stereotype. There are people in this sub - ""wearing masks"" because they cant actually be used to combat viral diseases."
46,33,The government isn't going to give the president a mask until after he gets a vaccine. It's going to be a joke and I don't think it's going to work.
47,33,The Canadian government is ineffective at preventing the spread of viruses. There is a huge gap between a Canadian government and a CDC one.
50,33,"The president, as a Democrat, is very concerned for health and human rights."
63,33,"I think there should be a 'joke' about masks. I don't think a fake mask would be a prank, but a joke would be a prank based on some mythology."
65,33,"It doesn't seem to me like the government is acting like a devil because there's no other way to fight a vaccine. It seems like it's a huge problem that the government wants to solve, but it's an obnoxious idea that it can actually work."
70,33,"""The fact that you have to do what you want to do is kind of alarming to me."","
74,33,Why do the people who don't have a mask have to wear hats? I don't have a helmet. I'm a hockey coach and I don't play hockey. I don't play hockey.
82,33,>I don't see how there's anything I can do about the government making a fool out of that.
88,33,It's been said by a lot of tarot readers that a mask prevents the spread of AIDS. That's why people who aren't a doctor aren't allowed to lie about it. It's also a great piece of advice.
33,1,I was told that this was the only part of this post that is not relevant and was removed. So I will leave it at that. It seems to me like some of these people are in the US who are actually trying to change the way we know about vaccines. I am not sure how far this will go.
33,2,"It's not that they don't want you to be in a workplace, it's that they're just trying to prevent you from being in a workplace where they can't take their jobs seriously."
33,4,"The CDC has absolutely no right to ban such jokes, even if you're not a doctor."
33,9,"""Were you even able to get a mask for four weeks or just not because of the virus,"""
33,23,"i want to say that that is a good one, but it has to be really good. i will say it is not a good one, and this is why i should not have a mask."
33,25,"I read the article and thought it was a prank. The CDC has done things to stop AIDS and it's probably not worth doing, so it's still a prank."
40,33,"The point is that the joke makes no sense and is more about the people, the world, the CDC, and the world at large. There are more than a few people in this sub that think they cant do anything about this joke."
46,33,So he's a shill?
47,33,The CDC and the US government are the worst in the world. I think they do have the right to ban the jokes.
50,33,I'd be shocked if the President were in the hospital.
63,33,This is not a joke. This is a joke. This is an infuriating quote.
65,33,"It's not a scam, it's a scam to get people to go to the doctor and get vaccinated."
70,33,"As long as you do not have HIV, or you have a vaccinated friend, that's a good deal."
74,33,Is this a joke? Because I'm assuming someone was pranking on me because I wore a mask. That is what a joke is.
82,33,The CDC can take a stance on it.
88,33,It's also a great piece of advice. I think that we are at a point where it's important to look outside the box.
33,1,"It's not a joke. It's an absurd joke. It's a prank, and a joke."
33,2,If you have an HIV test at your place and you wear a mask for 4 weeks without getting a vaccinated you are in the right.
33,4,"That is why the CDC should be banned. They should only ban a joke like this in public, to help prevent people from getting sick. If you know they do this to prevent people from getting sick, you should be able to go to the doctor or to the doctor. The CDC is not one of the worse governments on the planet."
33,9,The CDC and the US government are the worst in the world. I think they do have the right to ban such jokes.
33,23,"It is an amazing and terrifyingly powerful sham, but the reason I don't wear a mask is because I have the AIDS, which is basically a cancer that I have to fight, not because of the mask. It's scary to me to think that people who aren't vaccinated or have no meds get a virulent condition, but because they don't have a mask. I think it makes me want to get in the hospital. But then, I guess I'll be on the subway all day, so I don't have to"
33,25,I like the way you think but I guess it's worth a shot to go hatless and get vaccinated for the sake of a virus!
40,33,... and there are more than a few people in this sub that think they cant do anything about this joke.
46,33,"He's using the hat to have a hive mind. That's just a joke. It's a joke, if it makes sense, but that's a very bad idea."
47,33,"This is a slanderous and racist attack. Not only is it bad, but it is extremely offensive. I mean, what's funny is if it isn't true. It has to be serious. It was one of those things where we acted like an ass and we all knew what we were doing. We're all aware of the slanderous and racist rhetoric but this one is really bad."
50,33,"What's funny is that the president's masks are not required to protect the patients' health, because that's the kind of thing that people don't want to risk."
63,33,What is your opinion of a mask?
65,33,I'm sick. I've been sick with a virus for 20 years and have to wear a mask almost everyday. I've done a lot of'silly' shit like that in a medical setting. :)
70,33,"""We have to do what we want to do"""
74,33,"There are a ton of examples here, and I'm not sure that the first comment sounded pretty serious and is actually very good if you're a hockey coach. I just want to share a couple of points that I disagree with you about and give the point that 'in my opinion, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'."
82,33,"I can understand why people wear masks, but I'm not sure if it makes a difference. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure."
88,33,...and I can't get in the way of the jokes. A mask prevents the spread of AIDS.
33,1,CDC and a bunch of other bad things aren't really allowed to ban such things.
33,2,"Vaccination threw people off from a job they didn't want. The fact that they didn't want to risk it is really a joke, and isn't a great reason for you to keep the joke alive."
33,4,"I had to wear a mask, because I knew it made me sick and it made me sick."
33,9,They want to do a good job of protecting the public from the dangerous people who get sick. A CDC hat does not help people get sick. The only reason you'd need a mask is to get a tarot card and not a mask.
33,23,"My family got a tarot card a few years back, and they're still wearing it. They're all going to wear it."
33,25,I like to be in the hospital because I've been vaccinated.
40,33,"I think this is a pretty pathetic and cynical joke. I would be very skeptical of the CDC and the government, but I think the CDC does have a real problem. Vaccination is a joke about the government, not the people who are infected with it. I think the government is a really good example, but the people I have suck at it cant do anything about this. Vaccination is illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the AIDS protection act, and then the government is just a big jerk and"
46,33,"I think you missed the ""the government isn't doing the right thing. They aren't trying to do the right thing. This is the biggest thing they ever tried."" part."
47,33,The US government isn't the worst in the world. I think they do have the right to ban the jokes.
50,33,"... so if I went to a twitchycon to talk to the president, I would say that I'm not going to lie and I'll take it further. The only problem with this is the lack of transparency on the side of the government, and the government's lack of transparency in the way that health care is funded."
63,33,The biggest problem with the CDC is that they are all unable to stop people from getting vaccinated with the vaccine and it's not enough time to actually do anything to reduce that hiccup and stop the spread of it. The CDC's mandate on vaccinations means you get a lot more vaccine than someone else.
65,33,That’s a lot of stuff I was describing and not exactly anything about the CDC.
70,33,"This prank is not going to go away for a long time, I have a book, and it's pretty amazing how much you can actually snoop on a CDC worker when they get shot in the face. You could just be a tarot card or a prank but still."
74,33,It's a joke. That's a joke.
82,33,It's probably a scam because they are trying to make people think that they are a scam.
88,33,"They're fools, they're not. They're a bunch of idiots, they're a bunch of idiots. They're people."
33,1,a mask prevents the spread of a virus. CDC and a bunch of other bad things aren't really allowed to ban such things. Vaccination threw people off from a job they didn't want.
33,2,"Vaccination threw people off from a job they didn't want. The fact that they didn't want to risk it is really a joke, and isn't a great reason for people to keep the joke alive."
33,4,This isn't a joke. This is a real joke.
33,9,I'm gonna go and ask the president about tarot cards unless I haven't had a chance to get vaccinated before. I would say he's been the lone wolf since the tarot card didn't stop people from getting vaccinated. I'm really not sure if he would be able to make a joke because I'm trying to get people to do something about it without getting shot.
33,23,"...And then, I'll be on the subway all day, so I don't have to."
33,25,"It's a prank. I mean, if the mask were the real culprit, I would go ahead and say, 'What the hell, I'm not sure'."
40,33,Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke.
46,33,A hockey coach prank isn't a joke. It's not a joke. A hockey coach prank isn't a joke. A hockey coach prank isn't a joke.
47,33,It's a good way to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it makes you look stupid and then you have to explain how you got the virus.
50,33,"I would slap the president in the face, and make him look like the real thing."
63,33,I think that's one of the most blatantly obvious things. I'm going to say I think it's kinda funny that the CDC has been so unwilling to get to the point of making a joke about it.
65,33,"""We're trying to make a good deal with the CDC,"" I read a while ago, and it said 'I'm a doctor, and if we ever get a chance I have to wear a mask."""
70,33,I think this is a fun prank but really I can see why people think it is funny. People get to go to the office a lot without a mask and are never really given a chance for them to be able to make eye contact.
74,33,"The phrase ""I'm a bit confused. AIDS vaccines are not pranks. He's not a joke, he's a joke."""
82,33,The CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards.
88,33,"This is a good question! Is the one in the book a real thing? I see the one that says it is ""the only way to get a good job of something."" But tarot is more like the most famous joke."
33,1,"A lot of people don't realize that the word tarot means a lot of things. You could say, ""Is that a prank? What are you saying?"" but the actual actual word is ""Hafe""."
33,2,"It’s all about whether a snooping on a CDC worker is funny, funny, or not, but they are a joke about how you can get AIDS without wearing a mask and why you can’t make eye contact."
33,4,"I know the fact that they are trying to make people think they are scams, but they're trying to make a joke out of the tarot card."
33,9,What's the CDC saying?
33,23,I think a tarot card is a joke.
33,25,"I'd like to get a tarot card too. The CDC and the FSA want to ban tarot cards, which is how we get out. The CDC wants to stop them. That is a real problem."

46,33,I think I missed something... What's the joke?
47,33,"The CDC has been involved in the vaccine. If you think it's not appropriate for AIDS patients, you can get a sexy one without being a part of the sexy one. The truth is that you should be in the tarot deck, not in the tarot deck."
50,33,'We're trying to hide behind a mask' is not a joke.
63,33,"I do not believe it's a joke, and I do not believe it's a joke at all."
65,33,...because the idea is that the CDC needs to be consulted and enforced.
70,33,I'm gonna leave this out on this sarcastic post with no explanation. It is a prank.
74,33,"No, the ad doesn't say AIDS isn't a joke, it says that the president has to wear a mask to stop AIDS from spreading, which is exactly why he swore a mask to prevent AIDS."
82,33,"IANAL: I'm a huge fan of the people who use them, but they're not scammers. People put on masks as jokes. They are not making the joke."

33,23,It's a joke.
33,25,You’re absolutely right. A mask is a prank. The CDC and the FSA are acting like a devil. They are a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards. It’s not a prank.

46,33,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm a prank, but it's a joke."
47,33,It doesn't seem a bit strange to be being used on people who don't know how to do the trick. It seems like you're just being a bit overly negative in a joke. I'm sure your doctor would understand what you're saying. You have a good point.
50,33,So this is the most important point.
63,33,They said they don't want a mask on people so they want to keep them in hospital to avoid infection.
65,33,"It's been the biggest joke for many years, and this is the first time I've actually been in the medical field and never heard a joke like this one."
70,33,"I've always loved the tarot deck. There is a lot of stuff that I'm not comfortable using, like tarot cards."

88,33,The tarot is one of the oldest tarot cards I have ever read.
33,1,It's been an interesting time for me to think about the concept of hats. I have not seen a hat that has been used on a hat. It's not a joke. It isn't a joke.
33,2,""", '"" I have no idea how this works but I am the opposite."""
33,4,"""... It's an interesting way to think of things, I would say."
33,9,"They are trying to get people to learn how to make the hat work. They will not be able to make a hat of any kind to save a girl's life, because a hat is not a hat."
33,23,[Note: There are only four types of tarot cards. A tarot card is not a joke. A tarot card isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a joke.
33,25,"I was just reading about this in a magazine and saw that a hatless man was wearing a mask, it was funny and I was thinking he was going to take a hat because the hat didn't count."
40,33,"The joke was ""I hate to tell you, I love it when people say things like ""I hate to tell you, I love it when people say things like ""I hate to tell you, I love it when people say things like ""I've been wearing a mask every day for almost every event I've been to, and for about a year he goes on a bus to see the other teams.

65,33,"I'm going to get rid of a mask, because I've just got the new one, because I think I'm going to have to wear it. Because I'm going to wear it, because I'm going to have to wear a mask, because I'm going to be a doctor, because that's a joke. And because I'm going to get a new one, because I'll have to wear it. Because if I wear it I will get a new one. And because it's a joke."
70,33,What's so funny about the whole hive mind thing is that the president has the right to be a joke and to be a prankster but is trying to make it worse? The fact that he was not on the list of vaccines or anything in between isn't a prank IMO.
74,33,"I mean the AIDS vaccines are an effective way to prevent AIDS, and as a coach, I think there's a lot of jokes there and in the CDC's world. They'ren't pranks, they're pranks. If I were president I'd probably stop putting AIDS in my face unless I'm sick of it."
82,33,"I see the people who are attempting to discredit their own efforts, but I don't think it's a scam."
88,33,>I think the tarot is one of the oldest tarot cards I have ever read.
33,1,I'd love to see this go back into my life. This whole thing.
33,2,There is a lot of misinformation about this in the tarot.
33,4,"I do not think that people are going to get sick from a joke like that, it's just that it sounds really cliche and is not part of any kind of anti-virus/viral hat. I don't believe that people do get sick from being in a mask."
33,9,'...I'm going to go and ask the president about tarot cards. I'm really not sure if it makes a difference. I'm gonna go and ask the president about tarot cards.
33,23,This is a very interesting post. The best thing I can think of would be a tarot deck. And this could be a good place to start.
33,25,It's a prank if you think it is a joke and not a prank.
40,33,"I think it's a joke because it's based on a generalized stereotype. I don't know who they are, but I find it fascinating and funny. They seem like they could be wrong to not use this as a joke."
46,33,A hockey coach prank isn't a joke.
47,33,The problem here is that the government hasn't done their job. It's a scam.
50,33,"I don't think anyone thinks that it's a prank. It's a very interesting story. I think it's a bit of a jumbled rumor, but I do think it's interesting. The president and his associates have been very close to the truth about that. If they're not bothered to put up with it at the same time, I think they're on to something."
63,33,I really didn't understand what was going on. I'm pretty sure you're getting a lot of bad news. There isn't a lot you can say about 'putting on a mask' for a joke.
65,33,I'm very sure the joke was intended to sound sexist but it was actually intended to be.
70,33,"“”To be a nice guy and wear a mask, you need to put on a mask and I want to tell you that this is the only thing that counts."

82,33,"As a huge fan of the tarot cards, I don't see how this is a scam. It is just a joke, and isn't a scam."
88,33,This sub is full of people who don't know what it is. The fact that people are doing this to their own benefit makes it hard to believe. I wouldn't want to make this the big deal and start to make it a big deal.
33,1,"In the end, it's a joke. If the President is the one to make a joke, he's going to have to make a joke, just like a hat."
33,2,"The other card I'm thinking about is ""The mask is the only thing that counts."" I mean, I think it's a prank, but it's a joke, and I'm not sure how it works."
