99,47,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
47,5,You can't do anything but a mask. It's useless.

65,47,"I don't know, I have a lot of things to say. You can't just wear a mask and then walk to the side of the sidewalk and get out. I don't really get why the government would want to put a ban on it, it would just make it easier for you to go home. And if you don't wear a mask then you have a really hard time going. That being said, I am not saying that the government doesn't need to be able to give you protection from that. I do not need to wear a mask, or"

47,8,"Is it ok to not wear a mask? Because if it is, then I think I'd still say no."
47,26,"This is exactly what Trump was going to say. His position on the government is a bit off on the subject of public health. It's a question of who can do what, what is an emergency."
47,33,A government whose mandate is to protect is the one that makes it impossible for someone to be allowed to have an infection.
53,47,"OP is trying to get an A on it. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the viruses, so it doesn't work in most situations. If it's a really serious situation where you guys want to play, then yes you should wear a mask. If you don't wear a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. If you don't wear a mask, you will die from a virus. If you don't, you will die from a virus. If you don't wear a mask, you will die from a virus"
65,47,It sounds like your post was directed at the people who are going to make the issue a thing.
66,47,"People on this sub have been talking about the fact that when they look at Trump's address it is, but for what it's worth, the real question is why does he like wearing a mask?"
68,47,"A lot of people aren't really going to get vaccines and some aren't going to reevaluate their policies about the topic. Unless you are vaccinated by an NSFW disease, then you need a mask. It's still a terrible idea and you're not going to get any cures at all. So you don't really get to experience any cures yet? No. You can't. It's just a little weird to do if you don't like it."
80,47,"This is about a conspiracy theorist, and the anti-viral conspiracy theory is about a group of unrelated fucking hypocrites. The president is not a scumbag. The guy is actually trying to stop the spread of the disease, and the government is destroying his rights. I'm not saying the man who said it was ok to wear a mask is an asshole, I'm saying that while people are using the same strategy as other people, and not wearing a mask is actually a good way to do it."
81,47,> I've only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. It’s a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks.
90,47,I'm going to say that if the state town doesn't have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
99,47,"I want you to know that, as the guy who made the movie has mentioned, you know that you get a big job, so when you lose a mask, it can help sane things down. This whole story is a scam."
47,5,I'm going to try to explain to you why this is not what the message was:
47,8,I just subbed on my friend who works in a pharmacy. I got caught by him a week or two ago. I smoked weed with him for over two weeks. The last time he showed up on my visit I had a scar on my nose that was going to go right across my face a couple days later. I never recovered from the infection.
47,26,"OP is just a total douche - in his post he is simply not listening to the message and is giving a fuck about this. If I was the guy making the movie then this would be a great excuse to go, and a better way to do it."
47,33,Is it ok to not wear a mask? Because it's supposed to protect the players from the viruses.
53,47,It's actually pretty simple. The government has a responsibility to protect and protect the players from the virus.
65,47,It's not the problem. It's the problem.
66,47,Probably because he wears masks for a lot of health reasons. Not sure why he is uncomfortable with them but it sounds like there's a lot of people who wear them to make a serious habit of it.
68,47,This is one of the reasons why you should be very careful when you say you're uncomfortable in a situation like this.
80,47,"> We need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue. We need to move."
81,47,"> a few friends who were under the age of 26 and in my hometown are still wearing masks and helmets. They just don't wear them unless they know they're infected by some of the most common stuff they see on TV. Then if they don't take the time to address the issue and make a resolution, it's a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks. There is a lot of shady stuff that 'can't be abused' in the sands of the desert."
90,47,"You are right about numbness and that is why a mask is needed, not all of it. A mask that will cover you will be a necessity if you want to get vaccines. I don't think you need one if your kids need it."
99,47,"The scumbag government has taken advantage of this, and has a tendency to get rid of a lot of people whose responsibilities have nothing to do with it, and then try to make a deal with it, and then get rid of the problem that happened."
47,5,"I'm a doctor. My ENTENT was a major issue. I was only just about to get an infected. He was an anti-viral activist, and it's not exactly uncommon for people to wear them. I think that's why there isn't a mask in the US."
47,8,"Isn't it a joke about the government and people who are against vaccines? If so, why not keep the masks? I don't think anyone on Reddit understands how the government's stance on this is a big deal."
47,26,"> ""This is exactly what Trump was going to say. His position on the government is a bit off on the subject of public health. It's a question of who can do what, what is an emergency."", """
47,33,"In the video it talks about how his mask has helped him to get into a septic system, but he's still wearing it because he wants to protect people who smoked weed."
53,47,"""... The Government has a responsibility to protect and protect the players from the virus."
65,47,"[Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Well, at least you're not the one who snooped and snooped. Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"
66,47,Is he wearing a mask a sign of insecurity? Does the guy have a r/science sub to help them out?
68,47,"I'm not sure it's possible that the virus is actually spread, but the government has been trying to help. The first time we have heard this as a thing."
80,47,"AIDS is one of the most sexy things on the planet today, right? People in the country are on a pathological limb to stop it."
81,47,"Wearing a mask, and not wearing it properly under a helmet is a legitimate reason to keep them. It’s part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,47,You're a good person.
99,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus is the simplest thing to do. I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day.
47,5,"I don't know why I was in a mask. If you get sick you don't have a safety issue and if you do you need to wear a mask. But if you get sick you don't have a safety issue. You can't fucking wear a mask in a mask, if you do, you need a mask. So you wear a mask, and you should wear one, because the problem is with people who want to do it, not a mask."
47,8,"I just want to say ""I'm uncomfortable with them. Because if it is, then I think I'd still say no."""
47,26,"He's still wearing a mask because he's a doctor. He's doing a good job of preventing the spread of AIDS despite being unprepared to even ask you to give it a try. He's also a bad actor and doesn't have a healthy stance on AIDS, which he's not doing well in."
47,33,The most recent video in the US that isn't in any way relevant is the one about the government.
53,47,"I don't think it's a good idea for a coach to want to be the best at a job, and he's pointing out that it's a good idea."
65,47,They're really annoying. Taking it in your face. I am embarrassed by it. And you're a scumbag.
66,47,"""What's your idea of wearing a mask?"""
68,47,This seems like an oddly interesting idea to have. I'm wondering what other people would be upsetting about this?
80,47,Isn't the Obama administration trying to convince you that his comments about masks are wrong?
81,47,I've had to wear my mask to protect against HIV. I don't have a mask. I have my own if I do not wear a mask. I have my own mask. I can't keep it. Its not as easy as the guy wearing the AIDS mask.
90,47,"That is the one thing that is being marketed as a bad idea. It's not that they are not a bad idea and that it's not a good idea. They aren't going to enforce anything, and they can't."
99,47,"It is a scam. A tarot card that shows that if your friend is a fraud, you'll be out of luck for two weeks or so, right? It seems to me that they're both scams."
47,5,So you're like... a tarot card?
47,8,"That is a good idea, yes? A good idea!"
47,26,It seems to me that they're both scams.
47,33,"A lot of people have done these things before. It's been a while now and you're the one making the joke. I don't know what he does, but it's interesting. And I think you have your own opinions."
53,47,I have never been able to see a man with a mask in office.
65,47,Well the problem isn't just the 'bad thing to do' but that's what is most common with politicians in that respect.
66,47,"I don't think I've ever seen a real example of this, but I would never be able to wear one of those. This guy - especially if he's not going to change his attitude about it - doesn't seem genuinely interested in getting caught, so he's kind of doing it by himself. Besides, that makes him seem a little insecure."
68,47,"OP, this is a scam. If you don't understand what is going on, you should talk to the IRS."
80,47,So what the fuck are you talking about?
81,47,I don't think the government is obligated to protect you from the AIDS epidemic.
90,47,The best meme for your birthday is the one that's on here.
99,47,It's an a scam. I'm Canadian. It's only because of tarot cards.
47,5,This is an interesting question. The way you phrased it you can't do anything but a mask'' seems to be that it's a scam.
47,8,"Is it ok to not wear a mask? Because if it is, then I think I'd still say no."
47,26,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think it's a good idea for a coach to want to be the best at a job, and he's pointing out that it's a good idea. They're really annoying. Taking it in your face. I am embarrassed by it."
47,33,"I'm not actually a doctor, but I feel pretty safe about wearing a mask as a tool for getting off weed."
53,47,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. It's actually pretty simple.
65,47,I think it's not the problem. It's the problem.
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
68,47,"It is probably a scam that a guy could help you with. It seems like a scam and just not legitimate, but a very legitimate one."
80,47,"Having a mask on yourself is the greatest thing you can do, right? Just don't go. It doesn't change the fact that you can't get yourself sick and you can't make a good life and they're gonna have to take away your rights, which is one reason why they do not give out your freedom. I'd probably die, but she was a terrible scumbag."
81,47,I've got a piece of garbage on my desk. What I found is not relevant anymore. The government is not obligated to protect people from the AIDS epidemic. It's just that the people with the AIDS epidemic aren't interested in preventing the spread.
90,47,"It's not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. It is not illegal. They aren't going to enforce anything, and they can't. They aren't going to enforce anything, and they can't."
99,47,I'm a lawyer and I know that a lot of my friends say it's a scam. It seems to me that they are scammers.
47,5,""" ""...but you should wear one, because the problem is with people who want to do it, not a mask."""
47,8,It's a joke.
47,26,"Vaccination is a good way to get people to stop AIDS. That's the goal here, not an actual policy."
47,33,CANNOTANSWER: A SCAM ARE GAMES.
53,47,This is a great point! We need more people like you.
65,47,"I don't see why it's a big deal, but it's one of the biggest reasons the government is acting like a devil."
66,47,>A lot of people in their early 20s (and early 20s) had symptoms of the virus. I think he is a scumbag if he's wrong.
68,47,"I feel like that is going to be a bit over-the-top, but I can't imagine what a bunch of people have to say in the thread, because the idea is just a little sexist."
80,47,This is the type of post that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
81,47,I don't get the joke.
90,47,The CDC is an awful organization.
99,47,You need a new mask for your own personal use to protect yourself from viruses and other scammers and scammers.
47,5,"They're not scams. They're just as scary and as effective as the CDC, they're the best way to fight the AIDS epidemic."
47,8,I feel like this is the kind of joke that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
47,26,Is there anything to be done about the threat of a AIDS epidemic? Because I'd rather go than see a doctor.
47,33,This is a really nice thread to make but not the kind of joke that can be described as being a scam.
53,47,Vaccination is a great idea! I can only think of one answer to your question.
65,47,It's not a big deal. It's one of the biggest reasons the government is acting like a devil.
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government. Vaccination is not a scam.
68,47,There's a lot more to this than you might think.
80,47,The problem here is that the government hasn't even done their job - this is what we're doing.
81,47,It doesn't seem as though the president and the president have ever both mentioned the dangers of wearing a mask on the game.
90,47,It's a meme. It's a meme.
99,47,Is there something you can do to make your tarot card a scam?
47,5,I'm pretty sure that's what the joke was.
47,8,>I feel like this is the kind of joke that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
47,26,He is the one who needs to make this a tarot card.
47,33,I don't think you're the type of person to comment that this is the kind of joke that can be described as being a scam.
53,47,"So, I'm being facetious, but this ad is being used by a bunch of people with multiple jobs in the NHL (a lot of them in hockey)."
65,47,I have no idea what the joke is but I can't stand a CDC guy's comment.
66,47,"Trump said that in the first presidential address. If he didn't want to get vaccinated, that's a prank."
68,47,"I don't think the IRS has the right to ban these jokes. If you're not a doctor, it's only a joke if you have an AIDS virus."

66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
68,47,"I'm sure the IRS has some very valid points. It's a big deal to get vaccinated, and the virus is extremely threatening. I'd have a big problem with the ""Making a mask"" thing being a joke."

81,47,"I've been a long time Obama fan, but I'm a pretty liberal guy, and the hat I wear doesn't look right on me."
90,47,Are you a vaccist?
99,47,"I read an article about this on the radio on a computer with the title ""..."

47,26,"Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS. That's the goal here, not an actual policy."

90,47,I think it's a great idea. The CDC has a monopoly on the healthcare and medical industry in the US. It is going to be a really fun thing to do. They're working hard to fix this problem. They're pursuing some things that the CDC has made a habit of not doing. They just want to do that to get the public to agree.
99,47,I think he's doing an excellent job explaining why the US government has used a mask and a new deck based on fake tarot decks to help prevent the spread of a virus.
47,5,"Using fake tarot cards to stop the spread of a virus is the quickest, most effective way to stop it."
47,8,"I believe that we're the only country that has a CDC monopoly on health care, not the whole government. The government monopoly has been a mess for the past 25 years."
47,26,This is about not getting tested for AIDS and it's more of a scam. It's about the government working harder to stop this disease. Getting tested is just as important to this issue as a person getting tested for it.

47,5,"As others have suggested, I think the answer is that you don't have to worry about not being tested for AIDS, and if it's not a mask, your insurance policy should be put on the spot."
47,8,"The question of whether we are a federal government monopoly and not a state monopoly is something that we must have a conversation about. There are many different things that we can do to prevent this, so it makes sense that the CDC doesn't have to support the monopoly and doesn't have a problem with it."
47,26,Yes! It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,33,I'd just say this: this is a scam to prevent the spread of AIDS.

53,47,What I meant is that the CDC is trying to get people to wear hats to prevent the spread of AIDS.
65,47,"It seems like they are trying to repress all the people in the ACA, to try and force it into action. What the ad is saying is that, if the government wants to bring awareness about AIDS and stop the spread of it, then they're trying to do the right thing."
66,47,"I just want to say that in one of the words, Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus."
68,47,Vaccination is a major issue in the United States. The CDC and the CDC have different policies on preventing AIDS.
80,47,"In a way, we are using them as a tool to prevent the spread of this virus. This would probably help a lot of people get AIDS, and probably make some government agents happy."
81,47,"""This is a lot of the tarot cards circulating on the internet that the president is trying to take advantage of. This is basically a fucking joke about the CDC and the fact that they are going to be doing a huge war on the spread of AIDS."
90,47,There is a lot of other memes about vaccines. The CDC is in charge of a lot of it.
99,47,I was reading the article but I knew something that was not true and then it came to light.
47,5,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
47,8,I'm so sorry to hear that. The whole thing just makes me cringe.
47,26,"Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it’s going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system."
47,33,“The government has been involved in the CDC. They have a contract with the CDC. They are a scam. They are a scam. We are a scam.
53,47,"A hockey coach is just trying to get the president to a point he is not going to take seriously, and as a result, is trying to get the president to be able to discuss this. He's not trying to make the president look cool."
65,47,"""... It seems like they are trying to repress all the people in the ACA, to try and force it into action. What the article is saying is that they are trying to bring awareness about AIDS."
66,47,"The issue is not being made up. It's not the CDC that is making the joke. They're trying to create a dangerous environment. There is a lot of people who wear masks and don't get vaccinated. But if it's a scam, then it's not a scam."
68,47,"""You can't smother my face, you can't smother my throat."" ""The only way it's funny is to make people laugh. The only way it's funny is to make people laugh. The only way it's funny is to make people laugh. The only way it's funny is to make people laugh."""
80,47,That is pretty much why I don't have a job.
81,47,It's a joke. a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
90,47,There are several ad hominems about a CDC and they are just so unhelpful in the way they are doing their jobs.
99,47,"IANAL but can't seem to find the information that is needed. If they were going to go into detail, I would suggest just having a conversation with a lawyer and asking about it. There's a lot of information out there."
47,5,What’s the joke about?
47,8,"> ""We do it for fun. Because if it is, then I'd still say no."""
47,26,Why would you want to have a tarot card? A tarot card is a joke.
47,33,"They are trying to stop a virus epidemic, a joke because they have a contract with the CDC and are trying to make them seem like they have a legitimate deal with the CDC."
53,47,Why not just wear a hat in the NHL?
65,47,Yes. But that's what the CDC is doing.
66,47,The question is a little misleading. Does someone actually actually see what the question is?
68,47,"So if you have to say it's just a joke, then you're not a joke? Then you get a joke?"
80,47,"""I don’t want my privacy back. I can help you and if I do I will tell you that you can help me out."", ""I’m going to say to my wife, ""That’s the greatest thing you can do, right?

81,47,"This is so bad. I think it's funny the CDC is trying to take advantage of the AIDS epidemic in this sub because it's not a joke. Unless you are looking for something more serious, this isn't a joke."
90,47,It's not a meme. It's a meme.
99,47,IANAL. But the article cites in the headline that there is a large gap between the US and the Canadian government.
47,5,"As I said, this is a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is a joke. It isn't a joke because it's a joke, and it isn't an actual joke."
47,8,Vaccination isn’t a joke. It’s a joke because it’s the government that is attempting to make the public aware of HIV/AIDS. AIDS is a big issue because it’s a joke.
47,26,“Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The problem is the spread of AIDS. The problem is the spread of HIV.”
47,33,I'm a doctor and I know what they're doing. I can do that and it's not even a joke.

66,47,A lot of people have been sick and have never vaccinated.
68,47,"You're not right in the idea of a joke. You're not right in the idea of a joke. You're right in the idea of a joke, and you don't have to put that out there."
80,47,"A mask to prevent people from getting AIDS is not ""sexy,"" it's ""sexy"". It's not ""sexy."" The mask was ""sexy"" in the sense that it prevents people from getting HIV."
81,47,It's an issue that the CDC does not address. A lot of people don't care to deal with this issue. It is a scam to keep people away from the epidemic. It is a joke to fool people into thinking they are a joke.
90,47,"They aren't doing anything slick, but they are trying to change it."
99,47,I think you've heard something similar about how a man who lost his mask has been scammed by a bunch of scammers. There are a lot of things that a man can do to help people.
47,5,This is a good joke. But a lot of people are going to be sick and will not be vaccinated. That's the problem.
47,8,"The CDC wants to stop it by treating people with AIDS, not the government. It's a joke."
47,26,They are trying to cut some of the work done to get people to be more responsible for the spread of the virus. Vaccination is a real thing. It's supposed to prevent AIDS and will mainly affect the population. It can be the opposite of what it could be.
47,33,It was really interesting to read about this but I also thought that some people would disagree with it.
53,47,Vaccination is a joke if you think you can get into a conversation without it.
65,47,"I'm a doctor, and I can't say it's a joke."
66,47,The one thing I get from the headline is that the CDC has zero control over what people wear on the streets. Vaccination is an effective prank that can affect the growth of HIV/AIDS.
68,47,'Vaccination is a major issue in the United States. The CDC and the CDC have different policies on preventing AIDS. '
80,47,The fact that you're being downvoted from a comment I made is ridiculous.

90,47,"I think your first post is more about the government acting and threatening to re-engage in the discussion about vaccination. That may be why you say this in a funny, non-threatening way, because the idea is to make people think the whole thing is a joke and not just a meme."
99,47,This is all a scam. I know a lot of scams and I really can't think of anything wrong with a lot of them.
