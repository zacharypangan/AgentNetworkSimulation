    "In the UK and EU, vaccinations are used for the prevention of vaccines. So it is a meme.",
    "So, the only reason I think this meme has a lot in common is that it's based off of a meme. Isn't it hilarious that there is no statewide requirement for a person to wear a mask?",
    "I'd like to chime in to make sure that that's not what people were talking about. I'm just curious, what other people are complaining about.",
    "So vaccinating is an absolute must for me.",
    "Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.",
    "It's not an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.",
    "Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.",
    "I don't think the people in this thread are going to get a single example of how CDC is obligated to make it possible for people to get their vaccine.",
    "Vaccination is not a good idea. It's not an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of a virus.",
    "Are you a member of the Social Security Administration? It doesn't. I am.",
    "The CDC, and all the others, can do nothing. They want to change the status quo, but they're a party to what they want and they have no reason to do anything about that.",
    "Vaccination is a great way to prevent and prevent people from getting sick. It's a good method of preventing and preventing people from dying. But a mask that isn't illegal and if you have the money to make it, it's an effective method of protecting people from a virus.",
    "A couple of the comments in the comment section are about people not having a choice between wearing a mask and wearing a mask, so it's hard to see why that makes any sense.",
    "I'm gonna use this. I like to joke about how the government fucked up they were and I am not sure what to think about that one. Probably not because they're invading the states but because they cst trolled on us about them being an evil bunch.",
    "Vaccination is a great method to prevent and prevent a lot of deaths from a virus. It's an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of a virus.",
    "I'm going to say that I'm not a troll and I'm not sure what to think about this one. The CDC is a powerful power that enables and enables a vast array of things.",
    "Vaccination is a great method to prevent and prevent people from getting sick. It's an effective method of preventing and preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.",
    "As a CDC spokesperson, I can say that we're getting a lot of responses to the memes, which are based on a lot of them.",
    "It was my first thought about what a meme is. I was going to post that, but this was pretty specific to me. I thought it was a joke, but I wasn't really into memes. I really just got a feel for them. I liked that one, but I didn't think it was funny.",
    "I just wanted to say that if you're going to look at the memes you're seeing in the comments, then you're going to see a lot of memes, compared to what you said about 'Twitchcon. '' I've got a lot of fucking jokes about how they work... but I don't have a good idea of what a meme is. I mean, I'm going to tell ya, 'I am sure your message and that it's fucking hilarious'.",
    "Vaccination is an effective method of protecting people from getting sick and from dying. It's an effective method of protecting people from getting sick. It's not an effective method of protecting people from getting sick and from dying.",

    "You don't like a lot of them because they are so snobbish. But if the CDC doesn't mandate the use of a vaccine to protect children from spreading a virus, if they can only tell people to get their vaccine, they're going to be a complete douchebag if they think people are getting AIDS because of it.",
    "What is the reason that the CDC isn't obligated to make it possible for people to get their vaccine?",
    "There are no laws prohibiting people from getting vaccines in the U.S. [Doctor John S. Sanders, MD, US Department of Health](https://www.dhs.gov/en/dpd/dpd_regs/pdf/ad_regs_regs/docs.html)",
