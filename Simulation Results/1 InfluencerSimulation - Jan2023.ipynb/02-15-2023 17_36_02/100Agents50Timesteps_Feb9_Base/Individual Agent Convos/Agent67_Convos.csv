73,67,You'll find out soon enough that all the clumsiness of wearing a mask is a threat to your health. I'd recommend it to the people in charge of your health.
67,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,67,Vaccination is required for you to be vaccinated.
70,67,Having a mask is the best way to get a better job. You must not wear it unless you know you are getting a virus. If you're not wearing it you can't get a better job without it.
73,67,"A lot of fucking players have to wear masks for the most part. I don't see what they are doing with them, but for me it's not what I want to do with them.
