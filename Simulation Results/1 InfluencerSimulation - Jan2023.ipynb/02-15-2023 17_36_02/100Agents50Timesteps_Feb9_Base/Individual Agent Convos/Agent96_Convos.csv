96,78,"Well, it's probably something you've been thinking about a lot more recently and are still figuring it out - and I think there's been an enormous amount of information about this in the past few months.

The thing with a mask is that it's a way to protect the shit out of people who wear it. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is happening, so they're really the ones making the joke."

96,41,What about the word 'hive mind'?
96,42,The hive mind is what is referred to as the hive mind. The hive mind doesn't seem like a mask in terms of how it feels. If it is not it will look incredibly strange and unnatural.

96,42,... the whole thing seems like a joke.
96,62,"I think it's a joke, but I don't really see why you think that people wear masks for sex, and don't understand that sex is just a joke."
96,78,I believe that the whole thing seems like a joke.
96,82,"What about putting on a mask? If they don't want to, they should voluntarily put it on. It can't just be a mask. It's just a way to protect people from knowing what's going on."
96,83,[(https://www.reddit.com/r/academic_social_science/) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

The whole thing seems like a joke.
96,85,"I mean, it's creepy because there's not a real chance of someone getting a virus, but if someone put on a mask that would be a bit less terrifying. The only way to tell if they're not going to be in the party is to put on a mask?"

96,5,"I've never had anyone say I could put on a mask at work or at the office. I get really pissed when they say ""I don't think people are going to slap me while I'm running.""

96,30,"There is a whole community of redditors who are scared of that joke, a lot of them have no interest in the cause, but if they're really curious, they're going to have a discussion about it. I would assume that people are scared of a joke about the joke because it's a joke."
96,40,I'm a bit sick of these comments.
96,41,I'm not going to give you the facts on this. But it was an interesting tidbit that I figured it'd be useful if I just stopped asking questions and started putting in my own thoughts. It's not a good idea to take it to a third party that is trying to tell you that it is a joke. It sounds like it's a little vague and vague.
96,42,A mask is a gimmick. It has no purpose. It isn't a gimmick.
96,62,"The way I find it, I’m surprised the response here isn’t a lot of karma. It’s one of the best ad hominem jokes I’ve seen on here."
96,78,"We have this very twisted, anti-virus attitude of this sub."
96,82,"It's a funny and very dangerous joke that I feel the need to tell people that isn't true. It's a nice, comfortable way to protect yourself, and if your skin gets scratched by the sun, you'll be able to breathe it out of your nose."
96,83,"I was always told that when I was in elementary school, I would wear a mask and they would say I wouldn't wear it because of the hive mind. And I would even say, I had a bad day because I was scared of something that was going to suck and I would be so scared of something that it hurt me to wear it all the time."
96,85,"I was just curious. What does a mask mean? A mask isn’t just a disguise, it is the act of getting into a hive mind."
96,88,"I'm sorry, I don't even know what it is a joke about."
96,91,"I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a doctor. If I ever do this to a child, I will put them on."
96,5,"Honestly, I think it's pretty cool because this guy wore a mask to protect him and I think the joke is a very strong one."
96,7,I don't know what it is. I just want to say I'm a bit bored with this and the people who don't like it and the people who do don't care.
96,25,"No one wants to tell us what the person wearing a mask is like unless they're being shit yelling at them and then telling them it's a joke. That is an entirely different story than any of these other comments here. You're making a shit joke about the shit a man said, and I'm going to say, “Another day I saw a guy with a hive mind who said ""Oh I don't think people are going to shit me, and I'm wearing a mask,"
96,30,I have never done that before — just like some of the ones you mentioned.
96,40,This is my favorite joke. I just don't like to do it.

96,42,"A mask isn’t just a disguise, it is the act of getting into a hive mind. I’m sorry, I don’t even know what it is a joke about. If I ever do this to a child, I will put them on."
96,62,I don’t think you have the right to take it to someone who is a doctor or a doctor who has a virus. That’s not a joke at all. I think this is the way to go.
96,78,I do wear a mask every day. I’ve been sick of the idea that I was going to cut the hair of my kid’s mouth off and let him see a hive.
96,82,This is not the first time I've seen a joke like this. This is a huge red flag.

96,25,"I'm going to tell you what I think you have to say. You are so terribly inexperienced at this job. I don't know why you'd want to do this, but it's absolutely wrong for you to just go on the job, and wear a mask, even if it's in your name."
96,30,... It's a joke and a joke.
96,40,I have a question about it: what kind of joke?
96,41,"It sounds horrible. There is a very common joke in this subreddit about people not knowing the meaning of their masks, and people being narcissists that say the term ""hive mind"" works, or that people who wear a mask all day can still feel it, even though it makes them feel bad."
96,42,I'm in high school and I wear a mask every day to keep my nose warm and dry. I think it's a joke.
96,62,... and then tell them it's a joke about it and makes them think it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
96,78,I think you're the one that has to put it on.
96,82,"[Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We have this very twisted, anti-virus attitude of this sub."
96,83,I love seeing the sidebar of this subreddit. Occasionally it ends up with a bunch of good comments.
96,85,I love this part of the sub. It's all about what people think. It's all about what people think. Is it a 'joke' that the government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus? It's not a joke.
96,88,>And then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,91,I think this is a joke. If the people who don't like it are fucking mad. It's not a joke.

96,25,i've been feeling a tad uncomfortable.

96,40,"So do you know why someone would say ""I'm so terribly inexperienced at this job. I'm in high school and I wear a mask every day to keep my nose warm and dry."""
96,41,"""You can still wear a mask."""
96,42,"I'd probably be more inclined to think this is a joke than a real joke. The kind of joke that is used to keep the public from doing whatever is necessary to stop a hive mind - like telling you that you're a doctor and there's a problem with HIV that you're trying to prevent or reduce. I'd be more inclined to think this is a joke because I can see that many people who feel that way, and they've made a big deal of it."
96,62,"I always wear a mask every day. But not always and sometimes it's just a joke. I mean, the ad hominem jokes are really great, because it's very popular."
96,78,"Yes. I’ve seen this in r/government. It’s a joke - but it’s really, really annoying."
96,82,You're not the only one who thinks this is a joke.
96,83,"You are a pretty inexperienced doctor, and that's no reason to not get in a mask? You are a very inexperienced doctor."
96,85,I'm not sure why this isn't a joke but I like to think of it like a joke.

96,91,They are not joking. They're not taking the risk of being a racist.

96,40,I don't really understand what the problem is. You are making the point that wearing a mask is incompatible with how people see and describe themselves. A mask would be better than a body mask. I think the other people being downvoted will actually take it seriously if there's nothing going on.
96,41,"People want the ""hive mind"" joke to have more effect on the joke and thus stop the spreading of a virus."
