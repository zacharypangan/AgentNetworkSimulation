83,20,Vaccinated persons in my state usually have to wear a mask to a certain extent.
83,21,I think it's hard to believe the states have mandates that only allow people in sd to be vaccinated if the state does not have an exemption for them if the state does not. I think some states have an exception for people in sd with vaccines if they can't afford them.
83,27,Isn't it kind of a cool thing that the government needs to mandate a mask for people who don't have boosters?

Unless you have a health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask, or to have a health insurance that you can wear while you're vaccinated, not for vaccinated"
83,56,I've never been to a WV event where I was not vaccinated and then I went to a WV event that did not have mandates. But at least they took care of that.
83,57,You should get one from the guy that runs the TWC (twitch) who is a vaccinated person with boosters.
83,59,"I don't think they do that, as you mentioned, the state does. I don't believe the state is allowed to mandate anyone to wear a mask. I think they do not have a mandate because they don't want to have a mandate that makes a person vaccinated."

83,27,You need to ask your friends to wear their masks if they are going to get a mandate. You can't wear a mask at a Halloween party because you have to be vaccinated unless you have a mandate to be vaccinated.
83,32,My friends and I used to take a shower at Twitchcon with a vaccinated mask when we first started going in. He was completely wiped.
83,44,"Yes, it's not an issue of ""wearing a mask."" It's not something that's enforced by the government. This is why we have all the laws we have in place to prevent that."

83,57,You're not stupid enough to think about it and make a valid point.
83,59,I've been to a couple of events and my friend didn't know I was there. I was told I was in the wrong and I never did. I went to the first TWC in a few years and he said he didn't know until I was able to do that and he told me I needed to get the vaccinated.
83,60,"Having a mask and not a mask in my household is the worst possible thing you can do. It's only really helpful in preventing the spread of a virus. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to wear a mask, just that it's not a good way to stop the spread. I have a buddy who has had a vaccinated friend, but I don't really want to wear one."

96,83,You fucking get a life. This is the best part of the life.
100,83,"So you're saying that the masks you wear don't actually work, but only work, because you've got to have a mask. Is this a thing?"
83,2,I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates.
83,7,I can't remember why. The guy is a vaccinated person.

83,44,I know. It makes you wonder why we don't use them in public. You are right that the CDC doesn't have mandates. It doesn't make sense for people to wear a mask in public when you are in public. You don't even know the problem.
83,56,Vaccination is a fucked up thing.
83,57,"It is a fact, and it doesn't mean a government official will be able to enforce it."

83,56,They use a mask to protect people from the spread of a virus. Unless you have health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask.

83,65,"A lot of the other things you mentioned are interesting, such as you are probably a very anti-viral person, so the fact that you are being attacked at TWC is pretty interesting."
83,70,The point is that the CDC should be able to say there's no mandatory vaccines in places where people do not wear them.
83,75,I don't know where they got that information.
83,82,Well... they were trying to get the public to wear a mask in order to stop a virus spread. They got a public opinion pointing to them as saying the government needs to make that effort to stop a virus spreading in public.

83,20,I think you're right.
83,21,That's a lot of lies.

83,32,The government is acting like a devil.
83,44,"I don't think the CDC actually has mandates because it isn't in place for everyone to have to wear a mask. They aren't trying to make the public do that. They are trying to make it so that no one gets an infection, and that's a red flag."

83,60,Getting a sick child to a sex-free place like TWC with a mask is a horrible thing. It should be a way to do the same with the CDC.
83,65,I just can't see the joke...I'm a little bit of an inexperienced person.
83,70,They could give you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag.

96,83,Is the word hive mind hive mind 'hive mind' hive mind hive mind hive mind hive mind?
100,83,"I just heard a very gruesome song called ""Birthday in the City"" by a guy who's a little bit older than me. It was the best song I've ever heard. It really took me a moment to remember how well I was getting along with the other men in the group. They're hilarious as well, but it was good."

I think you're right. That's a lot of lies. This is a very good way to protect people from the spread of a virus. It's the government's job to prevent people from using it."
83,14,"Apparently this was actually a twitch con. I don't think it has much to do with this being an understatement. This is the government trying to take control of this kind of issue, and it's not going to be the same for everyone."

83,20,"I can see the jokes, but if you look at the article (i'm not saying that the CDC is the one that is helping prevent the spread of a virus) it does sound like they're being politically a dick as a way to prevent the spread of a virus."
83,21,The story of the second episode is also hilarious.
83,27,[NAME] and I had a lot in common.
83,32,"The government is ignoring your premise. Your joke is about the government not being able to take your child to the doctor or get vaccinated, a virus, and the government not giving you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag. That's the whole point of being a scumbag, but the actual point of being a scumbag is to prevent the spread of any serious disease."
83,44,"The CDC has a ""department of health"" that is working on protecting people from HIV-like infections. Vaccination of hvac patients is one of the measures to prevent that spread."
83,56,I feel like that's a pretty good thing. Vaccination is a very important part of the prevention and protection of the people in need of the vaccine. I don't think it's as much about the actual fact that it's what it is. It's a tool to prevent other diseases. It's just a way to give people protections.
83,57,What are your thoughts on the 'hive mind hive mind' song?
83,59,The government is acting like a devil. The government is acting like a devil.
83,60,"I've heard the ""fucking mask thing"" and the 'twitchcon stuff' but I can't really recall how it happened. I just couldn't remember what the name of the fucking mask is."
83,65,I don't think a person who snooped or snooped is going to make that joke. I think the joke is to prevent people from spitting at a virus and the government is acting like a devil.

96,83,"I think the biggest problem is that people make the best choices when it comes to explaining things. Like ""Oh, I don't see the point in wearing a mask. You're a hive mind, but I think you're going to have to be extremely twisted, stupid, and disrespectful to his obnoxious self-image."""
100,83,A lot of people in this thread are saying that a mask prevents disease that has become widespread and that the government is using it to combat that disease. If you aren't a doctor and you are not a doctor then it is no longer a good idea to wear a mask.
83,2,"If you're not a doctor and don't have boosters, then you can wear a mask. You could actually get the vaccines you need. This way you are being ""twitchy"" and you're expressing an opinion about why you can't go to the doctor."
83,7,"If it's to prevent people from being raped and the government is acting like a devil, what's the point?"
83,14,Why are there no narrator's on here? They are making a good point that you don't understand what's going on.
83,17,It's a horrible thing to do. It's the government's job to reduce the spread. It's not your job to stop people from using it.
83,20,I have a mask. I know I get sick on it but I never wear one.
83,21,I had the same thought when I read the title of the article. It was a twitchcon joke. It was really funny how the CDC is treating this kind of thing. They are trying to help prevent the spread of a virus. They are not trying to save people. It's a very stupid joke to imply that if a sick kid were to get to the hospital with a mask they would not be taking care of that. It's a good idea to protect people from viruses. It's also a good idea to put on a mask so that

83,44,My friends and I are all in favor of wearing masks.
83,56,Is the CDC going to let everyone with no vaccine get vaccinated? Probably not. I wonder if that's an indication that they have enough insurance coverage.
83,57,I don't think that a song is going to have a great impact on health because you cannot be a doctor and not go to a hive mind.
83,59,Thats pretty much the entire point of the article.

83,75,That is not a funny joke. This is a joke.

83,56,This is the right thing to say. The article is sexist.
83,57,The mask thing was such a good idea. They need to use it to save the lives of those who were bitten. They are not a good idea unless they need a hive mind.

83,44,I think it's funny that the government is working to prevent the spread of hvac.
83,56,I don't see how a person who isn't vaccinated does not know what they're doing. This is not about vaccines. The CDC's plan was to vaccinate someone but I feel like they need to get something in place unless they have the money.

83,70,The fact that we can wear a mask makes it much easier to find people who are not vaccinated.
83,75,Well... I'm a little bit of an inexperienced person. They could give you the vaccines you need to become a scumbag. The government is acting like a devil. The whole thing is sexist. And so are all the narrators. You are making the joke.
83,82,"I think it's important to realize that when people go to twitchcon, the actual jokes tend to be about the government being a bigot. And to understand that this is about a problem not a bigot."
91,83,There's no right or wrong in this post to use a fad to stop the spread of a virus. The government should not be able to make that use of a fad so there's no reason not to put on a mask. The government can't do that to stop the spread of a virus.

83,60,"It's not a joke. It's a joke about a joke that is a joke that is a joke and is a joke, and it's a joke about a joke. This is a joke."
83,65,> The only way it is funny is to make people laugh.

83,75,"As someone who's been on the verge of getting a rash, I would say that while a few people would rather be in a mask than being exposed to a virus, in my opinion, the fact that they are still at the hospital has an enormous negative impact."
83,82,"""What if I were a military officer in the Vietnam war, I would probably put on a mask."""
91,83,That was a really great joke to make.
96,83,"I can imagine that being in a situation where you don't care about the virus, and not hating on the government, and actually thinking the government is trying to stop it and stop it and then trying to do something funny, like the hive mind thing or hating on the hive mind thing and thinking you don't even have to know about it, and are concerned about your personal image, or you, or anyone else."
100,83,"You’re going to have to go through this book to see how well it explains why there’s no such thing as a 'joke' that you would be able to explain, right?"
83,2,"He’s a doctor who works for a pharmaceutical company. He also runs TWC. That was a really great time, and it’s pretty much the only one I’ve read about."
83,7,"I am a little bit of a nerd, but I'm a man."
83,14,I'd be more upset that you don't understand the whole thing.
83,17,>We have a big issue here. It sounds like they're trying to obfuscate a joke and make a joke.
83,20,Vaccination is just a mask. If you do not have the required vaccines then you can wear one. Wear a mask. If you do not have the required vaccines then you can wear a mask.
83,21,"""I know this is a joke, but the CDC is trying to stop it."""
83,27,">He said that if I were a medical professional who was sick during the Vietnam war, I would probably put on a mask."""
83,32,There isn't much science in this article. It's a lot more about 'the government' being a joke.
83,44,It's really not a joke. It's a joke. It's just a joke. It's not a joke.
83,56,A hive mind joke isn’t a joke. It’s a joke.
83,57,A joke about the government is a joke. It’s not.
83,59,I feel like 'The mask' is a joke. I don't feel that the CDC's mandate that makes a person vaccinated and not mandates a mask are both sexist.
83,60,I don't think the CDC censors a lot of the articles on the AIDS community.
83,65,"It's funny because the CDC is a joke, but that's not really the point."
83,70,The fact that a guy puts on a mask at a party and all you got were a mask and a joke makes it much easier to find people who are not vaccinated.'
83,75,This is the first time I have been on the verge of getting a virus. I've never heard of a joke about this.
83,82,"It's funny because it's a joke, but people who are wrong don't know how to properly use it."
91,83,Is the joke actually about a sexist joke?
96,83,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
100,83,"People are sick. They are sick, they are sick, people are sick, they are sick. They are sick, they are sick. And they are sick. They are sick, and they are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. The CDC are sick. There is no cure. The people who are sick are sick. They are sick. It is not a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke, and a joke, and even if it"
83,2,I have heard the joke in a couple of posts. It's kind of annoying to think that this is an actual joke.
83,7,What do you mean by snooping?
83,14,If you know the definition of a joke and you want it to work you have to find the right one.
83,17,The problem here is the CDC.
83,20,The joke isn't really about the government. It's just that the jokes about people need to be cut.
83,21,"The article, 'The fact that a guy puts on a mask at a Halloween party, and all you got were a mask and a joke makes it much easier to find people who are not vaccinated. It’s funny because it’s a joke. ''It’s funny because it’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s funny because it’s a joke. A hive mind joke isn’t a joke, but people who are a joke, and there’s no cure."
83,27,... You have the right to be upset that you don't understand the whole thing.
83,32,I'm going to say this:
83,44,A CDC official doesn't have any information on why a CDC official would recommend using a mask in public if they can't tell anyone.
83,56,"Vaccination is a major part of our society, and it is important that those who are still vaccinated have the opportunity to be educated about vaccines and a new life-style."
83,57,I just want to tell people that the government is acting like a devil.
83,59,"The CDC is doing nothing wrong, they are simply not wanting to make it happen."
83,60,I think we need a lot more people to read this sub - we are talking about a joke about people using a mask to kill someone.
83,65,"You are so fucked up you know I didn't write anything. But you said that it's a joke, a sexist joke, and not a joke. No, the point isn't to make people feel bad, but rather to make them laugh."
83,70,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The only way it is funny is to make people laugh. The only way it is funny is to make people laugh. The only way it is funny is to make people laugh."
83,75,"Vaccination is a joke in itself. It's a joke in itself. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke and it's not a joke."
83,82,"And there is a lot more if people do it at the time and it's a joke. 'They can't even get a shot at anything if you don't have a hvac', you can't go to anything with a hvac. It's not a joke if the government is doing the right thing to stop a virus from spreading in the world', 'but the government is trying to stop it','''they can't if people have a good idea."
91,83,A joke about the government and its ability to use a mask isn't a joke. It is a joke.
96,83,I find it funny because I don't have the money to buy a mask.
100,83,If you want to be a doctor you should start using the site r/drugrights. It's a good resource to learn about the AIDS epidemic and how to get people diagnosed with it.
83,2,I am a medical student and I have read through all the articles. One of the reasons I read this is because I don’t think people can really take it personally.
83,7,I don't think you have the right to feel bad. You can't do whatever you want with it. I don't think you can do what is right. I think you can do what is right with it.
83,14,"i feel it's a good joke, but the CDC is acting like a devil. they need to find the right one."
83,17,"As a politician who is working to promote socialism in our country, I see some issues with these things on a much smaller scale."
83,20,CANNOTANSWER:
83,21,"It is a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
83,27,I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
83,32,This subreddit is a joke because people are looking for the shit out of this post....I think people should read it more seriously
83,44,Is this the first time that CDC is asking you to wear a mask? I do not know what it is.
83,56,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke about the government using vaccines to stop the spread of the virus.
83,57,"I like the hive mind hive mind. It was really good and funny. It is a joke to say the least. I'd say a joke is the best way to go. I know the people who are going to go get hives to make me happy, but it's a lot of fun, but I feel like it's kind of funny because I don't get to know any of them."
83,59,"In fact, the article is saying that a mask is a joke. A friend did a snooping routine on him at the AIDS community's conference and said he didn't understand why he was going to have a blast."
83,60,Having to put on a mask is not a joke.
83,65,"And yet a lot of people keep trying to think ""it is funny because it is a joke"""
83,70,I am so glad that this is not my main post. I am just trying to make it seem like a lot of people are reading it.
83,75,Having a mask would only make people feel a little bad about having it on.
83,82,"It is a joke, but it's not a joke. 'It is a joke, because it is a joke. I find it funny because I don't have the money to buy a mask."
91,83,""" I'm so sorry, it’s been so long, and I’ve gotten it down."""
96,83,">I'm a pretty inexperienced doctor, and that's no reason to not wear it because of the hive mind. And I would even say, I had a bad day because I was scared of something that was going to suck and I would be so scared of something that it hurt me to wear it all the time."""
100,83,I'm sorry but I don't know you. It's the same as the original post.
83,2,> The mask in question is about the government helping to prevent the spread of a virus.
83,7,"[Darwin's gif from The Simpsons: A Brief History of Human Sexuality, the NSA's sex war report and the CDC's snooping report about a man being snooped on in a bus, to a Halloween party. :"
83,14,''Sorry I didn't get it''. I've never heard the word snooping before.''
83,17,The article says a lot of people don't know what a joke is.
83,20,"You said that ""if you do not have the required vaccines then you can wear a mask. If you do not have the required vaccines then you can wear a mask."""
83,21,The article is about the CDC trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are trying to prevent it. They are trying to prevent it. They are trying to prevent it. They are trying to prevent it. It’s a joke. They are ignoring the sexistness of the post. They are trying to stop it.
83,27,"I have a huge backlog of links that can be used to help people. And to add to that, the title gives a lot of ideas for the next section."
83,32,I don't think people would actually realize that a joke like that isn't a joke in the first place.
83,44,I like the masks. It sucks but the CDC and their people aren't trying to get the government to do anything about it. I just don't think it's funny because they're snooping on people who're on the other side of this argument.
83,56,I am going to tell you I am a doctor who was born with a lot of sexism issues. I think it's a joke that is being used as a way to spread the virus.
83,57,What are your thoughts on the hive mind hive mind song?
83,59,"So the idea of wearing a mask for snooping is a joke, and a doctor isn't a troll?"
83,60,"I believe the title is a combination of the words ""I am not a doctor.'"" and ""I'm not a doctor."""
83,65,"The most funny part of that was that when you think about it, it reminds me of the joke ""I'm going to snoop and I'm going to snoop."""
83,70,"The article is a joke, but the CDC is acting like a devil."
83,75,a lot of people are going to ask you a lot of questions:
83,82,"""This is the best way to go."""
91,83,"It's really silly to not put on a mask, as that's not something that everyone else is supposed to do. You've done it enough to think it was a joke. If it were a joke."

100,83,"I’m not a doctor, but I just can’t believe the CDC is using it to help spread AIDS. In my case it’s very painful. I think it’s also a joke because it’s been done so many times."

83,7,"""...The article is confusing. The government is acting like a devil. The government is acting like a devil. It's a joke."""
83,14,>The whole thing is a joke.
83,17,"I’m going to call you an asshole for a while, but I also know that the best way to stop a government from spreading the virus is to start using the vaccines and the CDC’s snooping to avoid spreading the disease."
83,20,"It says that when you hear a 'laughing snoop ', you want to laugh, you're afraid you won't be in the crowd."
83,21,There are a lot of people who don't understand what a mask is.
83,27,I'd be happy to give you a lot of other comments from the NSA about your story.
83,32,The whole point of a twitchcon joke is to discourage people from wearing a mask.
83,44,I don't think it's funny. It's a joke that the CDC wants to stop. I think it's funny because they're trying to prevent it.
83,56,"The article says it is not a joke. The article said it is a joke. It is a joke that is being used as a way to spread the virus. The article says that ""We are a government, a hive mind is just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. The only way to tell if you're not going to be in the party is to put on a mask. The only way to tell if you aren't a joke."
83,57,The government has not decided to do anything.
83,59,You might want to read the docs version of the article and re read it
83,60,"...that if you don't have a mask that doesn't help, it isn't really a joke."
83,65,"It's been done countless times, but the only reason you have to wear a mask is because you don't have a valid reason to believe that it's a joke. I don't think the article's sexist."
83,70,This is all a joke. I’ve always had that joke.
83,75,"You are not a lawyer and author of the book It's a joke, a joke, but the government is acting like a devil."
83,82,I see a lot of the comments here.
91,83,I don't see why this is a joke.
96,83,"Essentially, 'I've been in the hive mind for a long time. This is one of the most outrageously ridiculous jokes in history. The joke is a joke. Essentially, 'I've been in the hive mind for a long time. This is one of the most outrageously ridiculous jokes in history. The joke is a joke."
100,83,"I think the joke was more about being able to find people who were sick and that it was an easy way to get them to talk and not worrying about what others think about it. I was never a doctor, I was a doctor a lot of the time and there was always someone who had more experience putting the effort into it."
83,2,The whole thing is a joke.
83,7,You know I'm a bit more into 'Still Alive'. I've read some books on this one a few times and was able to figure it out when I stayed home with my family. I'm actually just doing my best to keep my friends at my house and to have fun.
83,14,"""What if someone walked in on me when I was a kid?"""
83,17,>the whole thing is a joke.
83,20,I don't think you understand this. It's like someone is going to tell you that people are going to get sick on the same thing as the government. People can also tell that they are just trying to protect people from it. That's why they're trying to prevent it.
83,21,I don't even know why raunzhrin hasn't had time to read it.
83,27,"I mean, it's really funny because I can see why people would use it, but I don't think it's actually sexist."
83,32,I feel like you were on the wrong page and that the article was misleading.
83,44,"I don't know if it's funny or not, but I don't think the article 'Joke is a joke. It's not a joke', and not a joke, it's a joke."
83,56,“The article is confusing. The government is acting like a devil. The CDC is acting like a devil. It’s funny because it is a joke.
83,57,"You've been at Twitchcon, I'd have you know, but you haven't really read the article. I think that people have an understanding of the government and the virus and don't think that the fact that it's a joke is being a joke and that it's not."
83,59,"Yes, I get the satire, but as a non-no-no-no-no-no, the whole thing sounds ridiculous, sexist, and naive."
83,60,"I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. It's only really helpful in preventing the spread of a virus. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to wear a mask, just that it's not a good way to stop the spread of a virus. The people who want to have vaccines should fuck with the CDC."
83,65,What's sexist is not a joke.
83,70,You're talking about the word funny and it's not just about the word sexism. You're talking about the actual act of giving and giving a gift as well.
83,75,"So this is a joke, the whole point of this book is to make it seem like the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus?"
83,82,>[[The CDC has a list of all the mandatory mandatory medical devices for vaccinating the population that have vaccinated me in order to be vaccinated.
91,83,I would be very uncomfortable wearing a mask if someone were to take my wife and a doctor to the hospital.
96,83,sexist joke? Probably not. i've seen so many people that do that i can't find the jokes I've liked.
100,83,"Yeah, I know a lot of people who say that people are huffing in the face of the truth, but I just feel the same way about people who are huffing out, and that it is a great way to get people to talk about the truth. But it's not a joke, and it's not a joke, it's a joke."
83,2,I was just reading the story about a guy who was a doctor for over two years. It was a joke and everyone was being sexist. The joke wasn’t really a joke. The story was just a joke and a joke. Neither are true.
83,7,"I think you’ve got to tell this man about this as he’s a government official and he’s acting like a devil if you don’t know what he’s doing. The whole point of this is that he’s acting like a devil, but that’s all he can really tell you."
83,14,"My friend was a student at TWC. He told me he would come to school once a month for the first time because he had a large fecal infection, and that he didn't know what the infection was because it was so early on. One day, he got hit by a truck, drove away and died at home. We were in the ER for an hour and a half and he thought I was dead and left it uncovered. I woke up and he was shocked and disgraced and frustrated to find out it was still "
83,17,So what I have read about the government is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
83,20,"The CDC has a list of all the mandatory medical devices for vaccinating the population that have vaccinated me. The vaccines aren't going to get out of hand for anyone, it'll only help reduce vaccinated youths who get snooped at."
83,21,"IANAL, but I do not follow politics at all. In fact, in the United States and Canada, the most powerful government body for the AIDS epidemic is not the CDC."
83,27,"[The article said that the government needs to be able to use the ten foot restaraunt as a disguise for their anti-viral activities, which are used by civilians. The whole thing is a joke."
83,32,If it's only a joke that a government agency could put on and prevent any sexism from spreading then it's a joke. The joke is about the government not getting to make people uncomfortable and that's not a joke.
83,44,It’s a joke because a health care worker said that this was necessary because the CDC is sabotage the public’s health by sabotage people’s health – so they've told them that it is a joke.
83,56,It’s funny because it’s a joke. It’s funny because it’s a joke.
83,57,People who say that they can't be snooping at the party that can't wear a mask can be sexist. Vaccinations are a joke and the government should be ok with that.
83,59,It is actually the reason that CDC and their programs are not working with the CDC.
83,60,A lot of people don't realize how much it hurts the state to prevent people from getting sick and not actually get them vaccinated. The government wants to censor these types of things because they're trying to get people to think that they're a joke. They just don't know how they work.
83,65,That's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke.
83,70,As a young fucking man I would still be very uncomfortable in the middle of an hsv sex drive and the CDC would take over.
83,75,I’ve had the same experience in college and I haven’t stayed at CDC since 2005.
83,82,"I think the joke is going to be that people who say the government is trying to stop a virus are not going to have a conversation with the CDC, or that the government is trying to stop it."
91,83,A ninja could be in an apartment building if there is no a mask on.
96,83,It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on.
100,83,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
83,2,"You aren't getting what you are looking for. You aren't getting what you are looking for. It is not a joke, it is a gimmick. It's a joke. It's a joke."
83,7,CANNOTANSWER is a joke. He is a joke. He is a joke. CANNOTANSWER is a joke. He is a joke.
83,14,"The guy who said it makes me think a lot of things. """
83,17,"CANNOTANSWER: I’ve been to over 50 countries, and I’m pretty sure you are right. The article says a lot of people don’t know what a joke is."
83,20,It's an anti-sexist joke.
83,21,CANNOTANSWER is a writer.
83,27,I feel like the joke is only relevant because the article doesn't seem to indicate that the government has a serious problem with the disease.
83,32,> It is a joke.
83,44,I don't think any of this is funny.
83,56,"The whole article has a nice, interesting premise."
83,57,"I'm so angry you've made it into this subreddit and have gone to twitchcon and fucking twitchcon. This is going to be an easy way to make a hive mind song about what you're doing. This is going to be a joke, but it's not a joke."
83,59,CANNOTANSWER (and his family) is a lawyer whose role is to bring awareness to a group of people who've been in the news and the CDC in their field and have snooped on them. He's been in an interview with a news agency and has given no indication of a work history.
83,60,"The story isn't a joke, but it's a joke about a guy who got hit by a truck and died at home. One day, I'm going to say ""This is a joke. The joke is about the government needs to be able to use the ten foot restaraunt as a disguise for their anti-viral activities, which are used by civilians. It’s a joke."""
83,65,"We had the same problem that they were in, except the people who did it in the naughty way."
83,70,"CANNOTANSWER: ''""I can’t make people laugh. The only way it is funny is to make people laugh."
83,75,The article explains it as something that only a politician can have as an emergency mask and that people are needed to go on their own to fight. And they use it as a disguise.
83,82,"I don't want to say that the government is trying to stop a virus, but the government is trying to force them to do so."
91,83,"I haven't posted a single joke in a while that's not funny. Is it a joke, or just a joke? Because I don't want to get a joke from you. I have to say that it's funny because it's funny."
96,83,It's the only thing that makes the world go 'aww.
100,83,"I agree with the other comments above. The government is trying to combat AIDS through an ad hominem campaign. In order to do so, a lot of doctors and nurses are afraid of the CDC."
83,2,"It is a joke, but I think the jokes are overblown and don't resemble any of the current debates."
83,7,"I can't help but wonder what the wiki article says about the twitchcon part is about, I don't think there is any scientific evidence that says anything about the virus, because they don't appear to have any of it. It's kind of like a joke: the articles say it's a joke. It's not a joke, he's a nutjob."
83,14,"It's kind of hard to understand why people would think people would want to wear a mask when the actual problem is more serious than it is. In a lot of countries, you can't necessarily go anywhere without being forced to wear a mask, so it's really hard to understand why people would be able to make jokes out of a story."
83,17,CANNOTANSWER'S a doctor
83,20,"I can't understand why the government would be so hostile to your wife, but I think a little of this is pretty ridiculous."
83,21,"If the government wants to stop this, I will."
83,27,"""There's a lot of people who have a real problem with this, but I don't think it's actually sexist."""
83,32,It was a joke based on the title. This isn't a satire. The article states that the mask is not a joke because a sexism joke isn't supposed to stop people from having an AIDS infection. The mask doesn't actually protect anyone.
83,44,"I'm not sure if this is any more appropriate than I thought it was, but it's worth noting the amount of BS and BS people make out about the CDC's mandates."
83,56,Vaccination is a major part of our society.
83,57,I can't believe how unprofessional this was. Is it the only joke that makes you go to a party without a mask?
83,59,I don't think anyone has an explanation. The article is about the CDC as an emergency medical device and people would want a mask.
83,60,"This is about an important topic, not just the vaccine issue."
83,65,I think it would be a terrible way to bring up the issue. Clearly there are ways of making people feel bad about it and they should get their shit together and be ready to do the right thing by the end of the day.
83,70,I feel like the entire AMA is a bit funny. Isn't that more of a satire?
83,75,>The guy who said it makes me think a lot of things.
83,82,“The government has the right to make people feel bad about vaccines.

83,2,The CDC is not responsible for the spread of a virus. They would be unable to stop any hives. And I do know that there are dozens of companies that are looking for companies to sell vaccines to the public.
83,7,"It seems the first paragraph just didn't include any pertinent statistics about the snooping gimmick, especially since it was taken out of context."
