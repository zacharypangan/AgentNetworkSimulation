    "AIDS is not a joke.",
    "You\u2019re going to have to go through this book to see how well it explains why there\u2019s no such thing as a 'joke' that you would be able to explain, right?",
    "People are sick. They are sick, they are sick, people are sick, they are sick. They are sick, they are sick. And they are sick. They are sick, and they are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. They are sick. The CDC are sick. There is no cure. The people who are sick are sick. They are sick. It is not a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke, and a joke, and even if it",
    "If you want to be a doctor you should start using the site r/drugrights. It's a good resource to learn about the AIDS epidemic and how to get people diagnosed with it.",
    "I'm sorry but I don't know you. It's the same as the original post.",
    "I\u2019m not a doctor, but I just can\u2019t believe the CDC is using it to help spread AIDS. In my case it\u2019s very painful. I think it\u2019s also a joke because it\u2019s been done so many times.",
    "I think the joke was more about being able to find people who were sick and that it was an easy way to get them to talk and not worrying about what others think about it. I was never a doctor, I was a doctor a lot of the time and there was always someone who had more experience putting the effort into it.",
    "Yeah, I know a lot of people who say that people are huffing in the face of the truth, but I just feel the same way about people who are huffing out, and that it is a great way to get people to talk about the truth. But it's not a joke, and it's not a joke, it's a joke.",
    "It's a joke. It's not a joke.",
    "I agree with the other comments above. The government is trying to combat AIDS through an ad hominem campaign. In order to do so, a lot of doctors and nurses are afraid of the CDC.",
    "AIDS is a problem and a joke, it\u2019s not funny and it\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s a joke, and it\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s a joke because of a real problem.",
    "A \"Right\" (as in \"Don't you think I like a clone of a clone of a clone of a clone if you're a doctor). A \"I've got the clone and the clone and the clone, and the clone is on me. Is that the clone clone?\"? That is actually a very good line. A lot of people are aware of this and use it as a joke.",
    "This is just a joke. It's not a joke.",
    "... I think this is the joke for the sake of the joke ",
    "I think we've heard a lot of a joke here."
