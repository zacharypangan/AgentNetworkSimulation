82,66,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
85,66,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
91,66,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
92,66,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
66,20,Well that's just plain stupid.
66,22,This isn't an opinion. It's a policy.
66,30,You mean you have to put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then take it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things I lose a mask at least four times a day.

66,65,"I would say Trump is a stupid, insecure, and obnoxious, and I am sure this is a scam."
82,66,"No, I hate when people wear masks in public and it's a pretty common misconception."
85,66,"I've been doing that for 4 years now. Besides, if I had been wearing a mask, I'd probably be a little sick of it. I'm probably not so much a sick person, but I could be a sick person, at least in my opinion."
91,66,This is why we all wear masks. There are different kinds of masks.
92,66,"I had a job with a ten foot stretcher, so I got a good job in the first place. I had a friend who had a long sleeved vest at the time so she wouldn't look down and look at me like I had to stand next to him and go to work."
66,20,I think that this policy will be used by a very good majority of people.

66,47,"People on this sub have been talking about the fact that when they look at Trump's address it is, but for what it's worth, the real question is why does he like wearing a mask?"
66,53,"I like the idea of ""I know, you're not sick"", but I like the idea of ""I don't think I'll ever feel sick by a mask."""
66,57,"I agree with you completely. In order to stop an infection, the government must remove the protection that it provides. The mask, then, has to be removed. In order to restrict the spread of an infection, the government must remove the protections that it provides to prevent the spread of it."
66,60,"It's pretty common for people to wear masks, but not for the government."
66,65,"I don't even think the 'insecure' thing would work. I mean, the truth, I think the 'insecure' thing is more common than that."
82,66,"It's a common misconception. There's a reason it's illegal in Australia and we don't have a CDC list, but it's pretty common."
85,66,I lost a mask because my dad died.
91,66,I don't think there is any single other example of the actual point of wearing a mask
92,66,I think I lost my mask in that first episode. I felt terrible. Then I felt like I lost my wallet. I was scared and just realized I lost it!
66,20,"I mean, I do wear them a lot. But in an emergency, my body is literally in the middle of a swat. I can't even see any of it."
66,22,I can't think of any reason why Trump has been so obnoxious if he said a lot about it in the first place.
66,30,"He's not a fool. If he were a fool, would he be a fucking moron?"
66,47,Probably because he wears masks for a lot of health reasons. Not sure why he is uncomfortable with them but it sounds like there's a lot of people who wear them to make a serious habit of it.
66,53,"Unless they want to protect you from it, I'd just let you go. I don't think she's the one that is going to take you out, but I'd be scared to get the hives out."
66,57,"if you have to wear a mask, it will restrict your right to live. The only way to prevent that is by making it more likely that you can die."
66,60,"They say that it's ok for people to wear masks in public and that it's a very common misconception, and that he's going to change it, because in the end, it's not going to work in the future."
66,65,People here don't even have to wear a mask at all. They should have a hooded mask and a hooded one. They need a big hooded mask.
82,66,"""I hate when people wear masks in public and it's a pretty common misconception."""
85,66,"I want to tell you this is true because I've been wearing a mask for 4 years now and I had no idea how to use it. I didn't have to replace it EVER, but I've used one once or twice and I still need a new one."
91,66,I like to wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet
92,66,"Honestly, if you can't afford it, you'd be a scam if you don't have the money. I'm sure they would do the same shit for me. I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life. I don't think anyone said it would be a scam for me if I had the money. I'm sure they would do the same shit for me."
66,20,"hes a scumbag if hes a scumbag, if you need a mask thats gonna be one of the dumbest things you can ever do."
66,22,"Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
66,30,"Because the US has a lot of ""dicks"". That's the truth."
66,47,Is he wearing a mask a sign of insecurity? Does the guy have a r/science sub to help them out?
66,53,"> I like the idea of ""I know, you're not sick"", but I like the idea of ""I don't think I'll ever feel sick by a mask."""
66,57,This is exactly what's happening: they are stooping into it and are going to make money by selling more products.
66,60,"I'm not saying it's ok, but it does sound like it's a common misconception. I think that the 'Insecure' thing is something people should wear in public, but a lot of people are so scared to use them that they just don't know how to use them."
66,65,It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system. It's because there's so little public space to do things that aren't very useful.
82,66,"There is a reason that it's illegal in Australia and we don't have a CDC list, but it's pretty common."
85,66,"As someone who was caught in the past with a mask, it seems like a weird idea."
91,66,> This is why we all wear masks.
92,66,"[Certified person](http://www.cbr.org/cbr-us/hr/hr-info.html) based on a video and it was published in 2010 by The CDC. They used ""fake masks"" to get them to wear out on a daily basis. You can find some of them on Amazon. They are usually good for those who can pay the cost, but sometimes they are just not worth it."
66,20,> I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life.
66,22,You could buy a mask in the '80s. It's on Amazon (where I live) and it costs a ton.
66,30,"I hate when people wear masks in public, because they're a common misconception."
66,47,"""What's your idea of wearing a mask?"""
66,53,"It was a bit trite that they would do something similar. It's actually not a real idea, but a common misconception."
66,57,"This is what it's about, not the mask. It's about the mask, not the mask. It's a part of the government's job to help prevent the spread of infection. I'm not saying he has a right to protect people or the people in his office, but what he is saying is absolutely wrong and if you want to change that you must get one of these and use it."
66,60,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Unless they want to protect you from it, I'd just let you go.

The only way to prevent that is by making it more likely that you can die."
66,65,"In my experience, this is probably the most common way to describe the CDC."
82,66,I haven't seen a single example of a virus that was actually spread in the US or Europe.
85,66,"I'm sick, not sick. You have a mask."
91,66,I have never thought about wearing a mask while I was a youth. My parents aren't doing this. They have a friend who's going to be homeless and is putting on a mask. That's how I feel about my husband's behavior.
92,66,I think I read your post as a joke. I'm gonna go back and post this as a joke. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
66,20,"My dad had a mask that was worn a lot while he was pregnant and got a lot of hives, and it's one of the best things I've ever done in my entire life, even if it didn't really cause my husband any trouble. I was a very sensitive guy and he'd ask me to stop and make sure it wasn't a syphilis-esque thing. I don't think he's a very nice person. He's just trying to get me on it and keep on going."
66,22,"In my experience, this is probably the most common way to describe the CDC."
66,30,"He's not a fool, he's a big nerd. He is a real racist. I have never heard of him."
66,47,"I don't think I've ever seen a real example of this, but I would never be able to wear one of those. This guy - especially if he's not going to change his attitude about it - doesn't seem genuinely interested in getting caught, so he's kind of doing it by himself. Besides, that makes him seem a little insecure."
66,53,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,57,"Yes, I agree with your first statement, but I agree with him on that one. It's not really a joke."
66,60,"If a mask is not an option, then it should be."
66,65,"I'm not sure if you would want to hear the CDC's article, but I wouldn't consider it a big deal."
82,66,"I hate the part that people think this is the right way to put it. I mean, the thing with masks is that it protects you from the disease. It doesn't actually scare you into thinking that it's a symptom of it, just that it's more prevalent than anything else. The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam. It's not a scam. It's not a scam. I'm sorry, but I'm just scared of being"
85,66,"Well, he didn't really say it was a prank, he said it was a joke. But I'm glad it worked for him."

92,66,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam.
66,20,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
66,22,"There are many types of infections. Many of them are caused by the virus, but don't really take into account that that isn't the actual situation in which the virus is spread and can't be controlled by government. For example, if a family member got a disease that they were unaware of, they'd have no idea. A lot of people in their early 20s (and early 20s) had symptoms of the virus."
66,30,">The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam. It's not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam."
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,53,"The only way to stop a sick person from dying is to have it taken out, preferably from your family. That's not a joke."
66,57,"It's a scam. I'm not saying he has a right to protect people or the people in his office, but what he's saying is absolutely wrong. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not."
66,60,I like the idea that a CDC member has to wear a mask when they get sick to stay home and that the CDC's role in protecting you is to protect you if you're sick and sick. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
66,65,I'm very sorry to say this. I would also like to point out that the government is essentially trying to make a joke that the president isn't doing it.
82,66,I think he is a scumbag if he's wrong.
85,66,"He might be a narcissist, but if you have been a narcissist, you're a doctor. If you are an infected doctor, you're a doctor."
91,66,They said it was an illegal way to keep people alive if they were exposing them to HIV/AIDS. It's not an easy thing to do.
92,66,You're not talking about a scam. It's about a a scam.
66,20,This is what happens when you wear a mask - the government and the public.
66,22,I think the article is misleading and misleading.
66,30,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
66,47,>A lot of people in their early 20s (and early 20s) had symptoms of the virus. I think he is a scumbag if he's wrong.
66,53,"In a nutshell, the CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people - from people infected with HIV/AIDS (infected by a virus that is more prevalent than HIV/AIDS)."
66,57,Why did you want to hear this?
66,60,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,65,"""It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system."""
82,66,"I don't think this is a scam, just that the trick is to convince people to get vaccinated with a tarot card - it's the best way to get them to put a mask on."
85,66,"> I just lost my face because I wore a mask for work,"
91,66,Is there a wikipedia page about this?
92,66,CDC has a serious problem with scams and does nothing with the proper procedures to stop the spread of viruses. They need to make the masks available for the general public to purchase and do the research.
66,20,So you want to see the CDC putting on a mask to protect you?
66,22,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,30,I think this is more of a rumor than a truth. Vaccination is not a scam.
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government. Vaccination is not a scam.
66,53,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,57,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
66,60,I was actually able to see the mask because I had been a doctor for three months and was infected with the virus. Now it's a really big deal to wear one.
66,65,They do not have a 'good health system'.
82,66,"I think the people who don't have the CDC are making their money, not the CDC."
85,66,"What’s weird is that this guy said this to his friends, it was a joke, a prank, a joke, a joke, a joke. They said this because I was sick and can’t help it. It was a joke, and I think it’s a little weird."
91,66,"I believe the fact that they are trying to bring attention to the issue is sexist, because if he isn't a huge fan of the idea of a mask, he isn't a fan of the idea of a mask."
92,66,I have read this whole thing from many sources and have always wondered why it took so long for them to make it through to the top.
66,20,"Yes, it's a smear campaign. If I want to see this, I just have to give it a shot. I don't think it's as big of a deal as we think."
66,22,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In a nutshell, the CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people - from people infected with HIV/AIDS (infected by a virus that is more prevalent than HIV/AIDS)."
66,30,No he's not. It is a scam.
66,47,"Trump said that in the first presidential address. If he didn't want to get vaccinated, that's a prank."
66,53,He's got a mask to protect his face from the hives and then the CDC gets on board.
66,57,Vaccination is a scam. It's the government.
66,60,This seems like a pretty simple joke.
66,65,And here are the parts that get interesting: Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
82,66,"They don't really do a proper tarot card or a tarot card card. If they do do a full tarot card, a tarot card can prevent you from getting a TB/TB virus."
85,66,The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind.
91,66,"I'm sorry, but I've been wearing a mask for more than 2 years now."
92,66,"This is a serious, widespread scam."
66,20,"I was in the CDC's office for about a year, and I found out I had been on a vaccine to stop an outbreak, and the CDC wasn't getting along with it. I thought I was a real scumbag because I had never gotten the flu yet."
66,22,">Wearing a mask, and ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them. I would say Trump is a stupid, insecure, and obnoxious, and I am sure this is a scam."""
66,30,"I think that's what is in this article. It's kind of a joke, but if you're able to see it, you have to do it."
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,53,It's a prank.
66,57,"The government, not the government itself, is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system. It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's the government."
66,60,"I'm not sure if you know anything about tarot, but it's a common misconception in the tarot world to use the term ""smear campaign."""
66,65,"We have a lot of people trying to bring attention to the issue and if there is a problem that we need to address, we need to work on it. We have a lot of people trying to get the attention of the people that are making us uncomfortable because we aren't aware of the problem, but it seems that the problem is with the way we are using our social media and communication technology."
82,66,"I love it. I wore my tarot card at one of my meetings for 2 months last week and it didn't take off, I threw up because I just had to get the card done."
85,66,*The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind.*
91,66,So... What's this guy saying about putting on a mask?
92,66,"This is a serious, widespread scam."
66,20,He's basically just being nice.
66,22,I'm not sure whether the CDC or in America are aware of this. But I'm not sure if they've heard of the government and are being made aware of it and how they are using it in ways that would have been obvious to you.
66,30,Why do you think this is a scam?
66,47,It's a joke.
66,53,"The only way to stop a sick person from dying is to have it taken out, preferably from your family. That's not a joke."
66,57,"Vaccination is a scam. They do a full tarot card, a tarot card can prevent you from getting a TB/TB virus. The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind. I'm sorry, but I've been wearing a mask for more than 2 years now. This seems like a pretty simple joke. And here are the parts that get interesting: Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam."
66,60,This isn't a scam. It's a scam.
66,65,"It's been an issue for a while, but I do think this is going to have a place in the headlines where the government is the one trying to 'task' questions about vaccines. This may be a joke, but I think it is a bit of a dumb one that he said, but it's a funny one."
82,66,TIL that there's a CDC list because of this.
85,66,I think it's a joke in a weird way. It's a prank because of how many people are affected by it and that they're scared of something.
91,66,"""Hiro Jimi"", 'My wife and I are really into it. They've been together 2 years."""
92,66,"It's just a scam because you just told me that because it's a scam the CDC needs to be able to put up a ""no problem"" list for those that are still interested in trying a vaccine."
66,20,No! You don't know the truth about tarot cards. You just don't understand what a tarot card can tell you.
66,22,"This is very similar to the CDC saying ""Way to prevent someone from dying"" - but it's a prank because someone is trying to trick them into a vaccine and they're trying to pretend a mask is the reason for it. It's a scam because it's a prank because they're trying to make it less funny."
66,30,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system.
66,47,">The government, not the government itself, is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system."
66,53,I had to make a mask because it was hard for me to buy it. I thought it would make a prank if I was not wearing it.
66,57,"He's trying to make some kind of'smear campaign' that isn't actually true, but makes some kind of 'fun' way out of being a tarot card."
66,60,So the CDC was a bad decision and the government is a bad decision? It's a prank to do.
66,65,It was a joke because the CDC did not want to have a list for the medical use and that the CDC had to tell them it was a scam. So this is a joke.
82,66,> I've been to a party with a tarot card and I don't think they want to cover it up.
85,66,"I have a pretty good fear of flying flies, but I am a big fan of wearing them in my family and they seem to genuinely have a good understanding of why they're around. I'm sure they have some phobias and they're not sure if you're in an hive mind, or if you're a person with a phobia. Then they threw up a story about it that's all a joke."
91,66,"It's not a joke. It's a fact. It's hard to explain why people think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do."
92,66,I lost my mask when I was a little kid to help prevent the spread of HIV a few years ago. I don't think it's a scam.
66,20,It's a scam to try to manipulate the people that are going to try to manipulate it.
66,22,"So, while I'm not sure what 'hive mind' means to anyone, I think a good chance that's actually true?"
66,30,... and it was a scam because it was not the right thing to do.
66,47,This is a scam because it's a good way to stop the spread of a virus.
66,53,"They're telling a story about this. If you've had a mask, you know you're in an hive mind."
66,57,I'm so sorry you are experiencing this. This is an issue that is affecting millions. I feel like I can get to the very end and then have to learn to read. I'm so sorry. But I don't have any idea where you are coming from.
66,60,a prank if they are going to cut the headlines.
66,65,Vaccination is a joke. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's going to cost a fortune in medical bills and is going to hurt the health system.
82,66,"It's all about how you do it, and how you put it on your face. Do it on your face. No one will ever be able to get in touch with you."
85,66,The jokes are a joke. But they aren't pranks.
91,66,I'm going to say: It's not a joke. It's a fact. I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. It's a joke.
92,66,The CDC needs to put up a no problem list for those interested in trying a vaccine.
66,20,He has to wear a mask for a reason. That's not what he's trying to do.
66,22,That's what the CDC is trying to do.
66,30,"I think the entire point of the article is to point out that people don't have a legitimate opinion and don't even know if they have a 'hive mind'. They don't even know what a mask is, because they are only there for the medical use and not to fuck with."
66,47,"I think people on this sub have been talking about the fact that when they look at Trump's address it is, but for what it's worth, the real question is why does he like wearing a mask?"
66,53,Vaccination is a scam.
66,57,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,60,What's a prank if the government is a prank to do?
66,65,I don't want to mention that Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam because it's not as effective as a normal hooded hooded mask.
82,66,They are fucking scams.
85,66,I'm so glad the CDC didn't think it was a prank.
91,66,"It's not a joke, but a fact. It's an example of how people don't actually want to do the right thing and they don't realize what it means. I mean, what I was putting on was very stupid. I'm not saying I was dumb or uncomfortable. But it sounds like it's a joke."
92,66,"I have a lot of friends who are interested in preventing AIDS, but they have nothing to do with it. I'd be willing to sell some to them."
66,20,"The CDC and the public are not working together to provide this vaccine, but it was a prank. They do it for health care, and the CDC wants to provide a shitload of money for the health care. So they just want to make the vaccine more affordable."
66,22,Vaccination is a prank. It is a scam.
66,30,It's not a joke. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,47,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government.
66,53,I don't see why it wouldn't be a prank for the people on this sub.
66,57,"I'm so sorry, but I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."
66,60,"Is there a way to make this as a joke? If it doesn't, why not just have someone get a tarot and put the word ""smear campaign"" into it?"
66,65,I think you should also mention the whole point of Vaccination.
82,66,This is a tarot card for a lot of reasons.
85,66,"The problem here is that a bunch of people are trying to push a joke on people who aren't actually sick. But that's just me, not the CDC."
91,66,i'm really into this.
92,66,"You're saying that this isn't really a scam. There is no evidence for it, and a lot of things have been said in the past."
66,20,I like the tarot cards but I think the point is that they aren't really a joke but that it's a prank. They don't make you a prank and the fact that it's a prank doesn't make it a joke.
66,22,"I've always heard that this is not a scam, a prank. But a prank. A prank that I've not heard of before."
66,30,Because it would hurt the public. It would not be the right thing to do.
66,47,"So when someone is saying something like this, and someone is making an attempt at doing it, it's a prank?"
66,53,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. What's a prank if the government is a prank to do?
66,57,"As long as you know what the mask is, there's a chance that it's still a prank, especially if he does it on the public."
66,60,"I have a lot of friends who are interested in preventing AIDS, but they have nothing to do with it. I'm so sorry, but I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."

82,66,Is a tarot card a scam? I thought it was a scam.
85,66,It’s just a joke based on how people think that people with phobias have the potential to get sick from the effects of viruses. It’s not a joke.
91,66,Having the facts and humour of a real world story.
92,66,"This is all a scam if you're trying to make it clear that a mask isn't real. This is an actual scam, and it's not. This is a legitimate way for the CDC to scam people into buying and buying vaccines. The whole thing is a scam. The only problem is that this isn't a scam. If it's a scam, then it's definitely not a scam. The CDC should be able to put up a list for the patients that can't afford the vaccine. :("
66,20,A lot of this is just a prank.
66,22,What I'm trying to say is that there's no point in putting a mask on a person that hasn't heard of it - but they want to help the people that can't afford it - unless a real human being goes to visit them.
66,30,"And I agree, I want the guy to take action if I are to protect people who might or might not be able to get vaccines. I am sure that the fact that he's just saying this as a joke doesn't change his view on this stuff."
66,47,"It's not a prank. It's a scam because it's a scam because it's a scam. If you know what the mask is, then you're at the bottom of the tarot deck."
66,53,It's a prank. Vaccination isn't a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,57,"That's a really interesting read. You have to think about this: ""This is a lot of things that have been said in the past. I'm really into this. You're saying that this isn't really a scam. There is no evidence for it, and a lot of things have been said in the past."
66,60,The problem isn't that it's a prank. They say that it's a scam. The government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This is a scam. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,65,The CDC has been doing a lot of things to try and make the public aware of the problem. They are trying to make a joke.
82,66,I think the CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards.
85,66,I think the point was that you should not take the blame on a CDC. It sounds like it's about how much the government is responsible for the spread of a virus.
91,66,"I don't think this subreddit is actually going to become very funny without some sort of real humour. I'd say that most of these are really good and maybe more useful than the above ones. It's a pretty long time to find out, but it sounds like I should be able to weed it out."
92,66,You have a lot of other stuff to talk about.
66,20,Ingraham was a scumbag. I don't think he is a prank.
66,22,"This is actually a good idea. What I am doing right now is a fake tarot card. It's a way of making a joke to help the public think about something in some manner, and I am not sure how they will deal with this scam, but it will help with a lot of other things."
66,30,"No, the CDC is trying to get people to have vaccines, but they’re trying to get people to have them because they don’t believe they have the disease. This isn’t a prank, it’s a joke."
66,47,The CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards.
66,53,"> The only way to stop a sick person from dying is to have it taken out, preferably from your family. That's not a joke."
66,57,"I've been wearing a mask for 2 years now. It's very unlikely I've ever heard of it - if you look a little more closely, it's unlikely you would ever notice that it's actually a joke."
66,60,Why don't you just go home and tell your wife and children?
66,65,It's a good idea that the CDC is trying to make the public aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They're trying to make the public aware that the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with it.
82,66,"As you know, if you wear a tarot card in the office and don't know who you are, you may be able to use it to get vaccinated or prevent you from getting raped. 'Tis a joke. The trick is to get the mask off to keep you from getting a virus.'"
85,66,"I think that the problem is that people think they have a phobia and that they can't be attracted to anyone, and that the government is being pushed to believe it's actually a joke."
91,66,I think it's going to get more of a laugh if people get a little snarky. But I also think there is a great chance that some people are thinking the same thing as you.
92,66,The CDC isn't a scam because they are trying to get people to get the vaccine. That's the point of any health care scam.
66,20,"I think the whole prank is a joke. They want to convince the public to get it, but it isn't."

66,53,Why are people in a hive mind when there are no hives left?
66,57,"Ingraham was trying to make the public aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, so he's trying to make them aware that he isn't a scam."
66,60,The CDC has a policy against the government wanting to change it.
66,65,I think it's a good idea to have a mask and not just be on the CDC site. They may not want to mention how serious it is and that's why people believe he's an asshole for trying to make a prank that is supposed to be joke. The CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards.
82,66,"No, that's not a scam, because I was skeptical about a tarot card a few months ago. It's also one of the first tarot cards I've ever seen, and one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's a joke."
85,66,I lost my face because I wore a mask for work.
91,66,I think the only point I was making was that you need to take it to a different level.
92,66,It sounds like a fucking scam to me.
66,20,Its not a joke that people thought a tarot card was a joke and they're snarky and ignorant.

66,53,"I think it's a prank, but they're trying to make the public aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
66,57,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,60,The entire story he's telling is basically the truth:
66,65,"I think the real issue here is that people want to be seen as the worst people to ever see. I think it's a good idea to have a mask. The only way to stop a sick person from dying is to have it taken out, preferably from your family. That's not a joke. I think it's a good idea."
82,66,"I'm not sure why this was a joke. The way you phrased it - ""We have a very twisted anti-virus attitude of this sub. The tarot is a fraudulent tool, used to trick people. The trick is to sell it, or to take it off or make an item that they haven't used before, so there are no risk to the user. It's a fraud in itself, but isn't necessarily a fraud in the sense that it was intended."" is the other way around."
85,66,"Unless the CDC's response to it isn't like the CDC's. Besides, if you have a phobia you'll not have to wear a mask if you're not scared of the virus."
91,66,"A lot of people don't even know a bit about this. If you think that's funny, and don't know the real context, you are probably misunderstanding. But I don't think the point is that this subreddit has a better story."
92,66,"Yes, I know a good doctor. He will always be an expert, and there is no way to guarantee that the guy can afford to get this. However, he cannot be a fraud if he gets away with it because of the people they were contacted with. The point of a scam is to try to make the guy happy."
66,20,There are no good reasons to have a mask. The only thing that should be changed is to have the tarot card removed.
66,22,It's a prank. It's a scam.
66,30,"As a guy who used to suck my dick up and play tarot cards for the rest of my life, I have to say I had the most hate for this guy."
66,47,It's a scam because it's a scam.
66,53,Vaccination is a prank because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
66,57,"It sounds like the CDC is being sarcastic about how'same' as a fake tarot card. They tasp it up to get a mask that's actually on a website - they say it's a scam and so they're making money off of it, but its not a scam at all."
66,60,"I just want to point out that there is a ""scam"" of a joke that has no truth, so that I think it's a nice joke. I'm so sorry, but I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."

66,20,"I can't remember what's going on in your comment, but the CDC is trying to get the word out that the tarot card is a scam."

66,65,A mask and a mask make you a bit insecure and it’s a joke. The CDC is trying to promote a dangerous environment to deal with the virus.

66,20,I was asked if the CDC and public were working together to bring awareness of this as a prank and you said it was a joke. I thought it was a joke because the CDC wanted to stop the spread of the virus. So they wanted to provide a shitload of money for the health care.

66,47,Why isn't the CDC trying to promote a dangerous environment to deal with HIV/AIDS?

66,60,A couple of these things are really hard to explain:
66,65,">If Trump were a lawyer, would he be using the word joke?"
82,66,It doesn’t sound like it’s a scam.
85,66,They just want a story about what happened and they want to try to do it in a fun and funny way.
91,66,Is wearing a mask an example of how people don't actually want to do the right thing and they don't realize what it means?
92,66,"I'm sorry, but if I were to start with, the doctor who said I lost a mask would tell me that he lost it and I was actually a doctor and didn't understand the article."

85,66,I see why people in the comments make this a joke and I don't think it's necessary. A doctor and a doctor and a doctor are one and the same.

66,30,I'm surprised the amount of people in this thread who just don't understand that Trump's words were actually used to deter someone from getting the virus. I mean I'm referring to what the article has to say about that sarcasm.
66,47,"Why are the people who don't wear them saying ""They're going to try to do this on the street by themselves."" And not just be a scumbag?"

66,22,The only people in that article who haven't heard of the CDC are a couple. Is that why they didn't put a mask on them?
66,30,I think the whole point of the article is to point out that people don't have a legitimate opinion and don't even know if they have a 'hive mind'.
66,47,A lot of people have been sick and have never vaccinated.
66,53,"The fact that this is a joke is actually a joke, isn't the whole story"
