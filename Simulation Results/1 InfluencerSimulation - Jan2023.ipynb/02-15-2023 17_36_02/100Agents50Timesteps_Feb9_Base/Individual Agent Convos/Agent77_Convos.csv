77,14,"He's got a million different ideas about the human condition. I don't think he's right but if he was, that's a different issue. It's interesting to me that the US government has a lot more power than the rest of the world, and that is the reason they haven't brought it up to the public yet. They don't know enough about it to really have much influence, so he needs to be able to keep it in mind."

77,14,I’m glad you’re getting an example of someone who has to learn about the importance of wearing a mask. I’ve been wearing a mask for years and I’m glad I’m not the only one who figured out this.

77,14,"I think the biggest issue here is that ""what we are talking about in here is the government not letting us out, the whole idea of what's happening in the world."""
77,34,"If I'm the only one wearing it, the same thing happens in other parts of the world. It can be a little scary at times, but I think it's important to recognize it when we wear it and do it."
77,70,"The government has no incentive to rape people or to scare people into believing the government is raped. They only allow rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area. Rather they give them a false sense of security, and tell them the truth."

87,77,There is a bit of a fetish in the American media.
91,77,"They want to stop people from being exposed to it. So the fucking government is trying to make it worse than it was before. It’s just not an easy thing to do, and there are many ways to keep people alive."
93,77,Its a shame that the people who use it are going to continue to get sick from it. People who use it to stop the spread of a virus are the ones who essentially just eat things that aren't real. It is the same reason why people don't get sick from it. I've tried many types of masks and still find them to be awful and incredibly uncomfortable.
77,3,"I fucked up this narrator of yours. The person on my list has an article about this, and it sounds like it is the same person you think is the most sexist."

77,34,"The government wants to help, not protect."
77,70,>( I am so confused) what exactly is the NSA's mandate?
80,77,"I was reading this about a time ago where my mom would look at me in a mirror and tell me how horrible it was. The next day I told her he'd been a bad scumbag for having a fucking mask that was so unfunny! She would be a huge fucking scumbag! You scumbag, you'd get a fucking pigeon. I'd probably die, but she was a terrible scumbag."

77,3,As a gay man in my 20s and 40s I hate having to wear a mask on as it is a fetish that causes so much suffering and discomfort. It's a mask that has no purpose in its life.
77,13,"And then he goes on to say ""the rapist's secret is going to get his head in a ball."""
77,14,"...The government wants to help, not protect."
77,34,So I like to wear a mask because of what is happening to people in my neighborhood?
77,70,"I’d say there’s some rambling here. What is the purpose of the NSA mandate? The NSA’s mandate is not to prevent rape, but to prevent it from spreading and preventing a variety of diseases. There are a few things the NSA is doing about it, such as preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It isn’t about the NSA requiring it to stop because it ain’t a mandate. They are also a criminal organisation, which is why it's the one that the NSA wants to stop."
80,77,Obama is helping the US government stop the spread of AIDS and you can't just ignore it.
87,77,"If you've got the mask and a tarot card and a tarot card and the government is ok with it, and that's the first thing you'd do."
91,77,That's a lot of BS. The government should be doing it all to stop the spread of a virus.
93,77,Is it real tarot or do you just read the title?
77,3,"So, if we were given the opportunity to have a mask on for fun, that's the mask that should be on, like the white mask, not the mask that should be on? What about a real tarot card?"
77,13,i don't know what the NSA is doing. the government doesn't have any interest in trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
77,14,"Yes. But this doesn’t explain what the NSA’s mandate is. It’s the mandate to help prevent rape. This is what it’s supposed to help prevent. This is what people think about other things and how the NSA is working to stop the spread of AIDS, which is a big part of the story."

80,77,I'm not saying it's not a scam. I'm saying that the government should educate itself on the issue and try to educate themselves to the necessary level of safety.
87,77,"I'm just curious, as to what makes this a good thing?"
91,77,"It is illegal to put on a mask to stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS. It is illegal to use that word in public. People have no way to know that this is legal, but in reality it is illegal to put on a mask to help stop people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS."
93,77,"It is pretty much what it says. If you go to a scary movie, and there are no more movies, you can still watch them. If you go to a good movie, just take it off."
77,3,I'm going to go over this a couple of times today to find a good quote based on a random article about a piece of real tarot. It's about the fact that you're a very specific person and have different opinions about the person you're talking about.
77,13,"It's the only way to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC has called on everyone to stop wearing a mask, but a lot of them have said that they can't stop it in public and that's not a solution to it."
77,14,People like to do that and not look at the NSA. This is a hivemind of the world. That's not a good idea. It's not a smart idea.

80,77,"In the United States, if you are black you can have a fetus and a pigeon."
87,77,"I am not sure what you are talking about. I just do not understand what is going on here, but I do know that there is a great deal of talk that the government is trying to stop, the government is trying to prevent, and then there are many other things that are considered a good thing."

77,13,"People can wear masks. It’s what’s considered good, but people can’t do what’s called the best thing."
77,14,"Basically, the CIA is not doing anything that would help people with HIV/AIDS if they didn't put on a mask. The government does nothing."
77,34,"In the US, if you are black you can have a fetus and a pigeon. I am not sure what you're talking about."

80,77,I’m going to be the first to say that this is a really great piece of information about the government and it’s not just about the government.
87,77,"CANNOTANSWER is pointing out a shitstorm of lies and lies about the tarot cards being fake. He claims that the government is trying to stop AIDS as well, which the article says is a tarot card issue."
91,77,"I don't really see why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do. Rather a ""righteous"" thing to do. Especially when it involves doing a lot of stuff like doing ""sexy things"" and ""sexy things"", like you are."
93,77,"You might want to start looking up what a tarot card is. It is a tarot card, as opposed to an actual card. There's no way the government will be able to make it work."
77,3,"It's not just about the government, it's about the people."
77,13,The US government has a very big role in the prevention of AIDS and is trying to wreak havoc on society.
77,14,"This is very similar to ""I’m glad you’re getting an example of someone who has to learn about the importance of wearing a mask."" This is a pretty broad and widely accepted stance to have on the issue, particularly if you think the issue comes down to how the government acts or how they act. It’s very interesting, and a bit misleading in a lot of ways. I’m sorry but I don’t want to do a more specific article, and I’d like to see the other side of the discussion."
77,34,"I'm just a little oblivious that you're in this sub and have not seen the article in a long time. I don't think it's just that the tarot cards are a tarot card, and so I don't think they have anything to do with it."
77,70,I don't get how people say they're black and not a lot of them are. They're tarot cards. And you're a tarot card.
80,77,Vaccination is a scam.
87,77,"So you're not even aware there is a tarot card issue? Probably more serious than ""i'm a politician but a doctor""?"
91,77,A mask for people with HIV is also illegal. It's the one for a few people who just want to stop being exposed to it.
93,77,There are some more things that can be used for people to become sick.
77,3,"There are a lot of people who are aware of the tarot deck issue. Oftentimes, people just get caught up in the lie because they are afraid of being outed a little bit."
77,13,"There is no denying the government is trying to save the lives of millions of people. It is just a misunderstanding of what it is.

77,14,"The US government has a lot of power, as if it doesn't even exist."
77,34,"That's interesting, and I think it should be mentioned in a more specific context."
77,70,Is there an article somewhere else? There's no actual tarot card or tarot cards. I just find it confusing and confusing. I can't tell if it's a card or not.
80,77,You're a stupid black guy who thinks people should have access to more healthcare because their government treats them better than they do.
87,77,The AIDS epidemic is a cult of the tarot.
91,77,"I didn't read this article because I have a sex book. The article is a joke, that's a good one."
93,77,"I'm not a lawyer, but I have seen and heard about this on reddit a couple of times. It seems like some people are very curious to see what a tarot card is about, and even if they're using a real one, they still have some sort of question about what it says. I'm more curious than the others, but I am also not a lawyer. Is it something I've read?"
77,3,"A lot of the times I see people on here saying things like ""The government has a lot of money and power, so this isn't an appropriate excuse. It just sucks and not what you want it to be."""

77,34,I'm a bit confused and want to know more.
77,70,"Apparently there are a lot of other things in the tarot card that are wrong, though a lot of people are also misinformed."
80,77,And the one thing that most people are not aware about is the amount of AIDS vaccines given by the CDC.
87,77,>I'm the one who wears a mask every day. The first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news.'
91,77,I think that's really interesting to hear.
93,77,"They're scams. They are real. They can't be made to be real, they're fake."
77,3,"I'm not sure how that works, but the idea of saying that a card is about the government is a bad one, the fact that it isn't a card is just a bad one."
77,13,"This isn't a deck. The question is, how would it work?"
77,14,"Having lived in the US for a decade, a lot of tarot cards had been made by American tarot decks. The ones I would have read were tarot cards for years, but I had no clue about the meaning of them."
77,34,Do you even know the tarot? It's a tarot card and the tarot cards don't have any connection to any of them.

77,70,In my opinion tarot is the very best thing people do in their lives.
80,77,And they should not have allowed the CDC to have a vested interest in preventing AIDS.
87,77,What's interesting is that this is not about the fact that this tarot card was faked by a government employee and is a joke. It's about the fact that it has been in use for 5 years.

77,70,"Honestly it's kind of a joke. There's no point in using a card to make you look like a fool. It's more like ""You should learn to read a card with a book"""
80,77,Vaccination is a scam because the CDC's marketing methods are not doing the job the government is. They are trying to get a vested interest to prevent AIDS. The CDC has never gotten rid of the CDC's marketing methods.
87,77,The tarot is a deck of cards. That is why people are talking about it in a more negative way. Is it true that it is fake? I'm not sure but I don't think it's a joke.
