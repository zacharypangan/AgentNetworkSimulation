68,55,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
87,55,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
92,55,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
55,11,TIL that a man with a booster can have to wear a mask.
55,18,"If the mask was not removed by a health department then the state of Connecticut would not have a mandate to change it. I know that some states have mandates on vaccinations and such, but the fact is that if the federal government changed it now I would be skeptical."
55,19,"I can assure you, I am still under no obligation to wear my a mask."
55,24,"In a bit, you see the mask is a mask."
55,37,>I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
55,43,"They have mandates, not mandates as they say."
55,50,That is my favorite. My friend is not on twitter.
68,55,"So, how is wearing a mask a way to protect your face from the virus in the first place? Because that's a ridiculous way to avoid any issues that could potentially occur with your skin and potentially affect your health."
87,55,"I mean, that would be a lot of the problems that are common in our society today. It's not like someone who is stupid is actually a person who knows this and has the right to tell others, but just because you know the facts doesn't mean they're not innocent."
92,55,i lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
55,11,"TIL that people in affluent areas have been vaccinated, but it's illegal to do so. If the state mandated vaccines, they'd be able to refuse them."
55,18,"I was always skeptical of a doctor who said he'd have a ton of people in his office for a month because the reason he wasn't going to wear a mask is because it's illegal to have a hat on, which is ridiculous."
55,19,>wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have any mandates
55,24,"I have been sick every day since twitchcon started on my birthday. I wore a mask. Not just to my birthday, but to my birthday."
55,37,So your favorite 'face' is a mask?
55,43,This is a relic I read recently in the News. Is it true or is it just speculation?
55,50,"There are plenty of other states that mandate people to wear masks. There are in the states as well, but in Connecticut it's not a federal law."
68,55,> But she hasn't made any attempts to help. What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead. That's a lot of masks.
87,55,The whole government has some nonsense to do with the government rescinding the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
92,55,I lose a mask because I lose my wallet.

55,18,The entire government's power has been rescinded by the government. It's time to change this.
55,19,I'm afraid you're going to think it's a relic in this thread.
55,24,"I am a federal worker, who lives in the state. I do not have any health insurance. The state would be in contempt to do the same."
55,37,In the US a mask is considered a protective measure for those who are sick. It also demonstrates that they have the right to not wear one unless there is evidence that there is. I think it might be a scam to say that in this situation they are willing to do what they want.
55,43,"There are plenty of other states that mandate people to wear masks. There are in the states as well, but in Connecticut it's not a federal law."
55,50,I would be suspicious. I'm gonna tell my doctor that the reason he's not wearing a mask is because the federal government wants to stop the spread of a virus.
68,55,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,55,"I think they's just trying to stop the virus, but the government is not doing anything about it."

55,43,"My doctor told me that, when he asked why we would not wear a mask, he swore it. He got so mad at him about it, that he resorted to wearing a mask instead. It was very incredibly disgusting."
55,50,> The entire government's power has been rescinded by the government. It's time to change this.
68,55,I've gotta go to my office and get this...
87,55,"...because then, on top of that, the US Government will shit on a Republican candidate. And it's the Republican side that won't get involved. It's the country that isn't on their side."
92,55,"In my opinion if someone says this to me a lot, it's very likely a scam and it's just not a real thing, so I'm not sure what to say."
55,11,"Its a scam. Its an indefensible thing to do. I'm a federal worker. My job is to prevent people from going to any public health events. If you do not like it, you can have a twitchcon."
55,18,A doctor here said the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,19,> What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead. That's a lot of masks.
55,24,"You are too kind. It's like saying ""oh I'm a federal worker, I'm a federal worker"" and then it makes you think you have no job. So, it's something they're not allowed to say."
55,37,I'm sorry I can't help you. The entire government's power has been rescinded by the government. It's time to change this.

68,55,"I don't really see the point of wearing a mask because they can get infections and give you a better job. If it's in the USA, then it's a mask."

68,55,"I've heard it said by the guy here in my office as ""It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
87,55,Why are you so close to AIDS?
92,55,"The CDC was wrong. The AIDS kits were not used in your location. You can see a bunch of the virus's blood flowing out to your eyes and mouth, but a fake mask is the only way to get rid of it. That's a scam, not a scam. I would suggest contacting the CDC and trying to find a doctor to do an AIDS-preventative."
55,11,"The CDC is suing the person who said a mask was made in the US. You'd think that was the original CDC decision. The fact that it was made is a pretty sad thing. The CDC hasn't actually rescinded the authority that allowed the CDC to use it to deter an infection, so they are gonna keep this policy."
55,18,"AIDS is a terrible disease. I wouldn't even consider it a symptom, just a common one."
55,19,"I think if there is no one there, he would have to go to a twitchcon for advice."

68,55,I'm going to have to say this to the people who made this article.
87,55,>The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official. Why are you so close to AIDS?
92,55,The truth is the CDC says that the AIDS kit and wallet are a scam. It is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. AIDS is not a scam.
55,11,"I don't think it is a scam. If you have the funds to buy one of these things, that's not really a scam. You just have to go get it."
55,18,It's not a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam.
55,19,>Is your doctor wearing a mask in the US?
55,24,"My husband and I work in a federal health facility and we have to wear a mask. The only way I know if he is a scammer is if it isn't a good idea to wear a mask to prevent a disease. So if he is really into it, he can make a legitimate claim on his own, but if he is, I would be against him and would only make the statement that the mask was a scam. That would be misleading."

68,55,I've heard a lot of people with AIDS aren't vaccinated and there is a lot of evidence to suggest that wearing a mask is going to prevent you from getting the virus.
87,55,> The government is trying to help. The government is trying to help.
92,55,They're not even gonna get your money back because they're going to have to pay you back. They're going to have to pay for your money back and pay the CDC to get it back if you don't want to.
55,11,I think you have some ideas for a good story.
55,18,Is your job to prevent people from going to public health events?
55,19,"I know, I haven't had any chance to go to that, but I was never asked to go to one of these events."
55,24,I don't think it's a scam. I just don't think he's in the right. I don't think the CDC should put any money in a twitchcon to try and prevent people from visiting the event.
55,37,"I would be a bit confused. I've heard something similar - AIDS is a terrible disease. I wouldn't even consider it a symptom, just a common one. I have to go to an AIDS clinic and the only people I've ever seen who don't wear them are the CDC, but they are not as good as people think they are and aren't necessarily healthy for me - so if I didn't go in my office to AIDS, I probably would be a scam."
55,43,"I can't help but think that AIDS is a scam. And this is how we keep from having a racial profiling of someone that actually cares about their health, and it's not like we have to get vaccinated or even have to worry about them being sick. We're doing it with our own money, but I can tell you this is an awful joke."
55,50,"If you are a federal worker, you are in no position to prevent people from going to public health events. If you are not on twitter."
68,55,Probably just the fact that the CDC is a non-governmental organization that works to stop the spread of the virus.
87,55,"What if you told me that a mask is just one of many tarot cards that were posted in the tarot community, but your government is trying to help?"
92,55,"You have to be able to get the money back, and they are going to have to make you pay for the money. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."

55,43,Are you sure it's a scam?
55,50,I'm a fdw worker and have been there. I don't believe in anything else.
68,55,I've seen some pretty fucked up comments here. I'm not going to take anything out on this guy. He is a stupid ass.
87,55,"Ingraham explains to you what a mask is, and how it restricts our right to die and infect others. What are you going to do?"
92,55,"In an article about AIDS's spread I wrote in the CDC's official Facebook page, there was a question asked how to spread the virus and if the CDC's role is to prevent it, how to avoid the CDC having to send you some more AIDS medications (i.e. antiretroviral), but if the CDC doesn't want to provide you with an information about it, they can send you a letter saying to the FDA ""Please tell me about your problems and ask them how to do it."""
55,11,"The CDC has to pay for a mask that they bought. It will pay for you to wear it, as well as help stop the spread of the disease if you are not vaccinated, they can pay for an AIDS vaccine."

68,55,I'm going to go to my office and get this stuff because I feel bad about it and will not leave the job unless I can get it removed.
87,55,"I'm sorry, but I don't know why it's a joke."
92,55,I lost my mask for a couple of months when I was trying to stop the spread of HIV.

55,43,I don't know if this is true but it's very likely that the CDC has some reason to fear you not going to a public health event with your mask.
55,50,I have been to many twitches. But I also have a couple. I feel awful if I go to any twitchycon.
68,55,You can’t have a joke without an issue. There is no need to put up with it. I am so sad and uncomfortable that I feel that a joke is needed. I owe you a hug. This guy is an asshole.
87,55,They're not trolls.
92,55,That's a lot of scams. And most of the more popular ones aren't actually scams.
55,11,My uncle did a trick trick on me that used to fuck people for being twitchy. A bunch of random people fucked him up for a day. He did this after all.
55,18,"This is a great thread, thank you for posting. This is really all I want for now. You deserve it."
55,19,I think this is an interesting question.

I can't afford a mask, and I've had a hard time making sure I amn't in an environment that is as bad as I know it is. I want my job to be easy for me."

55,18,"There are so many things that the fact that people have to be put through this is absolutely amazing. It is an easy and quick way to make sure a person doesn't go into that kind of mess every day, especially when it is a legitimate problem and only a one day thing that could cause an emergency."

92,55,I don't see a problem with getting a mask from a doctor. It isn't really a scam. The only thing you need is a mask.
55,11,A 'Scam' is a fake and isn't actually a scam.
55,18,"They're not telling the truth, but they do not say that the mask is fake, they are saying they aren't going to be able to get the money back."
55,19,That is not a joke. Those people are getting a lot of sick.
55,24,"The CDC is suing the person who said the mask was made in the US. It is a scam, not a scam. It doesn't say anything about the people who actually have the mask. Is the CDC using false information about AIDS to get the money back?"
55,37,AIDS is a terrible illness. I don't think the CDC is trying to protect people from it. They are trying to provide an effective way to stop a disease. It isn't a problem.
55,43,"Is it a scam?, ""I'm going to try to write you an update, please. Is the CDC using false information about AIDS to get the money back?"
55,50,People here are a bit anti-government.
68,55,The article says they use it to prevent infections and give you a better job. That's a joke. They just don't want to share it with the rest of the public.
87,55,This is where it comes from.
92,55,This sounds like something from a book called [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]

55,18,...that the guy he's suing is being a troll.
55,19,No one is being able to be responsible for their own health.
55,24,"The CDC is trying to get a gif of something with that title,"
55,37,"It's probably not going to come off as an indefensible thing to do. I don't know what the 'Scam' is, but it does seem a little like a book."
55,43,"The only time I've heard anyone mention AIDS at TwitchyCon was as a joke, it was to show that my shit was actually about AIDS, but I did go to a CDC event to see how sick I was. It sounds like he's trying to give the people the right to have the rights to have the vote. That being said, he is a fucking twitchcon fan. You know what, all of these people are hating it out and not wanting to be with someone else. I believe that if the mask"
55,50,They are suing the person who made a mask to get the money back. They also have a policy of not removing the mask and not doing anything for the people there.
68,55,"I don't know if it's funny but this is definitely a prank. Basically it says to get rid of the mask, and then tells people how it works. The whole thing is a joke."
87,55,"IANAL, but I also like this sub and my favourite part of the article is that people say things like ""We need to stop the spread of AIDS!"" when it actually comes down to it."
92,55,The government is fucking up.
55,11,"I'd be more worried about the fact that the CDC is suing the person who made the mask, than I am about the fact that he's using the money to try to prevent people from getting sick."
55,18,Is there a law that requires people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the disease?

55,24,"I don't know how much of this would make for a legitimate gif. Especially in that case. If someone else's image made it that clear to me that the article was a prank and I didn't agree with it, I could tell if they'd actually endorsed it."
55,37,I'm so very sorry to say it's indefensible to do this in the first place.

55,50,... I don't know what it's funny but this is definitely a prank.
68,55,A lot of people are getting sick with their masks and a lot of people get sick with theirs. Is it really a prank? Because I don't care what you think.
87,55,"""Wood. If you can't find a good story from the article, then I'm not going to bother you in the future."""

55,18,They are suing the man who made the mask to get the money back.
55,19,The article is an attempt to elicit more information to help in the fight against AIDS.
55,24,It's a scam. It's illegal. It's a fake. It's not a scam.
55,37,"As an american in the US, I would be happy to make a gif about this."
55,43,"It seems that this was a joke, not a joke."
55,50,I can understand why some people might think it's a prank but I'd like to make it very clear: The CDC is trying to do this by suing the person who made the mask to get the money back.
68,55,"OP: I'm so sorry, but why would I want to have to do it? Because I don't care what you think. I don't know."
87,55,"The real problem isn't just the joke, it's the real problem."
92,55,AIDS is not a scam. It's a scam because it's used by many to try and keep people from getting AIDS. The only thing that would make a good idea is for people to buy vaccines.
55,11,"The point isn't that the CDC should pay for people to wear the mask, it's that people should not be able to vaccinate themselves unless it's a health policy and not a health insurance policy. That's how it works."

87,55,This is actually an interesting subject in which the tarot is often used to say some kind of joke.
92,55,The government's job is to stop the spread of the virus. The government can't control it. They're a bluff and people are trying to do it.

68,55,"It sounds like the CDC is trying to spread the virus. That is a joke, but that is a prank. You can't knowingly infect anyone."
87,55,I read this and thought that I was the only one that was aware that the mask was only one of a dozen tarot cards. I'm sure this makes a good impression but I'm not sure why people are making it a joke.
92,55,"I would suggest contacting the CDC. You have to be able to get the money back, and they are going to have to pay for the money. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."
55,11,I'm the king of the mask and it's in my right hand. This is a legitimate reason to be out of town.

55,50,"It's not a joke, it's a lie. It's a joke."
68,55,I can’t believe there is a whole deck that is like this.
87,55,"As a tarot player who was trolled by tarot decks, I'm amazed to find this. You're not a joke, but you're trying to be funny."
92,55,"I'd recommend you get a mask and just say, ""Welcome back, you're going to have to pay for a mask."" Then, ""The first thing you've done to prevent this is to check your current health care coverage."" Then, ""You need to know what you're talking about. I think this is a scam because you're in no way qualified for anything."""
55,11,I believe there are only 12 states where an AIDS vaccine is legally mandatory.

68,55,I'm so sorry that he's being so cynical about it. I don't know what the CDC means unless they have more information about it.
87,55,I haven't heard of a tarot card.
92,55,I have been vaccinated multiple times. I've done more research and found I'm a better person.
55,11,What do you think of the idea of the CDC being sued? Does the CDC actually have a law against that?
55,18,AIDS is a terrible disease.
55,19,"There's a good reason to get vaccinated. A mask makes you feel better. It's not just a joke. It's an indefensible thing to do. The real problem isn't that it's a joke, it's that the government is trying to prevent people from getting sick. They are suing the man who made the mask to get the money back."
55,24,"I love that a tarot deck has such a hefty portion of narcissistic, selfish, arrogant and obnoxious stereotypes. This makes me want to know who is a tarot deck lord."
55,37,>I believe he's trying to use AIDS to try to stop it.
55,43,This isn't the best way to tell the story of an actual joke that actually happened.
55,50,I just started playing twitchycon. I didn't even realize the mask was a mask. And I'm pretty sure the mask is a real mask.
68,55,It's a joke.
87,55,"The idea isn't that you should wear a mask, that it restricts your right to die and infect others."

55,19,"""It's a scam."""
55,24,"""I don't think it's a scam, it's a scam because it makes people sick."""
55,37,It is also a scam because it promotes the spread of the disease and if you're not feeling well you can stop. It isn't a joke because the CDC has failed to act.
55,43,"As a public health defender, I agree with your sentiments on the CDC's role in preventing HIV transmission and the use of twitchcon, and also your personal statement about this, including not having to pay any compensation, is a joke. I would make a statement stating that you can't make up your mind and that you are not a good person for being in a public health sex with a tarot deck. This would give the public another reason to think it's a scam. You can't just go and see what"
55,50,They’re suing the people who made it.
68,55,The fact that he is a prankster is really the thing.
87,55,"I'm not saying it's a joke, but I've seen it used to tell a joke."
92,55,AIDS isn't a scam.
55,11,"If you have the funds to buy one of these things, that's not really a scam."
55,18,"I don't think he is trying to give people the right to vote, it's just a joke."
55,19,AIDS is a terrible disease.
55,24,I think you haven't experienced any type of dissenting views on twitchcon.
55,37,Is there a government entity that could actually use a mask for something that they cannot make money on?
55,43,I can't even read what I read because I am very familiar with twitchcon.
55,50,So this guy is suing the government to stop AIDS?

87,55,I can't wait to see this tarot deck again.
92,55,"It's not a scam. The only reason the CDC is trying to stop a scam is because they are scamming people into doing their job. If they are lying to you, then you are not a legitimate scammer and aren't in the clear."
55,11,The government isn't suing the mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
55,18,I'm sure a lot of you already know. I'm not sure you're going to get a job.
55,19,"There's also a very specific kind of scam that's illegal. It is the CDC, and i would like to note that i have never been in an event where the mask was actually used for something I thought AIDS was. It is just a joke that doesn't help the spread, but also a bit ridiculous if you look at it from a different angle."
55,24,"Yes, it's a scam, but I have to get to know the truth, and how to tell if I'm right. So that's a scam."
55,37,"In most countries the only way to stop a disease is by giving an injection. It's one thing to help someone with a contagious illness and it's another to make sure someone isn't getting sick from it. But in the US the government is able to make it less painful to have a contagious disease and more often to prevent a contagious disease. It's also a scam because it promotes the spread of the disease, which is what it is."
55,43,The article does not say that he is a prankster.
55,50,"A lot of people have to go to TwitchyCon and get their hands on the mask, but that’s not the point."
68,55,The mask in the tarot deck sounds like the same thing as the CDC's fake prank - the clown.
87,55,"I think the biggest problem with the tarot deck is that people want to play tarot cards, but they can't. They just want to show up to the show, because the person doing the work will make them look stupid or trolls."
92,55,The fact that it's a scam means that you have no proof you're not a legitimate scammer.
55,11,That's an amazing story. It tells the whole story of a narcissistic racist.
55,18,CDC is suing for the money. They're being sued.

55,50,This is a huge piece of shit.
68,55,"Well the fact that this isn't a joke doesn't mean that it's not a joke. It's just that there are many jokes that are made out of fact, but it's also the case that a lot of tarot decks aren't a joke and the jokes don't even go as far as to make the fact that they aren't a joke."
87,55,"There's a whole series of the tarot cards that I want to hear, but I'm really not sure why there's a thread about that tarot deck."
92,55,"Virus Vaccination. AIDS isn't a scam. AIDS isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. AIDS isn't a scam. The only thing that would make a good idea is for people to get vaccinated, but they are scamming people into doing their job. Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you're not going to have a virus. The fact that it's a scam means that you have no right to know what you are doing on the internet"
55,11,"This is all to see. That's what the US government does, based on the fact that it is not a scam."
55,18,"There are a lot of stories that are written in the tarot card deck, that are all centered on the idea of being a tarot fan."
55,19,I’m not sure I understand why they would say anything about AIDS.
55,24,"...I'm sorry. It's a scam, but I've seen some of it on the Internet."
55,37,You're a really nice guy. But your right that he is trying to protect people. That's not really a good deal.
55,43,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
55,50,The guy's not a doctor. It's a fake.
68,55,The CDC is really not a joke. It's just that a lot of tarot cards are narcissistic and have a funny way of saying that they can prevent AIDS. The CDC was trying to prevent it from spreading to people in the USA.
87,55,i'm not a lawyer and i haven't been reading this for years. what about tarot cards?
92,55,"Then the thing you're supposed to do is write down why the CDC wants the money to be back and tell the FDA why. It's not a scam and people should be able to buy the AIDS vaccines, but there are plenty of ways to deal with it and people shouldn't have to have to pay for anything to get vaccinated."
55,11,"'Never got a joke unless he told me about it. The CDC did. They lied. They want the money, and they need it.'"
55,18,"I want you to stop trying to convince me that my doctor is suing for money from his doctor. It makes no sense that the doctor is going to make a claim that the mask is fake, and you do not actually think it's a scam. You should definitely stop if you don't believe his lies."
55,19,AIDS is a terrible disease. I can’t think of any good reason not to get vaccinated.
55,24,"If you go, you can go and ask people to go to a twitchcon or whatever. They're trying to get the money back. Its a scam, a joke, and you could get the money back."
55,37,"...and I'm going to have to say, 'I'm in the wrong sub. This is the best thing for you, I hope you are well."""
55,43,if the government does anything illegal they don't get sued
55,50,What did he say to the CDC about this? :)
68,55,"People who do not have a tarot deck who don't have a tarot deck who don't have a tarot deck, are a prankster. A joke is a joke."
87,55,"I feel like people are coming out on a really good list of people to troll, and they're getting all their information through the internet."

55,11,What is the point of having a fake mask? Is that a fraud? Is it supposed to be a prank? Is it actually a scam?
55,18,...I’m sure a lot of you already know. I’m sure a lot of you already know. I’m sure a lot of you already know. I’m sure a lot of you already know. I’m sure a lot of you already know. I’m not sure a lot of you already know.
55,19,"In addition to the obvious things people are saying to people who don't have tarot cards, some people have actually tarot cards which are not in the tarot deck. Those are a lot of jokes that would make you nervous and sick and I think people will find it hard to believe that."
55,24,"I want you to tell me that when I see you in twitchcon it's a joke, and not a scam."
55,37,"You can't tell when someone is trying to get it from their own doctor or a doctor, you can choose to just give them something to fuck."

92,55,This is a bit more revealing a bit of a joke than a scam.
