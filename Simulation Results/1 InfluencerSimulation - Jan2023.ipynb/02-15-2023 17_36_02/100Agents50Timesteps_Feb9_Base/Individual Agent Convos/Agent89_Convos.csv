93,89,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
89,3,I'm glad they are getting better.
89,11,And I can see why the guy was doing that.
89,31,It's frightening how dumb they think all of it are.
89,45,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,54,"I have a mask that fits my nostrils, it doesn't make sense. I don't wear it because it's too much work and not enough sneeze if the smoke leaks."
89,74,It's terrifying how dumb they think all of is are.
93,89,"I've been wearing a mask the whole time, but it gets so annoying that I just want to wear a mask and get sick."
89,3,This is one of those people that needs help.
89,11,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

89,54,"I'm not a doctor, but I work in a health facility that provides a set of masks. I work on a lot of it."
89,74,I feel for you and that is a pretty sad situation. The world will change if I try it.
93,89,I think I've seen this in the movies. It's more terrifying that people try to use them or try to get their hands on a mask to avoid getting a bad cough.
89,3,"I live in a hazy area so I can only hear sneeze and smoke, but my best friend has a bad ear infection and we need to be vigilant and help him in every way possible."
89,11,What is the point of a mask? Because you're wearing a mask that doesn't fit your nose.
89,31,I don't think there is a good reason for people to wear a mask and suffer with one. I would have been a bit annoyed if someone else did that.
89,45,"You can wear a mask to avoid a bad cough, but it's a very expensive one. Also, it's quite uncomfortable."
89,54,That's a nice way to put it.
89,74,I am glad I am getting better.
93,89,I am terrified of people who do not wear masks. They don't want people to be sick because they are tripping out.
89,3,Isn't this something that is a pretty common joke in the US?
89,11,"'Oh, maroon, I can't see how you can use it to stop a virus!'"
89,31,"""I don't think there is a good reason for people to wear a mask and suffer with one. I would have been a bit annoyed if someone else did that."""
89,45,It's been a long time. I can’t imagine what you would have done if you weren’t wearing a mask.
89,54,"[Babie, I didn't know you were able to see my eyelids.](https://www.adv.org/) You need to see your nose first."
89,74,">I have a mask that fits my nostrils, it doesn't make sense. I don't wear it because it's too much work and not enough sneeze if the smoke leaks. It's terrifying how dumb they think all of it are."
93,89,"It's actually a very interesting fact of life, and people who wear masks are in fact getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads / schemes/ lies."
89,3,"It's a pretty common joke in the US, especially in the US where the government isn't giving the most reasonable advice on what's good for people in hazy areas. But there are also jokes that suggest people can't breathe in the same way because it's hard to breathe and because it's scary. The jokes in this post aren't from a medical field."
89,11,"I’m scared to wear a mask :) I live in a hazy area so I can only hear sneeze and smoke, but my best friend has a bad ear infection and we need to be vigilant and help him in every way possible. You need to see your nose first."
89,31,The CDC has a list of every fad that is being used to stop the spread of a virus.
89,45,"I know this isn't funny. But, to me it sounds like you have a very good cough - I would think it was a clogging up your throat."
89,54,"This is why you don't wear a mask at all, and because a mask is only a mask that is breathable."
89,74,It's really creepy because people who don't wear masks are actually getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads / schemes/ lies.
93,89,I have a big hole in my face. A lot of people do it because they can't wear a mask to avoid them getting sick.
89,3,"I can understand wearing a mask in a hazy area and how it can be really annoying to them, but I think it's the worst kind of fad to wear a mask for all fads."
89,11,I am just being frank about people wearing masks and I think it is funny. The point is the government has a list of every fad that is being used to stop the spread of a virus.
89,31,I'm very sick of this. I am still getting sick and I can't help it.
89,45,I feel so sorry for you. I am not a doctor but I know how sick it is /obviously I can not get out of my nose without wearing a mask.
89,54,"Unless it’s not a funny joke, I don’t think the joke is relevant here."
89,74,I am wearing a mask that doesn't fit my nostrils. It looks awfully uncomfortable and doesn't help.
93,89,You need to read the title.
89,3,"I am not a doctor, but I know how sick people get. I'm trying to help them in some way. They need help, they don't want to help with anything."
89,11,That's a really good question.
89,31,Is there any difference in how well you are breathing?
89,45,"This is a joke in the sense that they get stung by some bad jokes and then you make jokes about them, and you take the joke literally and literally. It's like a joke in the sense that people are not gonna make jokes about people without a mask if there are lots of things they're gonna do to stop the spread of the virus."
89,54,"""We want to protect our citizens against the dangers of masks."" Is that what the joke is supposed to mean?"
89,74,People who don't wear a mask are being bitten.
93,89,"I am not a lawyer, but I know a lot of people who are in fact getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads/ schemes/ lies. I had to wear a mask to a scary movie a few times. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel like I had to wear it to a scary movie a few times. I'm sorry."
89,3,This is a joke because it's a joke for people to feel sick while still wearing a mask.
89,11,They are just trying to keep the government from committing crimes that people are more likely to commit.
89,31,"It's not funny. If someone's a doctor whose job it is to save their life, they should be able to figure this out for them. There are a lot of things the government can do to help the sick."
89,45,"If I were a doctor, I would say it's the CDC's job to prevent a bacterial infection."
89,54,This is actually the one you need to read the title and read through this post. This is a lot of information about masks.
89,74,"The title is more about the joke, the fad."
93,89,I'm very excited to read your reply to me.
89,3,I am sick of these jokes. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them.
89,11,There is nothing funny about a mask. Its just a joke.
89,31,We are looking into these things here. I think this was made to show that they are helping people.
89,45,You know what I mean. I'm sick of this. I'm still getting sick. I'm still getting sick. I'm getting sick. I can't imagine what you would have done if you weren't wearing a mask. It's been a long time. I can't imagine what you would have done if you weren't wearing a mask.
89,54,"I don’t wear a mask, but I do know that if a sick person wears one, they don’t have to deal with it, so the CDC is going to keep trying to prevent people from committing a crime that people are more likely to commit."
89,74,"I feel for you, it's not funny but this is going to be a pretty interesting post for a while."
93,89,"I'm not saying it is a good idea, but it's misleading. The government is a scam. It's just that they are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
89,3,"I'm not a doctor, but I know a lot of people who are getting bitten by these things. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them. I am sick of them.

They are trying to evade the government."
89,11,I've been in the military. This is not a joke.
89,31,I don't think that there's a good reason for people to wear a mask to get sick. I do think that some people would be able to deal with it better with a mask because of the risk of being bitten.
89,45,"There is nothing funny about a mask. The government is a scam. It's just that they are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
89,54,I'm sick of this. I can't imagine what I would have done if I weren't wearing a mask.
89,74,It seems that you are taking the joke literally and literally.
93,89,"The government is a scam, it's just that they are trying to evade the government's money, and not the people."
89,3,"I've had this story, I was a doctor. I don't wear my mask, but I think it's part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus."
89,11,A lot of people seem to take the joke literally and literally.

There are a lot of things the government can do to help the sick."
89,45,There's not much you can do to make the joke. You are a sick person and you don't need a mask.
89,54,"I am not saying that it's a joke, but it is misleading."
89,74,This is a new idea.
93,89,"The people who say they do it to keep out viruses and all, say it's a scam. But the people that do it don't want to tell the truth."
89,3,I am actually sick of wearing a mask.
89,11,"I'm a doctor and have no fucking idea how a mask actually works. It seems that the joke is a joke. I think it's a good idea, but it's not going to get more popular."
89,31,Getting bitten by a virus with a mask is not just a joke. If you're sick and sick and sick it means if you're not sick you shouldn't be doing the same thing. If you are sick you should do the same thing with your mask.
89,45,CANNOTANSWER : Having a virus doesn't suck - it sucks - so it doesn't really work.
89,54,Basically... it's a joke about how a government employee should not wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading.
89,74,"""I don't wear my mask because it's too much work and not enough sneeze if the smoke leaks. It's terrifying how dumb they think all of is are."""
93,89,"It's really pretty scary, and it's a lot better than a fake tarot card. The whole point of a tarot card is to avoid tripping out, and the other end is to keep things real, so that they can use the fake ones to get rid of them and make money for the government. It's really interesting. I'd start talking about it, not tarot cards. Especially since this is a joke, just a tarot card."
89,3,I think a tarot card is a joke that's meant to be used as a sort of eulogy for how people are going to die and how things are going to go wrong.
89,11,I'd give the guy a hug for wearing a mask. He's in a good place. He's a really smart guy.
89,31,"""Anonymity is in our name. I don't believe I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am sick of this. I am still getting sick and I can't help it."""

89,54,"People in the military should know, right? Unless they’re medically ill, and have a lot of money, they don’t need a mask."
89,74,"The best way to avoid tripping out is to take the mask and get rid of the virus and get a fake tarot card, and keep the fake tarot cards."
93,89,The government is trying to get rid of them and make money for the government.
89,3,"...I am not saying that it's a joke, but it is misleading."
89,11,"A mask is a joke, a joke that is not funny."
89,31,"I read the whole thing and can't stand that a joke can't be really true. I think it is really funny, but not funny enough to make sense."

89,54,This guy has a serious infection.
89,74,"It's an old joke. It is a joke, and people have been talking about it for years. It's funny how a joke can be so misleading. It's not funny. But there is no such thing as a joke."
93,89,I'm assuming you're being serious?
89,3,"It's a joke, but it is a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke."

89,74,"I got this card from my mom when I was in high school, it was a tarot. I was like - oh, you gotta tell me - a lot of fun. The tarot cards were not just a joke, they were a way to get rid of the virus. They were tarot cards and actually did a job to spread the virus in the USA (iirc, I thought the tarot cards were supposed to have a mask that fit the nose). I read a little later, and figured out"
93,89,"It's the biggest issue I've heard a lot lately. It seems like some people are very curious to see what a tarot card is about, and even if they're using a fake one, they still have some sort of question about what it says."
89,3,I'm sick of people that get stung by a tarot card.
89,11,It sounds to me like the guy who has a virus is really scared to wear a mask. He probably has a really bad infection.
89,31,"I think some people are really curious to see what a tarot card is about, and even if they're using a fake one, they still have some sort of question about what it says."

89,54,"I am sorry but the way I phrased it, when I found out about this card - and I had to look it up, I couldn't get myself to read it in all the ways it says it does. I just had a hard time feeling good because it was a joke."
89,74,"Is this one actually the joke? I have been told I could not afford to have a tarot card on my hand and if it did, i'd have a whole bunch of people get bitten, nippled and scream for help. It's not really a joke because the idea is ""nothing funny"" or is there really any other type of joke you can use to find out what's going on?"
