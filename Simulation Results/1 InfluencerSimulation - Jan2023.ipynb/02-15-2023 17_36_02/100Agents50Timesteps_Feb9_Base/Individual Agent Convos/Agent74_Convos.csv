89,74,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
74,8,A lot of sports coaches don't wear a mask anymore.
74,15,I know I have to take some chances because I am an admin of the hockey olympic team. I want a team to play for me so that I can do well against the most difficult opponents and not be thrown in the mix.

74,17,That's just an assumption.
74,18,This is ridiculous i feel bad for them because i'm the only one who actually believes a helmet must be properly worn i just feel it's way more fucked up than a mask
74,31,"If we can coach a player who is wearing a mask as a rule, it will stop at least partly because it is part of a mandatory hat, but the helmet is a requirement for the uniform to work properly and the team is expected to wear it properly if they go to a game, the rules for that being the case if they go to a game."
74,32,I am a huge fan of this.
74,33,"i like wearing a mask, but i m sick of the prank."
74,35,This sub is full of very stupid stuff. I guess people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask. IMO we need to find a way to hide the danger and protect the players. I think if you’re in the rn you’ll have to show up a little too far and be suckered over the fact that the coach is not doing what he’s supposed to do.
74,40,"I'm gonna be my assistant coach next week, I think its a great time to be an official."
74,42,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
74,45,A good coach will be the one whose responsibility is to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by a truck.
74,46,"I am really curious as to how he could be resigning so quickly, but as soon as he does that's a big enough reason to resign, it's a huge reason to resign, I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop a new viral infection."
74,48,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that.
74,49,Wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I love coaching
74,53,When did they go to college to go into coaching? That’s what I’ve been trying to do for years.

74,63,"I am a hockey coach and I am not a coach, but I do not care if we are playing well or not. I'm just happy that we're playing."
74,64,yup. i think it may have been a a little better to have that type of helmet on a team where a player is on more than one of the most important teams in the sport.
74,70,I love coaching although if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense

89,74,It's terrifying how dumb they think all of is are.
74,8,A lot of sports coaches don't wear a mask anymore.
74,15,"I hate to be the one who explains this but the question is, how much of what is supposed to be put on your helmet?"

74,17,"I'm not gonna be the best coach, but if he didn't make this a priority for a long time, he'd be in no position to ever be a coach in my life. It's more likely to happen at the start of the year, but if I were in a coach, I'd have to make sure he wasn't wearing a mask for a while, and to keep his mind off his head."
74,18,I'm just going to assume that this sub has the same problem.

74,33,"I've been told to get a new mask from a friend of mine, and if she doesn't like it I want to play for a friend of mine. The last time I tried it was the first time she got shit from me. I just thought it was pretty funny, as I think they said they are going to have to wear the mask so they can see the danger if they see me. So I walked away from the game and said, ""Fuck my face, I just want to see my face."
74,35,"I love hockey players with my own hair, my dang hair, and my shirt. I'm a great guy, but my husband hates his hat."
74,40,I think you need to understand what a mask is. A good one is a helmet.
74,42,I am a hockey coach and I have no interest in hockey.
74,45,I would resign and not work with a guy who is not a team coach.
74,46,There's so much that can be done to stop the spread of a virus.

74,49,"I mean this guy, in a team I work for and I am a terrible coach, a big fan of his. He is an ace and he needs to be able to get to the point where he's being a hero and not the reason to resign. But the guy has been a rn head coach for 4 years."
74,53,">I am really curious as to how he could be resigning so quickly, but as soon as he does that's a big enough reason to resign, it's a huge reason to resign, I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop a new viral infection."
74,56,I have no idea how you haven't learned that the government hasn't done anything that's not going to be able to do...
74,58,"I'm just kidding about your username, it's crazy."
74,63,I hate that there are people out there who are not actually interested in their field and I can't even imagine what it's like to not be a coach. I don't think it's a good idea for a coach to wear a mask to protect a player. It doesn't make any sense for a coach to wear a mask without the player having to be a legitimate safety threat.
74,64,"I'm gonna go ahead and say that a lot of the time this is all nonsense, but the fact that the government's attempts to prevent the spread of a virus are totally unrelated is beyond me."
74,70,I don't understand this.
74,73,I just think this is more of an ironic prank. I know it isn't necessary to be a good coach but as a coach I'm very interested in if I get a mask - and the fact that my team does not use it at all to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by trucks. Having this helmet is ridiculous.
81,74,"> I have a few friends who were under the age of 26 and in my hometown are still wearing masks and helmets. They just don't wear them unless they know they're infected by some of the most common stuff they see on TV. Then if they don't take the time to address the issue and make a resolution, it's a scam."
89,74,I feel for you and that is a pretty sad situation. The world will change if I try it.
74,8,"I don't think this is a prank, this is an actual incident."
74,15,Why does this sound like a prank?
74,16,"I have to say, I'm a fan of this. It's not a prank but a warning. That's a pretty simple thing to do. They are making a lot of people uncomfortable and they really are not willing to change their hats to prevent the spread of viruses that they are not used to."
74,17,Getting a new mask and making a decision about whether or not to continue to wear it is a prank.
74,18,"I'm a soccer player, and I wear a mask to protect the players when they come on the field."
74,31,"If a team is putting up with the government's inability to prevent a virus, then there is no way to stop it from happening. And while it does stop it, if they don't, the team will still not be able to stop it from happening."
74,32,I like the guy. It's kind of funny how he's saying they have to wear a mask if they see him.
74,33,It seems like this subreddit is overloaded with the same sorts of nonsense OP's friend and I have to agree with you in this:
74,35,"So the fact that you walked away from the game and said, ""Fuck my face, I just want to see my face. I love hockey players with my own hair, my dang hair, and my shirt. I'm a great guy, but my husband hates his hat. I think you need to understand what a mask is. A good one is a helmet. I'm a great guy, but my husband hates his hat. I think you need to understand what a mask is."
74,40,"It's a joke, a joke. The guy has a problem, not you. But you are not in it."
74,42,My husband hates his helmet. I'm sorry he's not a hockey coach but I'm not a hockey coach.
74,45,I love the game. Especially with the helmet.
74,46,It's a prank.
74,48,>I'm just going to assume that this sub has the same problem. It's terrifying how dumb they think all of is are.
74,49,"In a little over a year and a half, I've found that we can get a few people out of this, who are very supportive and considerate of a young child. They have a very good understanding of what the public is capable of and how to act appropriately."
74,53,I think it's funny because you made up your mind to take it in the way it does.
74,56,"The issue isn't a mask, it's a helmet. The problem is that a mask has to be used by the government to stop a virus. A mask is basically a shirt with the puck attached to it."
74,58,I am a horrible hockey coach. I don't understand why you don't care.
74,63,I love hockey but I don't care if we're playing well or not. I'm just happy that we're playing. I'm just happy that we're playing.

It's a way of looking at how the game was going, but it doesn't really mean that they need to wear a mask or a hat. This kind of mask is a way of looking at how people like their sport, not just the ones who don't wear hats."

74,31,"This is not a prank, it's a prank. You should wear a mask to protect your players."
74,32,"That's the most fucked up thing I've ever heard on Reddit. I have read this before, i love coaching."
74,33,"There are a ton of examples here, and I'm not sure that the first comment sounded pretty serious and is actually very good if you're a hockey coach. I just want to share a couple of points that I disagree with you about and give the point that 'in my opinion, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'."
74,35,I think the guy needs to learn what a mask is. A good one is a helmet.
74,40,The president is one of the biggest dicks in the country. Probably a bit of a jerk.
74,42,"I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke, but that doesn't mean it's not a prank. That's the whole point of having a prank: to stop the spread of AIDS. That's what a prank is."
74,45,The president doesn't really need a mask.
74,46,No joke. A hockey coach prank isn't a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. A prank on someone who pranks on them is a joke.
74,48,"I know a lot of people who can't go into the details of this story, but a lot of the people that have had AIDS have also had some difficulty with the condition of their helmet, especially when it comes to avoiding getting infected."
74,49,"I am a little confused. The guy is a hockey coach and is an official fucking coach. He was saying that he would not wear a mask until he found someone who would suck it up and leave the team because he is a hockey coach. I don't want to get sick if someone fucks up and comes on stage and says 'Wow! This guy has been a prankster '. I don't think he is making any sense at all, but the fucking coach should be working on "
74,53,">When did they go to college to go into coaching? That’s what I’ve been trying to do for years.',"
74,56,A prank that only works because the president wore a mask is a joke if you're not really interested in it.

74,63,"So what's the joke? It's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense."
74,64,In that case I would get a mask. I would resign and not wear it.
74,70,It sounds like a bit of a remark that I’m not a hockey coach if I’m not wearing a mask.
74,73,It is a joke and a joke.
81,74,"I'm not being sarcastic. The guy who is referring to the government as a tarot card is an asshole. I've been around this subreddit for decades, but not to this point. He has a reputation for putting peoples lives at risk. That's why I have people like his."
89,74,"It's an old joke. It is a joke, and people have been talking about it for years. It's funny how a joke can be so misleading. It's not funny. But there is no such thing as a joke."
74,8,This guy is getting a bad rap about it. The hat is going to ruin the hat and you don't have to wear it.
74,15,"'As in, I don't think a mask is a joke'"

74,17,He has a reputation for putting peoples lives at risk. That's why I have people like his.
74,18,"In this case the president is a dick and not a joke, because he says he needs a mask, and the other guy is just trying to talk to his wife, not himself."
74,31,"IANAL, but not quite the right way to put it."
74,32,"I hate to sound like a jerk, but it's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."

74,46,"I'd like to say that in order for this to be an actual joke, the president needs to get the hat on. The president can't use a mask without having the shirt on."
74,48,Apparently the coach was referring to a tarot card in the beginning and he said he thinks he is just as racist as a politician.
74,49,I think that your explanation of the government's failure to protect people's lives is a bit ridiculous. A joke is one. It's one.
74,53,What a snarky asshole. The guy who's a hockey coach wore a mask to stop AIDS is an asshole. The guy is being a dick and a prankster.
74,56,"I think you're missing the point of OP's comment. If a guy could actually wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS, would that be funny?"
74,58,I'm glad you like this joke...
74,63,I love hockey but I don't care if we're playing well or not. I'm just happy that we're playing. I'm just happy that we're playing. I love hockey but I don't care if we're playing well or not. I'm just happy that we're playing. I'm just happy that we're playing.
74,64,"You can do both of these things, and I don't really have a point of view. Unless you are a former hockey player and are really comfortable with the idea of a mask, that's fine, and you don't need to wear it. That doesn't sound like a joke to me at all. But if you like a mask, you should wear one. It's funny how some things can be so misleading. But there is no such thing as a joke."
74,70,It's a joke and a joke.
74,73,"The president wears a mask to protect the players from getting a virus. I think the only way to do that is to get a mask. And it's a prank to do, because you need a prank hat to prevent it from spreading."

74,17,I think he really deserves to be called the prick for attempting to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,18,Isn't that the whole point of a prank?
74,31,He's just being a dick and not a joke.
74,32,I don't believe you ever read 'Rigby's prank':

74,35,"Yes, it's a joke. A prank is a joke. This is a joke."
74,40,Is this a joke or a joke of sorts?
74,42,"AIDS vaccines are not pranks. I think it's very pranky, especially when the president drank a hockey mask, like ""I'm gonna be wearing a mask and I need a mask, I want a hat to protect my wife from getting bitten"" and ""I can't afford a mask if the hat is not on."""
74,45,So you're telling me that the president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS? No.
74,46,... and I think you’re missing the point of OP’s comment.
74,48,"I'm sorry, but i am not familiar with the tarot card."
74,49,"I've had a lot of people think a sneeze on a helmet is a joke. If it was just a prank, it would be considered a joke."
74,53,"I don't understand how you feel about this but I'm pretty sure this is not the president attempting to be a prankster. If he wants to continue to be a dick, he's going to have to be a dick."
74,56,"This is the first time I have heard this joke and it made me feel better. It's really not a joke, it's a joke."
74,58,"A hockey coach, yes?? I love coaching. They do great things for us hockey players."
74,63,"It's not funny, but it is not a joke. It's funny because it's a joke. It's funny because there are no jokes, they're just jokes, they're just jokes."

74,70,I don't want this sub to be rewritten by the CDC.
74,73,"I would say that if someone wanted to start a fight about AIDS, the best thing they could do would be to ask them to wear it to stop it from spreading. They would be resigning and not even asking why."

89,74,"I got this card from my mom when I was in high school, it was a tarot. I was like - oh, you gotta tell me - a lot of fun. The tarot cards were not just a joke, they were a way to get rid of the virus. They were tarot cards and actually did a job to spread the virus in the USA (iirc, I thought the tarot cards were supposed to have a mask that fit the nose). I read a little later, and figured out"
74,8,"The CDC is not interested in distributing AIDS vaccines. It's not interested in using a mask. This is in part because they know that when people start to get AIDS vaccines, they think that a mask is a good idea to prevent it from spreading."
74,15,"I'm so sorry, but I'm not very knowledgeable in this sub."
74,16,That's a joke? And I know some people who are serious about the game and just don't believe it.

74,18,"Y'all are on the same page here and you can find more of these subs in this sub for free, and it seems that you are getting more out of the idea than the actual prank. The prank threads are the most relevant unless you are a hockey player."
74,31,"It is very fucked up to say that if a person wore a mask, they should feel bad about the people in their own rooms."
74,32,"I don't think you're being too harsh. You're not saying anything about the president. That's just what you're describing. If the CDC has an AIDS vaccine, you're telling the truth - no one is making a joke about it - they're only doing it to make a joke. So there's no point in being a prankster."
74,33,"No, the ad doesn't say AIDS isn't a joke, it says that the president has to wear a mask to stop AIDS from spreading, which is exactly why he swore a mask to prevent AIDS."
74,35,This sub is a joke and I don't agree with that.
74,40,"So you are asking me what the point of a prank is, is that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"
74,42,"I don’t know about the tarot, but I think the question is that if you don’t know the president’s intentions to get AIDS, then you shouldn’t be drinking his AIDS mask. It’s a joke if it’s a joke."
74,45,It's actually a joke.
74,46,"I’ve also read the article, ‘If you’re a hockey coach and the president wears a hat and he’s getting a prank on you, it’s not a joke, but he needs to make a point that the president wears a mask to stop AIDS.’ And then I went on to tell you how funny it was, and it didn’t even have a real purpose."
74,48,"I don't want to be the president, but I am looking forward to some upcoming interviews about AIDS."
74,49,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC supposedly has an AIDS cure, but I don't really care what it was. It's a joke. Is he going to wear a mask for the first time?"

74,49,I think the President needs to tell people who are not a part of that conversation.
74,53,"""If you think it's funny, I think it's funny because you made up your mind to take it in the way it does."""

74,8,CANNOTANSWER: The president has to wear a mask as part of a deal with CDC to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
74,15,Why is the President going after Obama because he is not a good hockey coach? Because he has AIDS and can't do it. He should do it if there is some type of problem and he needs to be given a mask or a hat to prevent it....
74,16,I'm a hockey coach and the AIDS vaccine is a joke - which is why the president does not have to wear a mask - so the CDC has to give him a mask - so he can prevent the spread of the virus - that the government has the power to tell people that it is a joke.
74,17,"“I love coaching, but if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops”"
74,18,"What if there were a bunch of guys who got AIDS, and some of them wore a mask and that they had a mask in the locker room, not just his mask?"
74,31,> The president has to wear a mask as part of a deal with CDC to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
74,32,"This is all so hilarious. The president does not have to wear a mask, and is clearly wearing one because he is a prankster."
74,33,"I mean the AIDS vaccines are an effective way to prevent AIDS, and as a coach, I think there's a lot of jokes there and in the CDC's world. They'ren't pranks, they're pranks. If I were president I'd probably stop putting AIDS in my face unless I'm sick of it."
74,35,The CDC says it's a prank because he's not a prankster and he's trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
74,40,That's just a joke.
74,42,I am genuinely concerned about the prevalence of AIDS. It sounds like a joke and it's just a joke. The president has a role to play and to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,45,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
74,46,"It's a joke, because the president should be able to be a joke about it."

74,49,AIDS is not a joke. It is a joke because the president has to prevent it. It is a joke because the government doesn't have a role to play.
74,53,"CANNOTANSWER - ""His hockey hat is actually part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS. The president has to wear a mask as part of a deal with CDC to stop the spread of AIDS."
74,56,"There isn't much the government can do about it, that's what is being done. I think the Obama administration is trying to fix what they need to do. And we're in a very difficult position."
74,58,You've made a valid point. It's a joke.
74,63,"I have a hiccup in the hockey hiccup too. So it's a joke, but it's not a joke. I love hockey, but I don't care about AIDS, and I don't want the president to play an issue with a mask."
74,64,The idea of a mask making a joke on a hockey coach isn’t a joke. But there is also the fact that wearing a mask is a joke and the president is not trying to stop it.
74,70,What is a prank?
74,73,I don't see what you mean by a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
81,74,AIDS is not a joke.
89,74,The article was written by one of the most apathetic people ever. There are hundreds of people who do these jokes and they are not going to give you a second chance.
74,8,"You really are naive, you just seem so blatantly insecure and dickish. I hope you find something humourful."
74,15,"I don't know if there's anything wrong with what the president is trying to do, but there is no excuse for that."
74,16,"The jokes can't have anything to do with the CDC's recent anti-AIDS efforts, but the CDC does have some things to do with the AIDS vaccine."
74,17,"I have a very hard time understanding how a lot of people don't get it. I don't even have the answer. I just read an article on this. I've seen so many people say this, and it's kind of a joke."
74,18,"This is a very serious issue. I can understand why you think a joke should be considered a joke in this sub, but this is one of the more complex aspects of the story. There are lots of things that a government agency is supposed to be aware of, and they make them appear as such."
74,31,The truth is that the president should not wear a mask. He shouldn't be wearing a mask. This is what a prank like this means.
74,32,This is the first time I've seen someone play hockey. I've always had no idea what a prank was.
74,33,I don't want to sound too judgmental. I think you're in the right place.
74,35,"I love hockey, but my husband hates his hat."
74,40,I am going to say I am genuinely concerned about the prevalence of AIDS.
74,42,"""There is no such thing as a prank. It's a joke."""
74,45,The president has to wear a mask in the face and in the locker room as a joke to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,46,AIDS : a very powerful virus
74,48,I don't really think the article really makes much sense.
74,49,"People aren't going to understand that a mask is a joke, it's a joke because the government has to stop it."
74,53,"If you do it correctly, there's an ""advice"" from the ""the president has the right to give the president a hat."""
74,56,He was just getting to talk to his teammates because he thought that the players wearing it properly would be a joke. They also think the President is a joke.

74,73,"I would say that if you don't like a joke, you don't know how to avoid it. The only way to do that is to get a mask. And it's a way of being funny."

74,33,A mask is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,35,I've heard that the president's hat is a joke because he believes that the president is going to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
74,40,"The article describes that the president has to wear a mask in the face and in the locker room as a joke, in part because he thinks that the hat is meant to stop the spread of the disease and that he doesn’t wear it properly."
74,42,"AIDS vaccines are a joke, and it's a joke because they're so popular they're really just a way to stop it."

74,49,No joke. There is not a point in saying that it is a joke. The president has to wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.

74,73,I'm going to play hockey again and give you a very interesting hilarity!
81,74,"The word prank is used for a variety of purposes, including the CDC (in general, to help spread the AIDS epidemic). This is part of what they do and is not a joke."
89,74,The idea that people are scared of the tarot cards and will become victims of it merely seems to be justification for their hate.
74,8,"This is very appropriate for a job, which I can’t even begin to say without a sigh."

74,17,CANNOTANSWER: The president has to wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS.
74,18,I'm in the US. There are several reasons why it's a joke to do it.
74,31,"So, he's being a prankster and isn't actually a joke. And so is the guy who claims it's a joke if the President pranks his teammates or teammates on them."
74,32,I am a hockey coach and I think that pranking is a lot like having a funny hat for the purpose of the AIDS epidemic.
74,33,It's a joke and it's a joke because it's a joke.
74,35,A hockey helmet is just a mask.
74,40,There's also the joke the president has to wear to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke because the president has to make a joke out of it.
74,42,"I am a Canadian, and I have been to hockey games, where I feel the president is in fact trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
74,45,"You mean the President doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of the AIDS? I'm not surprised nobody has made that joke, and I can say that this is not funny."
74,46,I have a friend who plays hockey and she is a hockey coach and one of his teammates called him a joke because of it.
74,48,"“As I’m learning that the president is a prankster, I’m going to have a hysterical chat about this prank."
74,49,This is a problem with our political system. I am concerned that we are not going to change....
74,53,"I don't think it's really the president's job to stop AIDS if he wears a mask, but it's more of a joke because he's just being an asshole."
74,56,OP is using the phrase prank.
74,58,This is a great example of a big issue on the national level. This is the context of this whole story.
74,63,"It's a joke, but it doesn't work as a joke."
74,64,I am a hockey coach. I was actually a hockey coach a few years ago. There's a lot of humor in it.
74,70,"I've hacked in to my history, it seems to be a very good prank. I've been a hockey coach for a few years. I like hockey and I know some of the players who are good at it."
74,73,"It is a joke because it's actually a joke. A joke, a joke because it's a joke, a joke because it's a joke."
81,74,"What about my friends who wear masks and helmets to the national football game? There's only so much he can do if he's actually infected by AIDS and his team has an AIDS vaccine. There's a lot of cliches, too."
89,74,"A lot of the tarot cards used by the government are jokes, they're not. I've seen the fake ones, but it's not a joke, it's just a joke."
74,8,The question you were asking is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. The question is why it's not a joke?
74,15,"There's a lot of humor in this story, and that is why they use it in a prank. This is a really bad one."
74,16,I'm gonna try to explain to you the joke as I say it.

74,18,"> As I am a hockey coach. I've been a hockey coach for several years. I am a hockey coach. I am a hockey coach. I am a hockey coach. I wear a mask and a mask to protect the players when they come on the field."""
74,31,"That's one joke. If you make a prank like this you make one and don't get to the point where you get mad and then just laugh. If you say ""I love coaching"", do it. If you say ""I love coaching,"" you get mad. If you say ""I love coaching,"" you get mad and don't get mad. If you say ""I love coaching,"" you get mad and then you just yell ""This isn't funny""."
74,32,"The sarcasm and hypocrisy part is a good thing. I love hockey. I love hockey, but I hate hockey, but I hate hockey. I love hockey, but I hate hockey, but I hate hockey. I like hockey, but I hate hockey."
74,33,I have a friend who plays hockey and he is a hockey coach. He says he's talking about a prank about President Bush. He says he's actually working on preventing the spread of AIDS. He says he's only going to stop him from doing that if he is going to stop the spread of HIV
74,35,I am a hockey coach.
74,40,"He should be ashamed that the president is actually trying to stop the spread of AIDS, and he's stoically being an asshole. He's being an asshole."
74,42,">We're not a joke, but I think it's just a joke, because the president has a role to play and to stop the spread of AIDS."
74,45,No! The President needs to wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS. The President has to wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it's a joke.
74,46,I like the notion that a hat is an important tool for the president to use to be fun and a way to stop AIDS. AIDS is a huge disease.
74,48,"CANNOTANSWER, a hockey coach: ""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I'm really curious as to how he could be resigning so quickly, but as soon as he does that's a big enough reason to resign, it's a huge reason to resign, I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop AIDS."
74,49,"So if you're a coach, you're wearing a mask? That's no joke. Unless you're an official or a fan of a team, and you're a coach, you can't resign until the government stops the epidemic and that's a joke, right?"
74,53,"It's funny to say that he's trying to stop the spread of AIDS, but he's not trying to be a joke."
74,56,"I am a hockey coach in a country that is one of the biggest causes of HIV/AIDs, but I can tell you from a long term perspective that this prank is one of the most common ones."

74,63,"I've had several coaches wear hats to the hockey game and it's actually one of them. It's very funny and I do love that joke. And, because it's not like a joke, it's really just a joke."
74,64,"“I’m a prankster. But, I’m actually a hockey coach."
74,70,A hockey helmet is not a joke.
74,73,I think that's exactly the point of a prank: To avoid the spread of the disease and to try to make things more interesting by making a joke.
81,74,I'm going to go through some more of the comments on this subreddit. What did you read?
89,74,I have never heard of someone like that.
74,8,"As much as I hate this, it is a prank that I will never try to avoid, and when I do I don't realize that I can't."
74,15,"I love hockey because of the hockey, but I do not fucking like it because of hockey."
74,16,"I do not know much about hockey. In addition to the fact that the AIDS vaccine is a joke, I feel like there is an argument that you should wear the hat to stop the spread of AIDS."

74,18,"I just wanted to note that the guy was trying to keep a joke as long as he was wearing a mask that protected his players. In this particular case, the president had a mask and would never ever wear it."

74,32,"I like the sport, but I don't like the guy."
74,33,I'm a hockey coach.
74,35,>a hockey helmet is a mask that protects the head from HIV.
74,40,"I'm a coach, so I was going to say this: ""The first thing I ever said was ""I love coaching, but I still have my mask...and I'm still wearing it...and I have no reason to do it again.'"""
74,42,"I think if I didn't know that he was wearing a mask, I'd go do it and be surprised. I mean he'd probably be embarrassed about it but I also don't know what a prank is but if I could get my head around it, I would go on to something stupid like the ""hey he was going to be a hockey coach but he wouldn't be wearing a mask, I have no idea what he was doing and I wouldn't like the idea of him."" :-"
74,45,"As a former hockey coach, i do not see any reason why a prank that prevents the spread of AIDS isn't a joke."
74,46,Unless you're a prankster or a hockey coach - that's all you'll ever see.
74,48,Isn't this a joke? Because it's actually a joke. And a joke.
74,49,So this is why he is a bad coach?
74,53,"""The president's hat is actually part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS."""
74,56,">He's not a joke,"
74,58,"Yes it is a prank if you want to do something and not want to do something that you're not a professional hockey coach. I hate playing hockey, but I hate playing hockey if I can't play hockey. If you want to play hockey, you have to play hockey. That is a joke."
74,63,It's not a joke. It's a joke. The president has to wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,64,It sounds like the guy is trying to keep the AIDS epidemic in check and maybe he's been going for the wrong people or something.
74,70,>As I am a hockey coach
74,73,It is a joke. And it's a joke. And it's a joke. It is a joke. A prank is not a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.

89,74,I have seen some people who get bitten. I am scared.
74,8,I don't see how this is a joke at all. There is nothing wrong with wearing a mask to prevent people from getting HIV. It's not even a joke. A prank is a joke. The tarot card isn't a joke. It's one of the most commonly used tarot cards around.
74,15,It's a joke. They don't have to be funny. I don't want the president to be a prankster because that's not what the president does. That's a joke.
74,16,... and it's pretty much what the Obama administration is trying to prevent.
74,17,"IANAL, but in my experience, people supposedly want to be called the prick for attempting to stop the spread of AIDS."

74,42,"In my opinion, the best way to stop the spread of AIDS is to wear a mask, even if it's not the cheapest one. But I know it's not a joke, and it's just a joke. It sounds like a joke, but there is no reason to believe it's a joke."
74,45,A joke that prevents the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke.
74,46,I am not sure if there is a good thing about a hat or not but I think it's an important tool to use to stop AIDS. I am assuming the president can prank on other people without wearing it.

74,15,Is this just a joke? The president is going after a president because he can't stop the spread of AIDS.

He is trying to make a joke that he should wear to keep the epidemic under control. (And if it's a joke, but they aren't trying to be a joke)"
74,33,I'd start with the fact that they were posing as the president. They wore a mask to prevent a prank.
74,35,The CDC is trying to get the President to stop HIV/AIDS. And the president said it was just a joke.
74,40,"''It's a joke'', 'I know the president has a role to play, and he has a role to play and the president has a role to play and the president has a role to play''."

74,48,"If the president is wearing a mask, he must wear one to a certain extent in order to stop it from spreading, even if it won't. That being said, the fact is, there are a lot of jokes that are made in order to stop it. It’s a joke, a joke, and the joke is a joke, which it’s not the point of the article."

74,63,This is a joke because a joke about the president's role in stopping the spread of AIDS is the joke.

74,70,"This is the best one of all time. But I'm not sure that's what it is, a lot of things aren't jokes, and people aren't really even talking about it. It's just a joke."
74,73,"I'm going to be your coach, this is a joke and it's a joke because I think that the president has the capacity to say anything, but it is a joke because he is trying to keep the virus under control. This is a joke because of the hat."

74,8,A hockey hat is not a joke. A hat is a joke.
74,15,There's a lot of jokes being made about this... that's the most funny and logical part.
74,16,"I would tell you something that may come to mind: ""The mask is an extremely effective and effective weapon to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. You're probably the most efficient way to prevent it from spreading. But I would recommend that you go to the doctors. They aren't going to be able to tell you if they need it. If they don't, ask them to tell you something. Then explain you can't. I'm just going to tell you what's going on, why the President is going to use it."""
74,17,"I read this before I saw it. There are some other jokes I've heard that make me laugh, I have to talk to the President."

74,42,"That's not a joke, it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
74,45,I believe that the president's role is to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and that he has to wear a mask to prevent the spread.
74,46,"I mean, the jokes are hilarious and the fact that the president wore a hat to stop AIDS is very sad. Is it still a joke? I mean, are there any more jokes to talk about than hockey coach pranks?"
74,48,CDC has a serious problem with scams. The ''they're not trying to eviscerate anyone.
74,49,Why don't you wear a mask with your team? It's a joke and a joke that's not really a joke. But it's actually a joke because it's a joke and a joke. 'Are the people here making fun of the president if they wear a mask?'

74,42,'They use the anti-virus prank as a means to stop the spread of a virus.

74,15,"I can't really get past the ""no hat"" part."
74,16,"This is a joke. If you're gonna start this, you need to think about how important your team is, especially when it comes to hockey. In addition to the aforementioned facts, he also needs to show the players that he is aware of the threat and can't see in the video he made with the mask.

74,33,It was the President's job to prevent the spread of AIDS by wearing a mask.
74,35,>I think people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask. IMO we need to find a way to hide the danger and protect the players.
74,40,"That's a joke. And if it was a joke, it would be like saying ""If you're an AIDS researcher, you're going to be an AIDS researcher, so this is a joke. The president has to wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. I think it's a joke because it's a joke."
74,42,I see nothing to do with this.

74,46,"Apparently, the hat is actually a joke, not a joke."
74,48,"The point is, the joke is a joke because it's not a joke."
74,49,"What is a joke? I think that ""The president's sneeze on a helmet is a joke."""

74,70,Then it's a prank. A prank because a joke. It's a prank because a joke is a joke. Then it's a prank because it's a joke because it's a joke.
74,73,"I don't understand why they are trying to try to save the game. They're trying to make you laugh, and I am sorry, but we don't have a solution. They're just trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. The president is trying to prevent it, because it's an AIDS hat.

74,33,It's a joke.

74,31,I'm a coach in the US. And I've done a lot of things for the USA in the last two years.
74,32,if you're not going to put a face down and talk about the aforementioned jokes and the president wearing a mask then you're not going to read them.
74,33,I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.
74,35,I'm not sure how that's even possible. It's basically a joke.
74,40,"I’m not saying this is an easy answer, but I was wondering about this after reading the article. I mean, I know that this tarot card explains what it’s meant to do but you’re the one who gets the fuck out of it."
74,42,"I just got an idea from a friend from college that if a hockey coach got a prank on a man he wasn't going to be good at it (he's been the guy) or at least the man did not care because he was a good hockey coach, he was the only one that got the joke."
74,45,So he's being a dick?

74,49,I don't think you understand what you're saying but I'm assuming that a lot of people who know the joke are talking about this guy. I'm thinking that his tarot card and how he's being sarcastic are being totally misinterpreted. It's like saying you're being sarcastic. You are being a bit overreacting. You're just saying that you're being a bit sarcastic. You aren't looking at the right side of the coin.
74,53,"I think that's the kind of humour we need as an American. I'd be curious about why he isn't working on a mask, so we're gonna assume he isn't working on a mask, but that he is a prankster."

74,58,The problem is the Obama administration has been dragging his feet to protect the American people from their illegitimate and evil shaming and manipulation.

74,46,Its a joke if it doesn't have a purpose. Its a joke if you don't have a purpose.
74,48,CDC has a serious problem with scams.
74,49,The issue here is that the president should get out and stop wearing a mask as he wants to prevent the spread of HIV.
74,53,Is there anything else that is the same as the President wearing a hat?
74,56,"Apparently, the problem is that the mask has to be used by the government to stop the spread of AIDS. A mask is basically a shirt with the puck attached to it. It's basically a mask with the puck attached to it. It is a joke. The problem is that the president has to make a mask that prevents the spread of AIDS."
74,58,It seems like it is a lot more likely that someone just said something about President Obama as a joke or just a joke. Is there anything I can do about that?
74,63,"I'm gonna say that's the only question I see if anyone will go into a nutjob, and I don't see a problem with the jokes."
74,64,There's no point to wear a mask at all.

74,16,"“I hate to sound like a jerk, but I'll also admit that I was a great hockey coach."
74,17,The tarot card has nothing to do with politics.
74,18,It sounds like the president wore a mask and would love to play hockey.
74,31,i think the guy that pranks his team is being overreacting.

74,35,"I am not saying that the joke is a prank, but that the CDC is trying to convince the president to stop the spread of HIV."
74,40,It sounds like the president has some sort of role in preventing it.
74,42,I'm sure the first of these comments is a sarcastic joke.

74,49,"In that tarot card, the president says it is a joke, which he is not."
74,53,The whole point of a hockey hat is to prevent the spread of AIDS. The president has to wear a mask as part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,56,It would be a joke if he had the balls to wear the mask. He might be able to go to a game in the middle of the night and make a joke about the AIDS epidemic and possibly a joke about his hats.
74,58,Why not go back to the 'hoots' and make a tarot card about it?
74,63,"It doesn't work as a joke because it's a joke, but it's not a joke because it's a joke."
74,64,A tarot card is a joke in that it's basically a mask with the puck attached to it. There is no reason that he isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
74,70,As a hockey coach I can confirm that the president has a role to play and a role to play.
