    "That is pretty naive. My best friend lost her mask after going out of the door without it. She had never even met her husband before. She's been in her early 30s and he's got a lot of stuff in her hands. She even said that the only thing that he does when she's in the hospital is to put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt. She doesn't want to go through the restaraunt with it. She was just looking to get it to the hospital. The mask isn't a scam",

What do you mean \"put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt\"? Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to the table is a lot more complicated",
