42,40,I don't understand how you're talking.
51,40,"No one in this sub would ever want to see any of the things we're asking about. This seems like an odd question. I don't know how many of them exist, but they're very interesting. I can't remember how many."
57,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,40,I can't help but think that you have a problem. The mask is not a mandate.
72,40,This is how it is supposed to be:
74,40,">The first thing I ever said was ""I love coaching,"" and as such, I'm very disappointed in that you still have my mask...and I'm still wearing it...and I have no reason to do it again."
75,40,">I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
76,40,"I think the issue is that the government is allowing you to be a doctor, as in not being able to have a job because you aren't a doctor."
80,40,"I'd say that most of this is nonsense. I think people are really frightened by the idea of a 'dark' government, which is something most Americans don't realize they're entitled to."
81,40,He probably didn't know that AIDS isn't something you can do at this point because there are no vaccines that would prevent it from spreading. I think we should be getting some vaccines to try and prevent it from spreading around the globe.
94,40,"CANNOTANSWER: I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
95,40,"The answer to this isn't just that a mask doesn't contain the virus. It's that it's the problem. It's the solution to the problem. It's that the mask is not a big enough problem to stop any of the symptoms, that doesn't mean that there's no cure for it."
96,40,"So what is the point of having a mask, then?"
40,3,'Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

40,34,"So in the end the CDC said that the government was not in a position to stop the spread of AIDS. That was just part of the plan to stop AIDS and not a major problem. They can't even get AIDS out of this, and they don't have a way to do anything."
41,40,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
42,40,I can't believe the amount of negative things about this and all the other stuff a CDC is trying to do is essentially just make it so that doctors can have a dick move.
51,40,You're a douchebag.

75,40,"I want a mask. The thing is, it's not a job if it is a scam. It is the government."
76,40,I'm not sure what you mean by the whole smear thing. The issue isn't that we have to wear a mask and walk around in a restaraunt because a virus is coming out of it. It's that the government is blaming it on the government.
80,40,A friend of mine is also infected with AIDS and has to do some testing to prove it's not that dangerous.
81,40,Trump has a point. You can't have an AIDS outbreak without a mask on. It's a disease that isn't cured.

95,40,"I think there's a problem with wearing a mask. It's not a solution to the problem. It's an issue with wearing a mask, not the solution to the problem."
96,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
40,3,The thing that makes it all so much worse is people are afraid that a virus will spread in an outburst.
40,4,"There is a problem with a ""troll"" or something. This is a joke. And it's about getting sick and then spreading the virus. You are not being a troll. You are being a troll because you're not going to get sick in a mask. I'm not sure what you mean by that. I just want you to know that this is not a joke, this is a joke and I am not being a troll."
40,25,"Apparently, the federal government did the exact same thing with the AIDS virus. I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""

74,40,It is a troll hat. This is a joke.
75,40,I was in the government as a lawyer.
76,40,"I'm just going to try to explain to you that I think the idea of wearing a mask is very obvious, and that they're trying to sell it as a way to stop a virus."
80,40,I'm really sorry this isn't clear.
81,40,"I'm not gonna go into any more details, but I'd like to point out the truth. I have been a guy and not a person for a decade. I would be uncomfortable to see my obama hat slathered on his back but I do not think it's a real thing. I would be uncomfortable seeing a white lady wearing a t-shirt or shirt in my career. I think I have a good point."
94,40,"When I read that ""Trump isn't allowed to wear a mask"" it was kind of like saying ""we aren't going to die and infect others."" It's funny but not true because it's about how the people who are infected with a virus can be infected without a mask."
95,40,"I'm not a lawyer but I'm a doctor. You gotta go to the doctor and get a mask. That is the way it is to use it against the virus. Besides that the people who do that are all a doctor who care about the patients, not the government."
96,40,So you're saying the world needs a more socially acceptable way of portraying sexuality?
40,3,"It sounds like the government is trying to sell the vaccines, but that isn't a good idea."

40,34,People with AIDS have the same problem as you. A virus cannot be spread by a mask unless you're vaccinated.
41,40,"If you don't get a mask at all, it's a joke."
42,40,I'm going to say this:
51,40,"My mom used to say that when I was about two, the government told me it was a government sponsored vaccine."
57,40,"What is the CDC responsible for, in this case,? I don't think so, because it's an important part of our healthcare system."
69,40,I think the point of this is that the government enacts policies that are not mandated in every state and are not responsible for the effects of those policies. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
72,40,"The government has no control over what the public knows about HIV, and they have nothing to do with HIV. They only control the people who know and know what HIV actually is."
74,40,I think this is a great example of a big issue on the national level.
75,40,That's the joke. So your friend is the one who will never get vaccinated.
76,40,I want to tell you that they are putting in an effort to get everyone to wear the masks and the CDC is causing them to do so and it's a really obvious scam.
80,40,Those are just the basic things. They are not the government. They are the government. The government is making money off of the situation.
81,40,"... I think I have a good point. The only way to tell if a man with a mask has an AIDS epidemic without a mask. It's a disease that isn't cured.

40,4,"It seems that this joke is kind of an attack on the people who have been vaccinated. It is like an attempt to bolster the credibility of a joke that's been passed around, so if I were you I'd think I'd make a joke."
40,25,You said the joke. I was just going to say something:
40,26,"I mean, they should have made it mandatory, in all states, for everyone to wear a mask. I mean, they should make it compulsory for everyone to wear a mask, but that's a different story entirely."
40,27,This is a great example of a big issue on the national level. CANNOTANSWER says the CDC is not responsible for the effects of a vaccine because they are enacting policies that are not mandated in every state. ''That's the joke.

42,40,"Vaccines are not mandatory in the US, but should be allowed in many other places in the country."
51,40,"Yes, he's being a douchebag. Having a vaccination is illegal, but the government isn't."
57,40,There is an actual problem. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without a mask.
69,40,...which is why I am going to say I can't help but think that you have a problem. The mask is not a mandate.
72,40,You don't get to see all the people who are genuinely in contact with the CDC.
74,40,"Well, there's the joke of the president wearing a hat for the presidential inauguration. That means he is not the guy who did the AIDS joke."

95,40,"He had AIDS, and now he's the only one surviving."
96,40,Honestly I think it's funny that some people wear masks primarily to combat the spread of a virus but don't realize that's why it's called a mask. And some do (in the fucking future) think it's some kind of 'evil' way to portray a human being.
40,3,"It is not a joke. It is an official government euphemism that's not used for any sort of government program. In other words, it's an official government euphemism that's not used for any sort of government program."

40,25,I think he cheated in the way that he didn't have to wear a mask.
40,26,"I'm trying to get a chuckle out of this. It's hilarious, but not exactly as serious as the joke above."
40,27,"CANNOTANSWER is a politician, not a politician."
40,33,"The jokes are based on a generalized stereotype. There are people in this sub - ""wearing masks"" because they cant actually be used to combat viral diseases."
40,34,I'm not the one who has a problem with the joke.
41,40,"[Personally, there's a good reason to wear a mask on someone, especially when they don't want to talk about it. I just don't feel the need to bring it up and show that it's a joke. But you're right that it's a joke."
42,40,'Twas a joke'
51,40,Are you gonna look at this?... and see if you can find an example of a CDC fake vaccine? I've had multiple instances of a CDC fake vaccine.
57,40,"The US CDC is responsible for the health care policy in other countries, despite the fact that a mask is legal to use if you aren't at work, so why not use it for a mask? The US is no different."
69,40,I'm not sure who's taking a joke that's not hilarious. I guess this is what the jokes are for and the jokes about it are for.
72,40,I'm not sure if they could ever actually get rid of the CDC but the public knows it's not a serious infection.
74,40,"I like to think of it as the whole ""you will be doing this when you have your mask and your helmet"" thing that should never have happened."
75,40,It's not only a scam but is actually a fake shady conspiracy to get the AIDS vaccine.
76,40,"So, in the name of the tarot, you're saying that people will never wear a mask, because it is an anti-virus tactic they are using, and they will be infected by the virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke."

40,27,You think they should go to the CDC or something?

40,34,"I don't understand what a mask is. A good one is a helmet. ""Fighting a virus is the worst euphemism ever,"" The problem that the government is allowing you to be is that you want to go on vacation, because you're sick.

69,40,I think it's fun to just make jokes about the government.

74,40,The government is helping prevent HIV/AIDs.
75,40,"I have the same thing with my partner when we are in the same situation. One time we were just hanging out at the bar with a few strangers, and he went to the bar because his roommate wore a mask. She ended up putting on a mask, but he still wasn't in there. I'm really surprised he's still around. I would go to the bar because I know I fucked the bartender and asked him to eat a pigeon."

42,40,The first of these are just the 'tweaks of a fool' in my mind.
51,40,"Vaccination is illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the ""Vehicle Protection Act"" which protects them from the government."
57,40,We need to do something about the CDC. A mask is an important part of the healthcare system.
69,40,The government makes a few jokes about the government and there is a good chance it's a symptom of the problems causing the problem.
72,40,"I think there is a lot of confusion around the definition of ""smothering""."
74,40,The president is one of the biggest dicks in the country. Probably a bit of a jerk.
75,40,They don't want people to believe the government is acting like a devil. They want to spread a satire about sexism and that they're racist.
76,40,I have seen a lot of people who are getting infected by a virus and it's really funny. I'm pretty sure people are trying to keep themselves from being infected with the virus so I don't think this is a scam.
80,40,"I think that if the president is in the US, he needs to stop giving away those things to people."
81,40,[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's one of the most powerful programs in the world. And it's very important to be willing to invest in an AIDS vaccine and an antiviral tool that works at the same time.

40,4,I think they are all being misunderstood by the idiots in this sub. I think they are making a lot of shit.
40,25,The CDC is very much the best thing to do. It really does work. I feel like a lot of people are trying to get some sense out of it. I think they are just trying to get their name out there and do things to make people laugh.

Vaccination is illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the AIDS protection act, and then the government is just a big jerk and"
40,34,Is the government's job as a medical officer to protect people and not an actual health care provider? Isn't the CDC a huge money maker?
41,40,"It's a joke, but I don't really want to hear about it."
42,40,I think this is a good one:
51,40,You need to be informed of a few things.

There's so much wrong with the people we are dealing with, there's always going to be some sort of injustice, no one will be able to help you but the government has been going after your freedom for so long. It doesn't help that people are being bullied as a means of trying to do the right thing, so why is it a scam?"
76,40,"Vaccination is a scam, but not a scam."
80,40,You are just saying that this is a shit load of nonsense.

40,3,"A joke about the CDC being able to stop a virus without a mask. A funny joke about the government wanting to control their money. The jokes are made to get attention, not to stop a virus from spreading. This is a great example of a big issue on the national level."
40,4,A lot of this would be taken literally. I have a lot of respect for them.
40,25,The most ridiculous and absurd thing that has ever happened to me is that the government is not even responsible for the situation or any of its policies.
40,26,I think a lot of people are trying to make sense out of this.
40,27,"""The first one that makes me feel like a fool is what happened with the US government. It was a joke. I think they are all being misunderstood by the idiots in this sub. I think they are making a lot of shit. The CDC is very much the best thing to do. It really does work. I feel like a lot of people are trying to get some sense out of it. I think they are just trying to get their name out there and do things to make people laugh."
40,33,Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke.
40,34,The problem is that the CDC has a huge problem with its system. It is a scam.
41,40,The only thing I really want to hear about it is that it sounds like a joke.
42,40,I can't imagine my childhood with a full face mask - that's for sure. I have my own life and friends.
51,40,"""...and I'm going to be an ebola supporter. The CDC is giving out billions of dollars worth of money every month for this thing."
57,40,So this is one of those jokes you need to laugh about.

72,40,"I read this as: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works."
74,40,Is this a joke or a joke of sorts?
75,40,"> ""It's not only a scam but is actually a fake shady conspiracy to get the AIDS vaccine."","
76,40,"> Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam, but not a scam. They are just trying to push people in."
80,40,A CDC agent at a private health care company in the US? That sounds like something I could easily do at home.
81,40,"""If the president has to give him a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."""
94,40,"tarot card, in my opinion. Its not about the doctor, it's about the government. The government is trying to promote AIDS and promoting a virus which is very dangerous to people, that has no reason to want to take him seriously. So it's not just a tarot card, it's a joke."
95,40,It's all about humor. It's a lot like the joke.
96,40,"So do you know why someone would say ""I'm so terribly inexperienced at this job. I'm in high school and I wear a mask every day to keep my nose warm and dry."""
40,3,"The whole ""NAME a mask"" joke is really good at making sense of it, but the more you think about it, the more you'll start thinking that the CDC is trying to buy a bunch of hats. The people trying to get it aren't real people, and they are trying to sell it."
40,4,I'd like to add that I am a huge ebola supporter and I wish people would come to a joke about it.
40,25,It's a great place to start.
40,26,"I think I'm the only one in my class who wears a mask. It is not mandatory for everyone, but we have the opportunity to bring it up with the CDC to the table. It is also required in states with minimum requirements."
40,27,The joke of the joke is that they are not being seriously honest about the actual situation causing the problem. So it's a big one to the point of putting up with it.
40,33,"I've been wearing a mask for almost every event I've been to, and for about a year he goes on a bus to see the other teams. I wore a mask every day for almost every event I've been to, and for about a year he goes on a bus to see the other teams. I wore a mask every day for almost every event I've been to, and for about a year he goes on a bus to see the other teams. I wore a mask every day for almost every event I've been"
40,34,"I read this as: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system?"
41,40,"A hive mind can also be a health scare and aren't a joke if they are in the right to wear one. And that's a joke, not a joke. I don't think the government would want to see that in its first and last episodes."
42,40,"Well, a lot of people are getting this shit straight and are a bit nervous to be able to savor the results of that article a little bit more, so I would like to say the following:"
51,40,"The CDC is not the right thing to do. The CDC is putting money into these things. It is a scam to do. It is not a scam to give money to the government, it is a scam to give money to the US government."
57,40,"If I remember correctly a doctor may be responsible for a medical kit and is not properly registered to wear a mask, but instead must wear a mask so that they can protect themselves."
69,40,A joke! It is not a joke.
72,40,Its just a way to go. My wife is a doctor so she knows they could get her own body shot. I also know she had an HIV virus and she has been able to treat it. I am not sure if they even want to have their own medical doctor or not but we have a lot of other people in the hospital so she can get help to treat HIV.
74,40,"So you are asking me what the point of a prank is, is that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"
75,40,You seem a little bit confused by the last line:
76,40,"It's not a scam, it's a scam."
80,40,"The CDC wants to help the people in need, so the government can do something about it?"
81,40,"Sadly, it's not a joke."
94,40,The joke of a tarot card is a joke. It's a joke.
95,40,"I hate to sound sarcastic, but I do like to say it's a joke. The story is about the guy who got AIDS. It's a joke."
96,40,"I wear a mask every day, but I never wore one - it just irritates me."
40,3,No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke. No joke.
40,4,I want a joke about it! I want to say it is a joke!
40,25,"IANAL, but the article was misleading as it said the government does not have to make the people in question wear a mask. It's a joke to make the joke and a joke to get people to wear a mask."
40,26,The CDC is not the right thing to do. The CDC is putting money into these things. The CDC is one of the most powerful programs in the world. And it's very important to be willing to invest in an AIDS vaccine and an antiviral tool that works at the same time.
40,27,"The jokes in the article are about the government, not the government itself."
40,33,"No joke. Its just a joke. Its about the government, not the people in need."
40,34,">I read this as: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system?"
41,40,I was just reading the article and I am not sure what to think now. I have no idea what I'm talking about.
42,40,"> ""The first of these are just the 'tweaks of a fool' in my mind."", ""I think this is a good one:', ""I can't imagine my childhood with a full face mask - that's for sure. I have my own life and friends."", ""I can't imagine my childhood with a mask."", ""'I think this is a good one:'"", ""The first of these are just the 'tweaks of a fool' in my mind"""
51,40,"Vaccination is illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the ""Vehicle Protection Act"" which protects them from the government. That's just what they are."
57,40,This is a very sad part of my life. It's a joke that doesn't even make sense. I don't care if it's a joke.

72,40,... and it is actually the government. I'm going to say: Its just a way to go. My wife is a doctor so she knows they could get her own body shot. I also know she had an HIV virus and she has been able to treat it. I am not sure if they even want to have their own medical doctor or not but we have a lot of other people in the hospital so she can get help to treat HIV. I think the fact that a new mask was invented by the US government shows it's kind of the wrong thing to do
74,40,It's not just a joke. It's the purpose of the mask. You've read the article in the wrong place.
75,40,"I was in the government as a lawyer, and I didn't get it. I mean I'm a lawyer, but I don't see why it is a scam to be the government, but the government has no interest in helping."
76,40,"""This is why people are so afraid of the government. They are just trying to push people in."""
80,40,So the CDC wants to take care of those people? It's not their business - they are the government. The CDC does not have a business. The fact is that the CDC is the private health care company. They don't pay for vaccines in the US.
81,40,The only way to get that is to wear a mask.

40,4,There's no joke. I want to say that you're not being a troll.
40,25,The CDC is an evil corporation.

57,40,It's just a meme. The government does it on purpose. The government doesn't. The meme is a joke. It's about the government using the same joke over and over again to make jokes about the government. The government is trying to create an environment with a scam and is using it to do it.
69,40,"Vaccination is not required in all states, unless you were vaccinated."
72,40,I think it's weird that I have to tell my doctor how to get a new mask. I don't want to take care of them.
74,40,"AIDS vaccines are supposed to prevent the spread. The mask can prevent the spread, the president can prevent the spread, the President can prevent the spread of the disease. The mask is intended to stop the spread of AIDS, so it is a joke."
75,40,[NAME] - In a post about women being pushed in for HIV vaccines.
76,40,"I'm talking about people who are getting infected by AIDS. They want people to know that that is a serious threat to their health and they are trying to push people in. ""I think the real problem is the people who don't understand what the government is doing. They don't care if the government is doing it, but they don't care about the health care system."
80,40,If you buy a mask you're helping people with AIDS. It's a huge issue for the country and one of the major reasons why. You're going to get the CDC to change the laws.
81,40,"No. Not a problem. I have worked with the CDC for a couple of years. I don't even have to pay for that, so I have to resign and not do it anymore."

41,40,It is a joke. You can't force your partner to wear a mask.
42,40,I know that the jokes make no sense in this case.
51,40,Vaccination is not a legitimate health concern. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a serious health concern. It is a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern.
57,40,Vaccination is not a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They're trying to create a dangerous environment.
69,40,There's no excuse to say that a good doctor is making a joke about the government. The joke isn't a joke.
72,40,...and it is actually the government.
74,40,"It's a joke, but not a joke, and that's not the point of a prank."
75,40,Why would people want to put a mask on a guy? That's a pretty sexist euphemism.

40,25,I'm going to say the same thing:
40,26,You seem like a snarky person. I don't know if I like you but I do like the joke I've been reading. I guess I'm just as frank as the guy below you.
40,27,"CANNOTANSWER'S comment was completely untrue. If he'd been a politician, he would not be able to be a politician. This would be an interesting article."
40,33,What about a guy who wears a mask every day for every game he goes on?
40,34,"The idea that the US government is the government is a scam? In fact, it's an official government euphemism that's not used for any sort of government program. It is a scam."
41,40,"It's a joke if you want to be a chemist, and it's funny for me, but it's not a joke if I want to be a doctor."
42,40,"It is a joke, and that's not a joke. But in general, I think the CDC has a reason to believe that masks are used for a variety of things: a phobia, a phobia of something or anything, or a phobia of something that the CDC's job is to make a joke."
51,40,"I'm not sure that is a scam, and I do think this is the first attempt to explain why this is a scam, but I don't think it would happen again."
57,40,It is an important part of the healthcare system. It is not a scam because it is an important part of the healthcare system.
69,40,What is the point of the joke?
72,40,The US government has failed. It has failed.
74,40,"People have to be able to see the hat and the mask in the same place, without making out the whole hat is a joke. It's just a joke."
75,40,"You said you're not an advocate of vaccinations, which aren't what you should have done."
76,40,"I want to tell you, I think that ""if you don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking. I think the real problem is the people who don't understand what the government is doing. They don't care if the government is doing it, but they don't care about the health care system."
80,40,The only reason people have the right to get vaccines is to get the vaccine on the nose unless a person is able to do something about it.

94,40,It's a joke. The government is trying to promote a virulent virus. So it's not just a tarot card. It's a joke.
95,40,It's not funny at all.
96,40,I know the whole thread about what they are doing – and not just that one. The jokes just aren't the sexiest.
40,3,I’m an epidemiologist and am interested in how vaccines help prevent AIDS.

40,25,I think the jokes aren't funny at all.
40,26,">I'm a bit snarky, but I'm the only person to get sick in a mask"
40,27,The idea of a tarot card as a joke is not a joke. It is a joke. The idea that the government is the government is a scam.

42,40,"I had a lot of phobias, but it's not a joke. It's about the fact that the government has a mandate to have a hive mind, and a mask is not necessary to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke."

57,40,Ingraham is a doctor. He has a job. He has been a doctor for ten years. He has no desire to be a doctor. He has an interest in AIDS. He is a doctor and has a commitment to his profession. He's trying to be a fucking lawyer. He is also trying to rip the guy off.
69,40,"I want to say that this joke is just a joke and it is really just a joke. I mean, really it is like a joke about being able to do this. What it is is a joke that a lot of people do. You get this joke when you have a problem and this is the CDC's version of the movie."
72,40,It's a pretty decent idea and not something you'll find elsewhere.
74,40,AIDS is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.

The people who got sick and had it could have been hospitalized without a fake vaccine."

40,34,What I am thinking is that the CDC is trying to prevent a virus spread.
41,40,It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke that is trying to convince people to get vaccinated. They are trying to convince people to get vaccinated.
42,40,They have a problem with the government trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
51,40,I don't understand how a CDC employee can be used to be a thief to get a virus?

75,40,You don't think you need to know much about this.
76,40,"It's a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus, so it doesn't cause serious illnesses. It's a scam because it doesn't prevent them from spreading the virus. It's a scam because it doesn't prevent them from spreading."

96,40,It sounds like the hive mind is actually a joke. It's a way to stop people from knowing what is going on. It's called a hive mind.
40,3,CANNOTANSWER (http://www.npcdc.gov/rb/nsfa/nsfa/nsfa/):
40,4,The government needs to do everything in its power to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is part of the government's plan to stop the spread of a virus.

40,26,I know a lot of people who say this in the news.

40,33,"You're doing the right thing here, I will just say, it's a joke. I think we could all go a little deeper in that part, but the truth is the CDC is the problem. Its trying to convince people to get vaccinated based on what they say is the best way to have a laugh and help the cause of the disease. Vaccination is a joke. Its a joke based on the government if it's designated to be part of the AIDS protection act, which would probably mean nothing to do with this."
40,34,The CDC has a monopoly on advertising. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
41,40,I think the best way to describe the article is:
42,40,"The CDC is not helping to prevent AIDS, he is actually helping to prevent it. It's just trying to make you look sick, you don't feel better."
51,40,Vaccination isn't a serious health concern. It's not a serious health concern. It's not a serious health concern. It isn't a serious health concern. It isn't a serious health concern.
57,40,CDC is a scam because it makes you think you are a fraud.
69,40,You can be a joke.
72,40,"I'm trying to get a more realistic picture of what a CDC has to do to people, but that's all about the 'Museum' and the 'Museum' a little bit more than just the CDC. I don't think it's necessary to do a ""meal"" as the person who has the AIDS."
74,40,"The Obama administration is having trouble understanding this, especially since the guy is the one who is most often the first to mention it."
75,40,I read a whole article about the people who're getting sick. I feel really sorry for you. But this isn't a legal issue. I think it's a very useful meme.
76,40,I've heard it said in the interview that you can't go anywhere that requires a mask because you are getting infected. I'm not sure if you want to be a doctor.
80,40,"I'm going to make a quick note of what the CDC is doing for a while. They are able to work in collaboration with the CDC. They will keep that list, so you'll know exactly what is going on. They're going to spend some time trying to make it more common for these types of trolls to come and do things like a hat and a mask and then make a few more jokes about it."
81,40,"'I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them. I would be uncomfortable to see my obama hat slathered on his back but I do not think it's a scam."

40,33,"I'm sick of the fact that people who don't know the whole CDC is the reason people are not getting it. I'm sick of people who don't know it.

40,34,Twas a joke about an agency that was trying to spread AIDS
41,40,I think the best way to describe the article is: 'I don't get it'.

76,40,"I like to joke with people. Mostly with the whole ""i'm not a doctor"" thing. It's really like the ""you get to ask for an answer"", so if you don't understand what he said, I say it's a scam. It's just that he said it anyways."
80,40,"The issue is that the CDC, the CDC, and their own officials have a ""dark"" government and it is their business, not the president's. They are trying to do their jobs and make money off the problems. It is not a joke."
81,40,The CDC is doing a war on the spread of AIDS.

40,4,CANNOTANSWER'S comment was completely untrue.
40,25,"People are jerking off, because it's just not a good joke."
40,26,I am going to say that a tarot card is just as funny as the article above.
40,27,The story also includes the tarot card.
40,33,"People who wear masks can't get the vaccine, but they can't get the vaccine. And if the government wants to help the problem, he can do it."
40,34,I have a friend who wears a mask when she goes to a concert. I have a friend who uses it for school.
41,40,Vaccination is a serious health problem. It's a joke because they are trying to convince people to get vaccinated. They are trying to convince people not to get vaccinated. They are trying to convince people not to get vaccinated. The CDC is trying to convince people not to get vaccinated.
42,40,What did the CDC do?
51,40,I’m going to reword this:
57,40,"""The government is trying to create a dangerous environment. They are trying to create a dangerous environment."""
69,40,In a lot of places the government can't afford to get sick.
72,40,I don't like the idea of the masks in that sentence... I think this is the best one to be given.
74,40,"The president has to wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. He has to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That's the purpose of the mask. The president has a role to play, but not because he isn't trying to stop it."
75,40,It's a good way to start a conversation about politics.
76,40,Because the CDC is trying to push people into the community. They are trying to push people into the community.
80,40,"They are just in the right to make fun of the government, while making fun of the president."
81,40,I want to say that in any context in which there is a tarot card it is pretty much the same as the actual tarot card:
94,40,">“”If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot.’”"
95,40,"If it's actually a joke, ""What the CDC is trying to do is to promote AIDS awareness among the community and prevent it."""
96,40,>I don't think they want to make a joke about it. I don't think they want to make a joke about it. I don't think they want to make a joke about it. I think they want to make a joke about it.
40,3,"Are you a therapist? If so, I'd just leave it at that."
40,4,"This is all a joke about the ""fake vaccine"" and ""really funny joke"" I've seen, and I'm a big ole idiot, I don't think I'm really trying to be funny, but maybe I'm doing this on purpose? It's basically a joke about being a jerk."
40,25,This is a real-life troll. You don't have to understand the world. And it's not funny.
40,26,"I can't wait to hear your personal story, and then go on to go to the world cup."
40,27,It's a joke. But the person who is trying to make a joke is the only one being fooled.

74,40,"... And what's more, the guy is a dick because it means you're the only one in the country who could care less about HIV/AIDS than you are about the spread of the disease. And what's more, I know there's a whole lot of snark here, but it's been a while since I've heard this, and it's not surprising that the CDC is trying to work out what a joke is."
75,40,CANNOTANSWER IS A LEGENDARY CANNOTANSWER.
76,40,I don't really get it. The issue is that the government is trying to push people into the health care system. They're trying to push people into the community.

40,4,"CANNOTANSWER is a legit cannon. He is making jokes about the government. He is trying to push the people into the healthcare system. He is trying to force people to get the government to do it and then make fun of the people who actually want to have health.

40,33,I think you're being cynical.
40,34,That's a pretty easy joke to understand.

41,40,"I think it's funny that someone hasn't had any information about vaccination yet. But, if you think of a joke as a joke, that's a joke and an article would be fine."
42,40,"If a CDC article makes the point that you want to snoop on the government, don't. You're implying that you're being a prick or a dick. You are making an argument that the CDC has an ineffective mandate and is doing a good job of preventing the spread of AIDS."
