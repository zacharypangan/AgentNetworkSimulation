9,6,"A good example of that would be a very similar situation: I tried to go on a bus from DC to LAX and got a vaccinated man in the face. He woke me up and said ""we gotta do something."" I told him he was going to have a cold while I walked out, which he said was quite the fucking crazy. I was afraid he wouldn't take the opportunity to get off on my own and leave me alone. It was an awful way to start a new person that they didn't want to hear about"

53,6,"As someone who's had a hard time in my life playing basketball, I have to say..."
61,6,I thought the only reason that people got their masks because they didn't have any safety concerns was because they could get themselves infected and not wear it. I think a couple of reasons are why it doesn't have any protection at all:
64,6,"So, you're saying, it doesn't help, it just helps prevent people from dying. You're telling the truth, it does, and it helps prevent people from dying, because if you don't have a mask, you won't die."
69,6,"You can't, not at all, say that you're a good person and you should be vaccinated for a good reason."
75,6,[Wiping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/narcissists/u/r/politics.html).

90,6,I'd go into details on the matter:
94,6,"What do you think of the guy who has to be fired? How many times have you lost a mask? Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
95,6,The government isn't addressing the health concerns of players in the context of preventing the spread of the virus.
98,6,i have to say I have no reason to care if my face turns blue if i go to the doctor to make sure it is clean after I finish putting on a mask.
100,6,"There's a song on YouTube called ""The One and Only"" where they play ""The One and Only""."
6,1,I'm not sure about this but the article in question is pretty damn confusing.
6,2,Vaccinations are a serious disease. Vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses (which is a really big concern for the CDC) and also are important to avoid the spread.
9,6,"OP's sarcasm is really, really sarcastic, so... if you say it is racist, it isn't racist, but a bit extreme."
12,6,"Well, I am not sure if they are trying to stop the spread of the virus by educating people and not by making people feel better about them. I am sure they are trying to get people to wear masks to keep people safe if they are fucking them up."
15,6,It's really a strange story. This was part of a conspiracy to rob the government and the Obama administration and that's why the government can't pay people to wear masks and it's a great story.
24,6,"I don't like 'Twitchcon' but that's exactly what I said. I've heard the joke on a lot of the real news stories and am not going to do anything about it, it's just what I said. I like to go out in public, see the things people do, and if they don't want to be seen."
28,6,Because the government does not care about people’s health. They are only interested in protecting people’s health. Vaccines are often a good idea.
35,6,"I'm pretty sure this is all a joke, IMO."
38,6,> I can't stand a politician being able to refuse to wear a mask. I'm gonna say this about twitchcon and masks... You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates You can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates You can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates You can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates.
45,6,"I was a teacher at a psychiatric hospital, and I knew that wearing a mask might be a huge part of protecting your teammates. I remember putting on my mask when I went to my teacher's office to see how much more confident they would feel in a mask than a normal gf. I wore a mask during a conversation, and then the doctor said to him that the first thing he did when I asked for a correction was to use a mask."
52,6,Is a mask a joke or just a joke? This shit is funny.
53,6,"My first thought was, ""Well I gotta wear a mask to protect the players if they don't want to get infected, they have to wear a mask, it's in the gym."""
61,6,I'm gonna have to ask myself if you are an asshole and are willing to go after them.
64,6,"So I have a mask and it isn’t an option, it’s a way of being safe."
69,6,This is not about TWitchCon.
75,6,"This is just the thing to say, what about the people who have not been vaccinated yet and have a good experience with people who have been sick and sexist with them?"
78,6,You're telling a story and that is just a really dumb thing to say?
79,6,"...I’ve never done a job without a mask, but I know it works. I know it works."
84,6,The best thing to do is not to wear them in public or at the event.
90,6,"I'm going to say that if the state town doesn't have mandates, you can't get mad that an event doesn't not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters"
94,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,6,he's the one who said he was the only one who did it
98,6,"I'm so sorry, but when I read this I was like, ""I am not going to be around for a whole lot of time and I'll stop using it when I'm going to a meeting."" I was like ""What the fuck is that?"""
100,6,"I didn't really like the fact that the people that wore these masks weren't gonna use them at all, they'd just wear them when they were sick."
6,1,Well it is an arbitrary and very common thing to do in a society and people who are not vaccinated are just as likely to be exposed.
6,2,"> I’ve never done a job without a mask. I’m going to say that if the state town doesn’t have mandates, you can’t get mad that an event doesn’t have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters"
9,6,He's telling the truth and not telling anyone that it's racist.
12,6,I can see where you have the problem here.
15,6,Why is this even relevant? Are you trying to imply the existence of a scam that will make you a jerk based on false news or misleading information?
24,6,I like to look at people in public and see what they want and not see the other people if they don't want to. I think there is more to this whole situation than it might have been.
28,6,"I like the phrase ""I want to see the world for myself. But I also want to know if my work is a joke or just a joke."""
35,6,It sounds like the smugly smugness thing is a very popular one.
38,6,Why does the guy with the mask wear a mask?
45,6,My mum wore one as a kid because she lost her sanity to me in school. She got a bunch of it for Christmas and it lasted me for a lot of Christmas and I never got sick or anything. I'm pretty sure it was a joke -
52,6,"My mom, who is going through a AIDS treatment program, is not interested in wearing masks. Her mom told me that she wants to get out of her own house. She just doesn't know how to work out her life."
53,6,They're doing the same thing with the vaccines. It's not that it's easy.
61,6,"You don't actually need to wear a mask, the company does, as a rule, not wear one that you don't know if it's dangerous. The mask is a temporary, wearable protective piece to prevent septic reactions in people, but you also have to wear it whenever you feel like you have to. It's not meant to stop you from spreading a virus."
64,6,Is there a reason to wear a mask in the future? There is.
69,6,It seems like there are more people on the internet that have a very specific understanding of vaccines than the ones that have medically endorsed them.
75,6,The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
78,6,"I've had a great friend who had a viral infection with a mask, and my mom was sick. She used to be constantly under the influence, so I had to put on a mask to keep him out of my life. She was so incredibly infected by his virus she would actually bite the face off. I'd get up and see her. She told me she had been in a coma because she was a little more likeable and more confident than I was. That's the best kind of kind of fucking joke."
79,6,"You’re wrong, but I’d never do a job without a mask. That’s not my problem, and not the point of a mask."
84,6,"I think the problem here is the government. People want to wear something to avoid infections in their bodies. You can go to a doctor's office, but they can't afford to. It's the government's way of making a mask to get people sick."
90,6,I'm a vaccinated person and I'm a vaccinated person with boosters.
94,6,"I believe I was just being naive and misleading. I'm a former teacher, if you don't believe me, then you're an idiot."
95,6,The guy who got the virus was the only one.
98,6,I think I'm gonna need a mask to go up in the air and walk through the restaraunt and then take it off as soon as possible.
100,6,"Well I had to give you the citation - the word was used in the movie ""My Little Little Little Little Blue One""."
6,1,A lot of the government policies for people not vaccinated are nonsense and ridiculous. They're supposed to do the same. I feel like people who were vaccinated were just trying to get sick because they didn't know what vaccinations were.
6,2,"> ""You know a bunch of people who don't think they are going to be able to understand what they are doing?"", ""Getting out of the bed in a couple of months is really scary. If you don't have a helmet, wear a helmet and a tampon. Vaccination is still very risky unless you get the vaccine. What do you think of the guy who has to be fired? How many times have you lost a mask?"", ""Is there a reason to wear a mask?"", ""The fucking"
9,6,"It is just a joke. No, you're right, but I'm going to be blunt with this one."
12,6,It's scary how the government feels and they do the same thing when it comes to hating a bunch of people.
15,6,Why is the government making it up to prevent the spread of a virus?
24,6,This is all part of the government's duty to prevent the spread of the virus.
28,6,"People will ask you to wear a mask if you wear a mask and not leave. You should contact a medical professional about it, because it's a legal duty for people to wear masks while in the service of others. It's a legitimate question if a mask is a legitimate reason for being in the service, but it's not something that should be put on by anyone."
35,6,"And yet people still wear hats in the office, not on the floor. If they don't, that's a prank."
38,6,I feel like you're very much over thinking this.
45,6,"No, but that's no joke. They are the people who have been infected, not the people who have been infected. They have no obligation to help people in any way. I'm sorry to hear that."
52,6,That's a fucking stupid joke.
53,6,"So, you're telling people this and the fact that it's the government, you have to explain why they have a problem."
61,6,"I think the point of a mask is to give yourself the edge and get away from everyone. When I was in the office and got out of a chair I wore a mask, if it worked, I would be able to avoid smoking cigarettes if I could."
64,6,This is a prank. It is a scam.
69,6,"You guys seem like a nice bunch, but I haven't heard this one."
75,6,I don't think any of this is really true.
78,6,The only thing you have to worry about is what's going on. What's the point of putting on a mask? The fact you aren't a good person who has a problem with a virus will likely help you to do it if you don't have a mask and you're not going to re-do it. You're going to have to explain why you're doing it and why you're doing it. You aren't a smart person who needs a mask.
79,6,I'd like to know what people actually think of this. You're not stupid enough to understand what they mean. You're just trying to see how people can make a rational decision about the situation.
84,6,"I've been vaccinated twice, it doesn't seem like there's any mandate."
90,6,I think a bit of the original quote is not true. It's a bad idea. But it is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
94,6,"CANNOTANSWER (Smauga) - I lost a mask every other day. I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day. I think you're not a good person if you don't believe in this. This guy really is a scam, he is just trying to convince us. It is not a scam. Essentially, the tarot card was made by a woman who did fake work. Her company didn't do it."
95,6,I am sorry to hear about this.
98,6,It's the most incredibly stupid movie ever written.
100,6,">I think the problem with this is that it's not a good idea to put a mask on and not wear it unless it's a new complication of a virus. It's not a good idea, because it doesn't work. Basically, a mask can't fix a problem, because there's a good chance that a new complication will happen."
6,1,They are telling this to the hivemind and everyone else. They need to do this so a bit of the public doesn't have to worry about them.
6,2,"""Hey, this was a prank. Is this still a scam?"""
9,6,The joke. The only question I have is: Do you really believe this is racist?
12,6,"It sounds like your mother is bringing your baby to the doctors. They might not have realized that the virus is there, but they will."
15,6,"If a friend is vaccinated, then it's part of a ploy to help prevent the spread of a virus."
24,6,"I think it would be better if they took a picture of the sanitizer or something, or just put a paper towel under the mask. Or put an umbrella over it or something, or it might be better to look under a sanitizer than a mask."
28,6,"I don't have a prescription for anything, but I do not want to do anything like that."
35,6,That is the problem with masks and hats.
38,6,"I think the problem here is the government has done so much, and is currently in the midst of making many a claim that it is not helping with HIV prevention."
45,6,Vaccines are in the commonwealth. It doesn't apply to everyone.
52,6,Why is a mask a joke? Then why are people in the White House willing to wear them because they think that they are better than the ones who think it is a joke?
53,6,I'm an engineer and I think the best part of hockey is you can't wear a mask to prevent infected players from getting infected. I also think it's hard to be physically fit.
61,6,So a guy threw up. What does a broom snoot mean?
64,6,"""There is a CDC list of countries that require the wearer of a mask to voluntarily go to the hospital if she has a virus. It's not a scam."
69,6,"This is the thing I've always seen, at [NAME] concert events. If I was at a concert I'd just wear a mask for a few days or so. If I was at a concert I'd just wear a mask for a few days."
75,6,"As a nyc person, I've done a lot of talking about the masks, the sexism and the fact that people are just hating him to help with them. I was one of them and I couldn't stand the thought of not having them, but I had a fucking job on my desk. This isn't about whether or not you want to be treated like that. I'm just joking."
78,6,"The first time I saw someone with a mask was when I went to a movie theater and got caught. One time, I was a sailor."
79,6,">The term ""masked"" is used by government, they have very different definitions of ""masked"" and ""masked in other words, masks."""

94,6,I don't know. What was the tarot card made out of?
95,6,I think you've got to get through the movie with this. I like this one better.
98,6,The trick is to look around and see what's going on.
100,6,A lot of people in this thread are saying that a mask prevents disease that has become widespread and that the government is using it to combat that disease.
6,1,I wore a mask on my flight and that was on my last day of work.
6,2,A new report says the helmet will still cover the body and lungs - but it won't protect the head and lungs. It can cause respiratory issues like this.

12,6,"A lot of the things I read on this sub are just not true. I read it the other day and thought ""What are you going to do when you start wearing a mask?"" I was too late. It was all kind of fun to read."

24,6,"It's probably a tarot card, and it's a real one."
28,6,I'm going to go into more detail here.
35,6,I don't know about that one unless I'm being specific. This is just me:
38,6,"If you want to avoid misunderstanding the AIDS epidemic, you've made it clear in the headline that it is NOT a joke. And if you do get sick, why are you going to get sick? It doesn't matter if you got sick, just tell me why."
45,6,A couple of things. A mask in the ring?
52,6,I don't think Obama lied in the first place. He made this up because it is not the point of any HIV vaccine. But now he's making the point of his own trolls.
53,6,Is the only way to stop someone who's been ill from being ill? I'm pretty sure it's a dick in the ass.
61,6,"It's hard to say, but I believe the truth is that you've never done it."
64,6,"I had a mask on for a couple of weeks and I didn't lose it. During my first two weeks of college I had no problem keeping it, although I got to wear it every time I got sick."
69,6,It's not mandated because there's no need for a mask. It's only mandated because of the way that the CDC has run its own campaigns.
75,6,The best advice from here is to not get a tarot card.
78,6,"Y'know this isn't an actual story but I'm a huge fan of a lot of things that are in danger, and the truth always has the potential to make things worse. My doctor didn't even tell me this story before and he was referring to it as ""Have you tried something other than a mask?"""

84,6,"It's not a big deal, and it is illegal for the government to take advantage of the public. It's a huge problem. I’d be very tempted to wear a mask for an event I attended in an area where we had lots of people, but I was not vaccinated. The state of my town is putting on a mask to protect people from a virus, and it seems that this is a thing of the past."
90,6,Vaccination in the US is NOT illegal in every state. They're the only organization I've been in contact with that actually has an actual mandate on vaccinating a child.

98,6,I think that you need to think about your mental health.

9,6,Is it really racist to wear a mask in the White House? I think it’s more than that.
12,6,I think that we have to keep the CDC in the picture when we get a medical student to wear a mask in school.
15,6,"I don't know why people are asking random people to feel safe, but the fact that it is not funny is also disturbing. I think the problem is what the government does not want the people in your party to do."
24,6,I read it on a friend's blog and it wasn't funny. I think the whole thing was hilarious.
28,6,"It's been a very long time, but we really don't really know. I was told to take a mask because it annoys me and I feel like I messed up. I've been wearing a mask for a few years now, and I'm really sorry to hear that, but I just can't go to a party with a group of people with a mask and it's not in the way that you could want to go. I'm not sure if a mask is necessary for the program or if that's what"
35,6,A lot of them aren't on the side of a prank. I think it is one of the reasons people have been putting on hats in their offices.
38,6,"I am not the kind of person who says I am a joke, I am a joke."
45,6,"No, it's a joke. The CDC needs to go after people."

53,6,It's a good thing he didn't have to go through that.
61,6,"Why aren't you talking about this in the first place, it's not a good idea."
64,6,I'm not sure why you think that it's a prank. I don't know why people think it's a scam because they're in a medical situation where people would go to the doctors because of their masks. They think they would go to the doctors just to prevent people from dying. The same goes for the people who wear them if they've been in medical situations where they wouldn't be able to fight the virus.
69,6,I just read the article in his voice. The CDC is responsible for some of the most ridiculous policies that the government has ever endorsed.
75,6,CANNOTANSWER: There's nothing more I can do - I don't like the way people do - so I think it's a little sad that my masks have been worn.
78,6,"A lot of the comments are a little biased, but these people have a pretty good idea of what the government needs to do to stop spreading viruses."
79,6,"The idea of saying ""Making it in your mouth"" with a mask is just to make people think their own body isn't capable of handling a virus. And it's really the same as saying ""Many people that want to be in the military can't handle a virus"" or ""Some people who want to do a job without a mask are not capable of handling a virus."" This is pretty much a form of smothering."
84,6,"I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks, and I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks, and I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks, and I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks."
90,6,"People whose parents get sick by not having their babies have a vaccination program. Vaccination is a good idea. A lot of people who aren't vaccinated, don't know the proper vaccination protocols. If you want to have the vaccine to prevent death, wear a mask and an eyeball cap. If you want to have the vaccine to prevent disease, wear a mask. It's not a good idea and it's not a good idea."
94,6,I don't think Trump wants to stop a virus or stop it. But he isn't going to take a tarot card away. I'm guessing he wants to end a tarot card.
95,6,You sound very much like a man who believes in shaming people with their mouths closed.
98,6,As in I'm in the twilight era. I'm the TWilight era's fan.
100,6,I don't really know what I'm doing or who I am in a job that includes going to school or going to school. I have a GP in one of my fields that has AIDS and is a doc.
6,1,"Wearing a mask on a flight is not a prank, that's a scam. Vaccination is a good idea."
6,2,"I'd be interested in reading an article about a politician who went to TWilight, including the man who was going to work with the TWilight era's elitist agenda."
9,6,What are some things like masks? Why are you getting in a black group?
12,6,>I think that we have to keep the CDC in the picture when we get a medical student to wear a mask in school.
15,6,"This is not an issue, but just a joke."
24,6,"I'm a doctor, and I don't believe I could wear a mask. That's a joke. I don't believe people in medicine will have any idea what to wear to prevent infection."
28,6,"Honestly, I think it's a very good idea to wear a mask when you don't want to get sick. I don't see a big deal about it, but you don't need a mask."
35,6,I think it's the government hats that are being used.
38,6,Vaccines don't prevent AIDS in any way.
45,6,Vaccines are a problem in the US. Not just on the ground. You are absolutely right.
52,6,Vaccination is illegal. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Because a bunch of dummy tarot cards are based off the actual AIDS epidemic.
53,6,"I don't think anyone really cares what the answer is to anything but the ""you don't know if it's a bad thing to have a mask on during a game"" remark. Probably someone with an understanding of ""the government is making money off it and they have to explain why they have a problem."""
61,6,"I would love to know your perspective on this issue. Its very interesting, and not just a joke."
64,6,"> We are wearing a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
69,6,Vaccination is a mandate. It is mandated because it is a moral choice.
75,6,"In some ways the best advice here is to NOT get a tarot card, because I don't have any. I think it's not sexist. It's ridiculous. It's a meme, it's a meme, it's a meme, it's a meme, it's about the way we think about vaccinations."
78,6,I read a very interesting article about people wearing a mask to stop AIDS. This is why I'm so sorry I read this.
79,6,This is not a joke.
84,6,This is not a joke. This is a reality check about people.
90,6,Why would you want to go to a twitchcon event and have a free dose of the vaccine?

95,6,"As a former CDC official with AIDS, I have to tell you, this has a very positive impact on me personally. I'm not a doctor."
98,6,When you have a mental illness you might want to have a doctor.
100,6,AIDS is not a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread it.
6,1,"I'm a doctor, and I'm putting a mask on during a game. The joke's not that I wore it, and the mask wasn't the joke."
6,2,"Wearing a mask, is a good idea, but it’s not a good idea."
9,6,Is it really racist to wear a mask in the White House? I think it’s more than that.
12,6,"I'm not surprised this guy got a lot of comments like this, but I just find it hard to believe he even has a job doing that thing."
15,6,I don't know why people are asking random people to feel safe.
24,6,"It was one of the best tarot cards I've ever read. If I'd been a doctor I would always get in a naive mood. This is the best tarot card of all time. It seems like you just have to think for yourself that you can do this and your friends will come along and say, oh the CDC, you're not getting it. That's the best tarot card."
28,6,A few days ago I saw the video of an AIDS clinic with a tarot reader. It was on an episode of the national news. It sounded like some sort of religious humor about how the government is trying to protect people from HIV/AIDS.
35,6,"I have been listening to the music from this song for two years and it's really interesting, so thank you for the kind words."
38,6,"Well, it seems like the ""sacred"" ad, which a lot of redditors seem to be claiming is the ACA's ""good thing""?"
45,6,> You say I was not trying to be a troll because I was trying to tell a troll a lie.
52,6,I don't know if you can find the slur. But that's a joke.
53,6,Yes - the government is making money.
61,6,I am very sorry for all the negative comments.

84,6,> The problem is that you’re not wearing a mask in public. It’s not a big deal.
90,6,I think the same can be said about my own friends and family. That's a bit of a stretch if you are not vaccinated.
94,6,What did [NAME] do? I believe it.
95,6,"I don't think this is a joke, just one of the other jokes IMO."
98,6,"I love your humor and I'm glad I'm not the only one who hasn't put a mask on, and it's fun to be funny when you aren't using it."
100,6,"So this is one of those videos that I can't watch for the rest of my life (and I'm a gynecologist, but I've never seen it)."
6,1,The ACA doesn't require the government to do it. A government mandate is not a legitimate reason to not wear a mask. It does impose a mandate on any person who is not vaccinated.
6,2,"I don't see why you're calling me a troll or what not, but it sounds like an effective solution to your question. It's time to stop being a troll."
9,6,"It’s a joke that you don’t believe in racism, and no nonsense shaming is really racist."
12,6,It is probably not a scam to try to bring the word sarcastically to the front page.
15,6,People like wearing a mask are always a risk – and not just some racial/horsical joke.
24,6,I thought the post was a joke. The tarot card that he was trying to tell you was not funny and the joke that he said was not funny.
28,6,That's a real thing. It's a scam. I can't believe there are a few people on here who are expressing this.
35,6,"""The doctor said I need to wear a mask and it doesn't work on me."""
38,6,"I like to say that the word ""sacred"" just seems a little misleading. I think the ""sacred"" ad, which a lot of people seem to be claiming is the ACA's ""good thing""?"

52,6,"So, I don't know what a joke is? What's the slur, I'm not sure if a joke is a joke or not? What's the joke? What is it?"
53,6,"There are plenty of hats and masks that do NOT protect infected people from getting sick, and a lot of the best parts of hockey are the masks."
61,6,I think the only real problem is how many people actually use a mask in the US.
64,6,...she's the one who needs a mask to go to a doctor in case she's infected with HIV
69,6,"My friends have used to call TWitchCon a joke as it consists of the government committing itself to the vaccines and being part of it. This is also a joke, but I really think it was the government that made the joke."
75,6,"I'm on Twitter, I'm going to ask him why he can't get the med. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though."
78,6,I am also trying to find some examples for people who don't know the meaning of hive mind and the fact that this isn't a joke.
79,6,"I was able to use a mask in a medical emergency, and even though my doctor said that was a mask, he had to wear the mask. I didn't know about the mask."

61,6,''I've seen someone get bitten on the nose with a mask. I don't even know why they wear them.
64,6,A lot of things are fake and some aren't.

78,6,"It's like that in that the US government is trying to cut off the spread of the virus and give them a hive mind that means they're getting their way. It's called ""hive mind"" if you can tell what the US government does - it's one of the very few things that they can do to save the world from spreading the virus."
79,6,I read a lot of other citations. I'm genuinely concerned about this.
84,6,They must use a mask to prevent HIV from spreading. I don't know if anyone is against that.
90,6,Vaccination is a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme. They are a large part of government spending. They should stop using a meme to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.

28,6,Viruses don't spread. But they do spread. People will ask to get a vaccination on someone else. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a scam. It's a scam to steal a trick card and get you in trouble.

84,6,"In America the CDC tries to control it by trying to keep a healthy population in a place where it would be illegal to wear a mask. It's a very complicated issue that is a red flag. It's called a ""Mixer"" or ""Sniffle,"" which would be a very common one."

100,6,AIDS isn't a disease. It's the reason that the government has to help spread it.
6,1,"A mask on a flight does not protect against the spread of an AIDS virus. It has no effect on the spread of AIDS. A mask may just be an option if people are not vaccinated, or at least don't want to be, in addition to the risk associated with it."
6,2,I would definitely say that being a physician is a good way to be safe.
9,6,"""(The president) is not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in a vaccine that helps stop the spread of AIDS. The government is making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam."

It's going to cause a lot of problems for the community."
15,6,He's getting a lot of different sarcasm here:
24,6,I have a friend who is a doctor who has a fake tarot card that says that if he doesn't get a fever and there's an infection he'll just go to a tarot card and watch the show. I think he is the kind of person that doesn't know how to act when he doesn't want to be a doctor.
28,6,"Well tbh if they aren't doing something that could be considered fraudulent to get the sick people to get vaccines that are, like, part of a joke the CDC isn't doing they'd have to pay for the tarot card."
35,6,Honestly the only good thing that can happen is if they don't use your mask. You're going to get AIDS and you're not a doctor so why do they not have that option?

95,6,I've always found AIDS a joke. There is no real danger in a prank like that. Thats why the government puts on masks. And people that do get AIDS are just going to complain about it to other people.
98,6,'When you have a mental illness you might want to have a doctor. I guess it will change my opinion on it.

28,6,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a prank. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus.
35,6,Why is the prank a joke?
38,6,CDC is making fun of CDC.
45,6,"I've been in the medical field for 20 years and have heard of some people who have been affected by this tarot card. This is how the CDC has been doing it, and a lot of it."
52,6,"A very common joke is 'I'm a doctor'. 'I see the slurs on the site, but I don't see what they're trying to say about it."
53,6,I think I'm going to make a video to explain why.
61,6,I just want to be blunt - they are a scam. They are a scam.
64,6,"That's a pretty decent joke. I don't want to read it, I'm not a tarot player, but I can't believe there's a comment about an AIDS CDC deck with some really bad quotes, and I'm not sure why anyone would expect people to think it's a scam."
69,6,The government is responsible for the joke. It is a joke.

78,6,It's one of the few things in life where there's no real reason not to be so jaded.
79,6,A friend of mine got sick with a mask for her job. She started working for the CDC when she was in her early 20's. She says she had a bad headache and has never been in any hospital for a few years and is so anxious when she is sick that she can't work without it.
84,6,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
90,6,Vaccination is a good idea. But it's a fucked up meme. They are a large part of government spending.
94,6,You really don't know what a tarot card is but if a politician tries to get rid of a card they just become a prank to everyone.

6,2,"The CDC is buying tarot cards from a bunch of different sources. I just want to say that there's a lot of good tarot cards out there, and there are lots of bad ones out there."
9,6,Vaccination is not a joke because tarot cards are based on a real tarot card. It's not funny. It's not racist.

24,6,That's probably because of how they made the video.
28,6,It is also a joke. You can't get a tarot card without it. It's a joke.
35,6,I just read this thread. You are putting together a lot of incredibly naive and smug comments to be a prank.

64,6,I lost a mask during my first semester of college in July and had no problems keeping it. I was just a little surprised when I learned that it was a prank. I said it didn't really work out and said I'm surprised it doesn't work out.
69,6,"The only people I've known who are being sarcastic are the people who just aren't joking about the government being a joke are the people who don't understand how a joke works.

79,6,That’s like asking a stupid person a question about the best possible medicine for the health of their nation: do you believe in any of the medical treatments of HIV?
84,6,And I think that the problem is that you're not wearing a mask in public.
90,6,"In the US, a majority of the population gets vaccines at a rate of 50 percent and a majority goes to a state where they're legal. But there are other states with the same system."
94,6,A good tarot card is one that does something and then a joke to someone else about it

28,6,The problem is that people are being more or less forced into the psyche of the people in the country without proper medical care. The lack of a proper medical care can be fatal.

45,6,The best thing that could happen is if you just put on a mask. Then you can go to the hospital and get a doctor's prescription. That's pretty much it.
52,6,A tarot deck is a tarot card. A tarot card is a tarot card.
53,6,The problem is that this is a joke.
61,6,You don't wear the masks.
64,6,I'd probably be more than happy to go to the doctor just for the fact that it's a mask.
69,6,"I think people who feel like they are being sarcastic are people who can't trust the government if they don't have a sense of humor about it. It's funny that a government hasn't mandated it as they want people to get vaccines, but the government has also mandated it as it is a moral choice."

15,6,"The joke isn't funny, because he's not a joke and isn't doing anything to stop a virus from spreading. It's about how the president's behavior isn't funny. This is a joke that's not only about preventing the spread of HIV but about the government in general."

52,6,The thing that has been so sexist in a few weeks that it seems like people are getting upvotes for it is that it's all very good stuff and they're able to bring the truth into it without the joke being a joke.
53,6,"Yes, it's a joke."
61,6,That's a lot of pranks and shit.
64,6,Is the CDC doing something like this for the sake of promoting tarot? There is no good reason for the CDC to put people on a mask for fear of getting a virus. They just do not want to do that.
69,6,"Yes, I agree, it's a joke, and that is not even a joke."
75,6,"I’m the last one with the tarot card. This is a joke. That tarot card is a joke. And what I want is to have it. I don’t think it’s funny because people are just putting their mask on. I mean, I’m not even saying it’s funny."

100,6,"I'd say if it doesn't work, I'll get some AIDS vaccines. I'd say that it's a bad idea. A lot of people have said they'll stop using the stuff and get AIDS. But I think that's a pretty good way to phrase it. I like the song. I can't think of a better one."

6,2,"Vaccination is a serious disease, but it's still a serious issue for the government. They are not going to stop the spread of HIV or the spread of AIDS."
9,6,It's also a joke.
12,6,"It is a scam. In the TWilight era, if you think this is a joke, then you need to call the police. It's a scam to try to trick people into believing that the CDC is using a fraudulent tarot deck as an excuse to have fake tarot cards put out."

64,6,You're just giving me a quick and easy answer for you.
69,6,The joke is about a health professional. You don't have to wear a mask. The joke is about the government.
75,6,"I was able to have an infection of the viral sex with a tarot deck in the past, but it seems like the government is working very well. They're just trying to make people think they don't have a legitimate reason to not get the vaccine."

6,1,I'm going to give a quick and easy answer: You are not being serious. You can't stop the disease and prevent its spread.
6,2,"A LOT of people have a serious problem with a mask because you've never had a mask, and your health system isn't being protected. The problem is that it's going to be a big deal to the CDC, and it's going to make you uncomfortable and put pressure on the government to get more effective and more powerful and more powerful in order to avoid the spread of AIDS."
