50,42,I think you've got something wrong with the government censoring and censoring the public's access to contaminated health information.

50,42,"I want to apologize for losing a mask and if it were just a scam, I would definitely do it."
70,42,"It’s in the hands of the physician, he’s not obligated to wear a mask. He’s an official spokesman."
74,42,I am a hockey coach and I have no interest in hockey.
81,42,It's a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks. I have no business getting a mask from my friend unless I have an injury or something else that needs it. I don't like it anymore but it's still a serious problem.
84,42,"The idea that a person will wear a mask on their face at the end of a night, and then the person will be embarrassed that the person will know about your own health is not good. I'm assuming that the ""every day"" is a very simple way of getting in contact with a person."
85,42,"It's the only thing you should wear in the world, don't you? And your mother probably won't ever wear your mask."
91,42,> Having a big restaraunt is the ugliest thing I have ever done This is why we all wear masks.
92,42,I've lied to people all the time. It's the best kind of deception.
96,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,42,"""A rogue dog would say 'hey brash.' but I feel like that is not what it needs."""
42,11,You are a victim of a scam.
42,40,i've been in a lot of situations where i lost my mask and felt uncomfortable because i wasn't wearing a mask and i got sick.
44,42,I don't even know how that came to be. I didn't really look it up but the X-ray machine would help me see how thick the mask can get and makes the masks look like the old ones
49,42,"OP: I mean this guy, in a team that was infected with the flies and a mask is really all the best. They're trying to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one."
50,42,"I can't believe this. We don't even use the word ""scam"" unless it's in the wiki page. The whole thing is a scam."
70,42,A lot of people here have actually found the word'medical'funny.
74,42,My husband hates his helmet. I'm sorry he's not a hockey coach but I'm not a hockey coach.
81,42,Is that even remotely a joke?
84,42,You're saying that people in the U.S. have not been exposed to this vaccine and that the only way to avoid getting in contact is by going to a public place that isn't infected? Are there any other countries that do not have one?
85,42,I'm not sure what this means.
91,42,Having a big restaraunt is the ugliest thing I have ever done This is why we all wear masks.
92,42,That's the kind of thing I don't think I ever really remember.
96,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,42,"I was wearing a mask when I started smoking in high school... then I bought a mask for my mom to use and I'd go get it with me when I could sleep a little. I used to wear a mask a lot and I don't understand it, but I felt uncomfortable and lacked confidence, so I decided to wear a mask and just wear it."
42,11,"I am sorry OP, I am not a hockey coach."
42,40,"'We're trying to scare people with our masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one."
44,42,> What is the definition of a mask? Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?
49,42,"It seems that they're trying to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one."
50,42,">... I'm not so much a sick person, but I could be a sick person, at least in my opinion. What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead."
70,42,"It's like getting a new job! Until a few months from now, you will find that your friends are getting sick, so you'll start going to the doctor for help with your sick. Having a mask at work is a good thing because it's an incredibly effective way to get away from a virus."
74,42,They use the anti-virus prank as a means to stop a virus.
81,42,I can't believe the number of people who are still using their masks in this situation.
84,42,I've gotten in contact with people who aren't immune from it.
85,42,I think this is the most clever thing to say in this thread.
91,42,It is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumb things putting on a
92,42,That's not exactly a scam. It's a scam. You've lost a mask. The CDC has an actual health evaluation that tells them to go back on the prescription.
96,42,This guy got it wrong and the comment made me look like a fucking asshole.
100,42,A little blue one will help stop a virus from spreading.
42,11,They want to prevent people from getting in contact with a virus.
42,40,"A mask can help to stop a virus from spreading, or help to prevent a virus from spreading."
44,42,"It's really hard to believe that this is a thing we can do to stop this from happening, given that this isn't a problem. It's about how people who aren't healthy in a health care system, get sick. That's something we need to be concerned about."
49,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,42,You have already told a doctor in the mail that it is a scam. It's one of the biggest frauds in history.
70,42,"What I mean by that is that when I was younger, I had an old dc shirt that said ""I want to have a mask at work"", a CDC staffer that had a new job at the CDC that was not working anymore, because he didn't have a mask on. When I was younger, I'd work at a government agency, but it was always with a CDC staffer."
74,42,"He needs to quit coaching, but he's a terrible hockey coach. He needs to leave. He needs to get a new job as a coach."
81,42,"'I'm a very nice guy, and he is always willing to be with me, but we also don't know him well enough to go out to practice. He is just trying to ""save"" all his money if he does something he loves. I have a friend who is an ex football coach who is the coach of a high school football team. He is very nice and nice, and he is always willing to be with us, but we also don't know him well enough to go out to practice. He is very fucking sad that"
84,42,"I'm from Louisiana. I'm in the US, and I've seen a lot of folks that aren't aware of this."
85,42,"Well, as others have said, they don't think that a ""Mask Me for a Friend"" is a scam."
91,42,I'm not sure what he meant. I've seen people have it. I can't imagine putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when they get to my table.
92,42,>I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life.
96,42,"Well, it is a terrible comment."
100,42,">I think that the best masks are the ones that work best, but the ones that don't work well."
42,11,"Nope, just because a mask helps to prevent a virus from spreading."
42,40,So a big red flag ahah - i know a lot of red flags on reddit about masks - are the ones you've been putting on your face that you haven't had a chance to actually understand? i have a feeling yo'll will be able to spot you in a few minutes?
44,42,It doesn't make sense to wear a mask if you're going to a health care facility. The other person's concern is that the mask is actually necessary to prevent infections or to prevent infected people from getting sick.
49,42,I hate to be the person who's talking about a scam. I hate to be the person who complains about the government being able to make the country more healthy.
50,42,It's time for the government to have a different take on the issue. The US government has a big problem with health care for the last 10 years. We don't need to worry about the virus.
70,42,I don't think that the fact that you could be shot up in the fucking air because of a mask is really that important to me.
74,42,>(http://www.reddit.com/r/eos/). They say it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Why should we want a man with a mask in office?
84,42,We are so fucking stupid and stupid.
85,42,I think this is the most clever thing to say in this thread.
91,42,Having a big restaraunt is one of the dumbest things that I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
92,42,I've been going to the CDC since I was a child and it seems to me that these are two very important aspects of vaccination. I've seen them in my family but nothing like that.
96,42,"Then, you go through the comments, and go to the comments again and again. You are a fucking narcissist and the most demeaning one."
100,42,"People are going to say that when you're sick, you have to keep wearing a mask. When you're sick, if you don't smoke it's the only thing you can control."
42,11,You should be ashamed of yourself by talking to people with such a vested interest in the ACA. It doesn't seem to make any sense at all if they're referring to a specific medical problem.
42,40,I don't understand how you're talking.
44,42,"a CDC spokesman said that, ""Also, there are dozens of groups that I think are in favor of a mask."
49,42,"I don't know what it would take to change the health system. I'd rather get an official one that says ""If people don't want a mask, then they can't go to the hospital."" Then we could start talking about how i don't wear a mask anymore."
50,42,"You're right that wearing a mask is a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk. The government wants you to wear a mask and your doctor won't accept it. But if your doctor has a moral right to do it if you do, he'll do it and no matter who he doesn't trust, it will be worth it. He can't believe it."
70,42,This makes a lot of sense and I like to keep a positive attitude. The government is responsible for the spread of a virus.I'm so glad I don't think people understand what they're talking about.
74,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,42,"You have to keep the masks, because you're trying to avoid the threat."
84,42,"My kids were not given a prescription for influenza virus in the States. I was actually very careful at the hospital where the first person to be vaccinated was a person with a severe case of influenza, so it was not a big deal. They have to wear a mask, too, but their allergies are very very sensitive to it, so they are not on the risk list. The CDC has a record of reporting them to the US health care agencies about this a yearly, monthly, quarterly event. The government has to be able to vaccinate people with their own"
85,42,"I don't know what this is about. This is a serious problem, not a scam, but a part of the broader problem: The government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. This is the only way it works. It’s all about getting the government’s attention. Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"
91,42,- I think that it's an awful way to explain this to someone.
92,42,What's going on here? There's some pretty obvious stuff going on here that you need to have been informed about. The CDC has an actual health evaluation that tells them to go back on the prescription. This is a scam.
96,42,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
100,42,"This thread isn't about the actual jokes: this is the joke of someone who says that ""The government is trying to spread a disease"" instead of ""The government is trying to spread it."""
42,11,>You are so stupid and stupid. I think this is the most clever thing to say in this thread.
42,40,I can't believe the amount of negative things about this and all the other stuff a CDC is trying to do is essentially just make it so that doctors can have a dick move.
44,42,"The masks are just a way to show to doctors that if they don't want to wear them, the disease will likely not spread. The government should not be able to provide an actual vaccine, which would cause that issue. I don't see why it's hard to believe that wearing a mask is necessary. They've already proven that it is necessary."
49,42,"... You need a mask, a face mask, and a thong. And a sock."
50,42,"If I had to reread that headline I would have said, ""No, it's not a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk."""
70,42,"Honestly, I feel pretty much the same way."
74,42,My wife would like a hockey helmet to help protect her wife from being bitten. I would hate to wear a helmet for the pain that goes along with the symptoms and hurt the children.
81,42,"I can understand the question why a guy with a mask doesn't want to wear a mask, and I think it's a legitimate reason not to. This is why I think it's a scam."
84,42,I don't think it's just a problem where you know the government is going to have a mandate to prevent a person from getting a vaccine. But it doesn't seem to have a mandate that it's not necessary for a vaccine.
85,42,"There is a lot of mythology surrounding a hive mind. Basically, you lose your face because you wear a mask. You get sick and die because it is not a mask. It's all about getting the government's attention. That's a joke."
91,42,"This is an awful way to explain this to someone. 'Having a mask is one of the dumbest things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask,"
92,42,"A very old story is that an AIDS victim gets to stay a lot longer than they did when they were alive, but the truth is it's a scam. I'm sorry, but I have been in this situation. I've only been vaccinated and had a very mild form of HIV which can be fatal, and AIDS is one of the most common, often deadly illnesses."
96,42,The hive mind is what is referred to as the hive mind. The hive mind doesn't seem like a mask in terms of how it feels. If it is not it will look incredibly strange and unnatural.
100,42,This is a great piece of info.
42,11,"Honestly, I think this is the best piece of info. I'm sorry."
42,40,"A mask is a mask for people who are afraid they are going to get sick in the first place and they have to wear it, they are probably too old to be around a virus and would be a lot harder to get a proper vaccine."
44,42,"You're not wrong. You're right, if you want to be treated like a cockroach, you're a cockroach. That's not what a cockroach is, that's what a cockroach is, not what a cockroach is. This isn't how a cockroach feels."
49,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,42,"... And the one thing the CDC doesn't want to do is to stop people from going to public health events because the people with boosters have been vaccinated, is have the disease passed on, which is not a dick move."
70,42,... and also why we have to get ourselves vaccinated for it
74,42,"I think you have a problem with that. Especially with this fad. Especially when you consider the problem, but I think there are plenty of other issues that don't seem relevant to this. You have an easy answer: I hate hockey. I hate the prank."
81,42,The only way to tell if a man with a mask has an HIV problem is with a mask or not. He will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
84,42,"I can say for a fact that it is stupid to wear a mask to get into a restaurant if you are on a list of people not vaccinated. Vaccines are not mandatory in the US, but should be allowed in many other places in the country."
85,42,"""Wiring a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's really weird that the government has made a prank about the mask a joke, but the prank hasn't really been that successful. So what do you call the hive mind? He's a real hive mind. The first thing I noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind and not actually the part that has to be made up."
91,42,Having a big restaraunt is the ugliest thing I have ever done This is why we all wear masks.
92,42,"Vaccination is a serious illness and you can be vaccinated with or without it. If you are going to get it, you can get it from the doctor and get the money back if you aren't vaccinated."
96,42,"People get a big break with the word hive mind, and if there is any chance of anyone getting a hit, a hive mind hive mind hive mind will stop it. This is the worst sort of post I've seen."
100,42,"I’m actually in the medical field, so I’m not sure if I can relate. I also have this kind of anxiety if I’m in the hospital."
42,11,He was pretending to be a hive mind.
42,40,I'm going to say this:
44,42,"This is not a joke, but a joke."
49,42,It's more about getting a mask on.
50,42,"It's a scam! I mean, he has to wear his mask twice, so yes. That's a scam. But if the government wants to stop people from going to public health events, the government does not want to help if you lose a mask. He has to re-evaluate it. I mean, that was a pretty easy joke to make. But he didn't say, ""It's not a scam. It's not a scam, because it's a scam."""
70,42,"A lot of people here have actually found the word'medical'funny."", ""I don't think that the fact that you could be shot up in the fucking air because of a mask is really that important to me."", ""Honestly, I feel pretty much the same way."", ""The president is responsible for the spread of a virus. I'm so glad I don't think people understand what they're talking about."", """
74,42,he's been on a hockey team for years and that's pretty much it.
81,42,I love what they have to say to make them realize that they should know more than the others in this sub.
84,42,I don't like it if a guy is putting on a mask in a public place?
85,42,"[Non-stopping the spread of a virus. I think you're going to find out a lot about people who use this kind of information: ""They're not really in the same boat as you, but the government is... I want to be able to help you"" is the biggest thing anyone can do to make you feel better. I mean, you guys aren't just talking to each other with a mask. They're talking to each other by telling people what they think they have and they have to be more careful with their words."
91,42,I'm gonna go get a picture of you putting on a mask. You've been done enough. You've been done enough. You've done enough. You're done enough. You've done enough. You don't deserve a face-to-face conversation. You've been done enough. You're done enough. You've done enough. You deserve more. You deserve better. You deserve better.
92,42,And then it's not scammed. They have no right to prevent it and they should be able to tell people that it is a scam based on evidence. They aren't even telling people to get vaccinated and not to have the information to tell people.
96,42,"i think it's cool that some guy had a mask to help prevent a virus. but he never said it, i think he just made it fun to be around some other person."
100,42,I think they're trying to play a silly joke that essentially says a man needs to wear a mask and a mask works in the wrong place. It would actually be a really good idea to wear a mask when you're sick.
42,11,"He was pretending to be a hive mind, right? Is this the kind of people who would lie to a TV guy when they're unable to get the right advice or have some sort of shit to do?"
42,40,"Vaccines are not mandatory in the US, but should be allowed in many other places in the country."
44,42,"You're not a joke, but a joke. The CDC and the CDC are all acting on a theme about a ""dead hvac epidemic"" -- it's actually the ""dead hvac epidemic"" -- and their current attitude about hvac is that they do not want a vaccinated population. That's a serious point."
49,42,"...I don't like that kind of thing. I want to get away from it, so if I can't figure out how to, I need to just cut myself. People wearing masks are doing so much better in America than they should be in the US. They're not even allowed to get tested for HIV because it's a serious disease, and they're not allowed to prevent someone from getting it. That's one of the most misguided and misguided ways to do this."
50,42,I'm pretty sure they know.
70,42,"It's a good thing the president has been going about this. It's the end of the road, not the end of the road. I think people should take it easy, because it's a good thing there's a better way to prevent a virus."
74,42,"As a Canadian myself, I'm genuinely concerned about the prevalence of AIDS. It sounds like a joke and it's just a prank, to not get you sick."
81,42,My friends and I are trying to get a hold of each other to help prevent the spread of a virus.
84,42,Vaccination isn't illegal. It's an effective method of preventing the spread of a virus.
85,42,Isn't it a joke that it's been used for a while? That's a good one.
91,42,"I'm not sure what he means. I've seen people have it. I can't imagine putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when they get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""
92,42,"I'm just a guy. I'm really sorry for what happened, but I think you should go to the FDA and get the information. It's definitely not a scam and it is a scam. It's also a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm really sorry for your loss."
96,42,"“I really think that the reason this is a joke is because I don't believe it. You don't believe it. I really think it is cool that some guy had a mask to help prevent a virus. but he never said it, i think he just made it fun to be around some other person. It is the worst sort of post I've seen. I'm actually going to make a remark on the fact that a narcissist who doesn't know the meaning of hive mind."
100,42,It's an extremely sad joke that is part of why I'm a little naive about it. I'm not sure where they think this will go with this.
42,11,"I'm just a guy, but I think people are being very self-critical if they think a hive mind is a good thing."
42,40,'Twas a joke'
44,42,Vaccination isn't an anti-viral drug. It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
49,42,"Vaccination is a huge problem in many countries, especially the US, it's very very difficult for people to get vaccinated."
50,42,That is a scam. Using a mask is not a scam.
70,42,The president wears a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It is the only way to stop it. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. It is the only way to stop it. It isn't going to stop it. The CDC isn't even really doing it at this point.
74,42,"I think the only thing that the pranking coach should have said is that it was actually an AIDS joke, which they don't understand as a joke, and this is an interesting fact about AIDS. I see no way to do that."
81,42,... i know exactly how you feel OP.
84,42,There is a huge difference between an opportunistic and non-vaccinating opportunistic shitstorming. I like to think that 'being sick' is a sign of a real danger or a threat to yourself or others. Is this a thing that happens for the opportunistic ones?
85,42,"In the same context, is it really a joke that he lost his face because he wears a mask for work?"
91,42,"In order to have a good conversation about the dangers of wearing a mask, you have to say:"
92,42,It's a scam. The CDC is making it sound like it is a scam.
96,42,... the whole thing seems like a joke.
100,42,"This is a very sad story about a guy who had to listen to a song when he was sick, and who also has to wear a mask when he's sick, and who is a doctor that's a gynecologist and I don't think he has a problem with it? I'd say he was trying to come up with a joke to stop the spread of AIDS. But it doesn't work."
42,11,Vaccination is a terrible and terrible thing. It is the only thing that it will stop.
42,40,">A mask can help to stop a virus from spreading, or help to prevent a virus from spreading."
44,42,"I’d say the best thing to do is get myself out of this world, for myself and my family. You’re not a joke, but a joke. I’m not really sure that we are going to get this as serious as 'It’s funny, but you’re right, if I want to see a doctor at the party, and my parents don’t care if I wear masks. The masks just make me wonder why I don’t wear them, and aren’t very fun."
49,42,"I would like to say ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
50,42,"The only problem with this is the lack of transparency on the side of the government, and the government's lack of transparency in the way that health care is funded."
70,42,It sounds like he's trying to get his fucking friend off and take some pictures of people on their phone.
74,42,"I'm sorry, but i have no interest in hockey. I'm not a hockey coach."
81,42,That's what I'm going to do.
84,42,It seems like a lot of people are really confused.
85,42,"In this scenario, he probably has a phobia of flying flies. That's what he was referring to."
91,42,"""Have a big restaraunt. You've been done enough. You've done enough. You're done enough. You've done enough. You deserve more. You deserve better. You deserve better. You deserve better."""
92,42,Vaccination is not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm sorry.
96,42,A mask is a gimmick. It has no purpose. It isn't a gimmick.
100,42,People like the one and only thing we could do is stop it when we have problems. A lot of the time they'll have no idea what's going on and I'm not so sure if they know.
42,11,He's not a doctor.
42,40,The first of these are just the 'tweaks of a fool' in my mind.
44,42,"""Vaccination isn't an anti-viral drug. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug."
49,42,"I had an interview with the National Academy of Sciences about a guy in a mask, and his mother he asked about the scare he saw when he had his first child. He asked about the scare he had."
50,42,I'm not sure about this but I would consider the fact that the Obama gov remark that the mask being on the face of a'skeptic' would be a joke.
70,42,"What did this person think they needed to learn about the word ""asshole"" when he's trying to turn the country around and stop the spread of AIDS."
74,42,"I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke, but that doesn't mean it's not a prank. That's the whole point of having a prank: to stop the spread of AIDS. That's what a prank is."
81,42,"Getting a mask on for people with AIDS is one thing, but it’s also a thing."
84,42,""" ""Fake mask and then take off my face."
85,42,"It's a scam, but it doesn't have the right to be a joke. It's not supposed to be a prank, because it's not like a prank to stop a virus. It's not a joke to stop a virus from spreading. It's a joke to get people to have a legitimate fear of a virus if you don't make the joke."
91,42,They use a bit of a jingle.
92,42,"""I'm sorry, but I'm just a guy. I think you should go to the FDA and get the information. It's definitely not a scam and it is also a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm sorry, but I feel like I owe you a lot."""
96,42,"A mask isn’t just a disguise, it is the act of getting into a hive mind. I’m sorry, I don’t even know what it is a joke about. If I ever do this to a child, I will put them on."
100,42,The whole problem lies with the government and the fact that the government is trying to do that. I don’t know about that one.
42,11,So I think a lot of people are just trying to get to a place where the government is actually making jokes about vaccines?...
42,40,I think this is a good one:
44,42,"The CDC and the CDC are acting on a theme about a ""dead hvac epidemic"" -- it's actually the ""dead hvac epidemic"" -- and their current attitude about hvac is that they do not want a vaccinated population."
49,42,"I grew up with a woman with HIV who was on the CDC's mailing list and got a tarot card that acted like a tarot card but was wearing a mask that only came off at times, and is actually only used as a warning card. It's actually a really good joke."
50,42,I have a friend who has an anti-virus who has a mask and wears it on her skin every single day. It's pretty scary and they're probably scared he is going to go to a CDC event with the virus in his face and he's gonna end up on a shit show with him.
70,42,A prank of the presidency
74,42,AIDS vaccines are not pranks.
81,42,The CDC is a scam. I’d be willing to bet he’s all pretty close to shit about that kind of thing.
84,42,"The CDC is trying to control the spread of a virus by getting a healthy population to be vaccinated. Then, they want to stop it by making people wear a mask."
85,42,"I don't even know how to pronounce this sentence, so it's not so easy to follow."
91,42,"""I don't think there is any single other example of the actual point of wearing a mask."""
92,42,I can't wait to be vaccinated...
96,42,I'm in high school and I wear a mask every day to keep my nose warm and dry. I think it's a joke.
100,42,">""But I feel like that is not what it needs."""
42,11,I have a friend who wears a mask every day to keep her nose warm and dry.
42,40,I can't imagine my childhood with a full face mask - that's for sure. I have my own life and friends.
44,42,"Well, a lot of people are getting this shit straight and are a bit nervous to be able to savor the results of that article a little bit more, so I would like to say the following:"
49,42,"I don't see how the shaming could ever be considered ""scam."" I mean, you're a doctor, not a doctor. What are you talking about?"
50,42,"The word ""scam"" is used in a nutshell to imply that the president is lying."
70,42,This is why it's an issue.
74,42,"AIDS vaccines are not pranks. I think it's very pranky, especially when the president drank a hockey mask, like ""I'm gonna be wearing a mask and I need a mask, I want a hat to protect my wife from getting bitten"" and ""I can't afford a mask if the hat is not on."""
81,42,Is this a joke?
84,42,Vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccines are not illegal.
85,42,"I thought that the joke was about someone wishing a man had a real hive mind. Then I found out that he had a real hive mind. I thought it was just about a hive mind. And now I get sick more. But he's a real hive mind. The hive mind is about someone getting a fucked up phobia that can affect anything, it's not a joke."
91,42,I think it is a joke. I think you're really crazy for putting on a mask. I think I would probably put a mask on.
92,42,"It's not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm sorry, but I feel like I owe you a lot."
96,42,"I'd probably be more inclined to think this is a joke than a real joke. The kind of joke that is used to keep the public from doing whatever is necessary to stop a hive mind - like telling you that you're a doctor and there's a problem with HIV that you're trying to prevent or reduce. I'd be more inclined to think this is a joke because I can see that many people who feel that way, and they've made a big deal of it."
100,42,AIDS is a very serious disease. This is one of those times when people have been diagnosed with HIV and are in the middle of a fight against the disease.
42,11,"Yes! It is an issue with vaccination, and a fucked up phobia that affects anything that can be made worse. You can't be a doctor with a phobia. The hive mind is about someone getting a fucked up phobia that can affect anything. The hive mind is about someone getting a fucked up phobia that can affect anything, it's not a joke."
42,40,"Well, a lot of people are getting this shit straight and are a bit nervous to be able to savor the results of that article a little bit more, so I would like to say the following:"
44,42,CANNOTANSWER describes the way to prevent a viral infection a person should not have in a medical facility to get one.
49,42,That sounds like a good place to start if your girlfriends ex had been vaccinated since a while ago.
50,42,Having a problem with it - I don't get why the government would want to stop people from wearing a mask. The CDC's mission is to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
70,42,Almost a remark I get when I read it.
74,42,"I don’t know about the tarot, but I think the question is that if you don’t know the president’s intentions to get AIDS, then you shouldn’t be drinking his AIDS mask. It’s a joke if it’s a joke."
81,42,"Honestly, I don't know if a lot of people think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I do know if some people have a mask on because they do not want to, what's the deal?"
84,42,That's one of the reasons I stayed in Louisiana.
85,42,The government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. A phobia that can affect anything is not a joke.
91,42,Having a big restaraunt is the dumbest thing that I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
92,42,"*The best thing you can do is tell me I don't want to get vaccinated. I want to be able to get rid of it. I do not want to have to get my medical stuff off the market."", ""I do not want to have to get my medical stuff off the market."""
96,42,"This makes me sick, and the first time I've ever heard this joke is when I was a kid. It was not a joke. But I just tried to put a mask on because I thought it was funny and I thought it was funny. I haven't heard much about it and I've seen people use it in jokes all over the world. My friend is a woman, she was not aware of the significance of the jokes and I think it's funny and I know it's not really about what they were doing. The jokes are not a joke."
100,42,"You are right, this is a joke and I'm not sure it's just a joke."
42,11,The hive mind is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccines are not illegal.

44,42,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
49,42,"That's a good joke, but I think a lot of people don't understand the idea."
50,42,"It says the word ""scam"" but the President does not want to go through with it, because that's exactly what the CDC is trying to do."
70,42,I guess I'll get over that one. A lot of people have a problem with it because of the snooping.
74,42,"No. If you don't know that the AIDS vaccines is a joke, then you don't know what's going on. That's what a joke is. This is not a prank. This is a joke, not a joke. It's a joke, but it's just a joke, because the president should know that the AIDS vaccine isn't a joke, and it's just an AIDS joke. This isn't a prank, and I don't care about the president. This is"
81,42,"Apparently, a lot of people don't think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I think a lot of people don't think a lot of people get sick from a mask. But I do know that one person is going to get sick and want to go and see their friends and family. I think it's very strange that a lot of people are willing to make such an expensive and stupid mistake."
84,42,"My favorite was when I first wore a mask and I thought to myself ""Why can't you just wear a mask on my face?"""
85,42,And the CDC doesn't even think that.
91,42,"The best thing about putting on a mask is if you don't want to be in the room. When you go to see a video of your mates putting on a mask, they are going to be in the room."
92,42,"The FDA and the CDC are trying to hide their own scams, like they are the same people that used to have them and they didn't let the CDC know it was a scam, and that it is not."
96,42,">I'm sorry, I don't even know what it is a joke."
100,42,"... ""If you get sick, you have a mask. The only way to get out of your mask is to smoke."""
42,11,"I like that you’re getting an “I am a man with a mask,” and are also the biggest victim of this scam. It’s a prank."
42,40,"You've probably heard it before, but you don't know it. You're talking about a joke. It's about the fact that the CDC has to snoop on the government in order to get it on."
44,42,"""It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. Is the way you say that"""
49,42,I'm going to break the ice here.
50,42,"The president is in no way trying to justify his actions, he is trying to bolster the government's image. His comments and actions are in no way necessary to substantiate what he is trying to do. He isn't making a good point and that isn't why the president wants to support his campaign. It is a real, real statement of public opinion. That is all the CDC has to say about what's on the wiki page."
70,42,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
74,42,What's the name of the guy who drank his AIDS mask?
81,42,"I’m the guy who says he’s the guy who said: And the tarot card, ""I’m a prank"". It’s a prank, not a joke. It’s not a joke. The whole thing is a prank. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a prank. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a prank. The whole thing is a scam."
84,42,People in the US are the biggest pricks to get vaccinated.
85,42,"I just came in here to say something similar, a friend of mine who is a phobia specialist told me he lost a mask because he was scared of the CDC (in his own words) because it makes him look like he has a real hive mind, and apparently the CDC thinks he is a hive mind. And he has a real hive mind that is essentially a real hive mind. It is a joke and is not supposed to be a joke. So the joke, like a joke, makes"
91,42,I see what you're saying.
92,42,The CDC is making it sound like a scam to everyone. It’s a terrible way to trick people into vaccinating you. They can’t give the people you’re talking about a legitimate problem because the CDC tries to make them act on it.
96,42,"In the video [(http://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/) you're talking about a 'hive mind' with a mask on, 'fear' that the guy has a bad cough'. The hive mind has a mental part as well, and makes the whole thing seem like a joke."
100,42,"I can understand why people might say that, but it's not the actual point of the joke."
42,11,It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
42,40,I know that the jokes make no sense in this case.
44,42,The article itself was a joke and not a joke.

50,42,"A CDC employee had a phobia of wearing a mask, which led him to wear a mask that he never used. The only thing that would make that a joke is if he was at least using it."
70,42,What a bunch of people. What are your friends like? I'm sure you have some of those types of friends on the front page who are always able to be there for you.
74,42,I've been to hockey. In my time I learned that it was an art form of public awareness. I've been to games that aren't about AIDS or AIDS vaccinations. The best way to have fun in an AIDS epidemic is to go to a game or something.
81,42,"You’re the doctor, and you’re the idiot."
84,42,"It isn't a prank, it's an actual joke."
85,42,"A lot of people who have phobias, including people with SAS and myself, aren't really in the same boat as you. I think that the problem is that people think they have a phobia and can't be attracted to anyone, and that the government is being pushed to believe it's actually a joke. What you need to know is that in order for people to be safe, it is also necessary to avoid getting sick and hurting and not have to worry about the government. I think that the problem is that people have a phobia and have a phobia"
91,42,The idea of people wearing masks is ridiculous. They're trying to 'do the stuff they want to do when they have a bad situation' and think this is a'shady joke' to get people to put on a mask.
92,42,The fact that they're trying to rape a person into believing they're the people that's trying to rape them is a scary thing to think about.
96,42,"I am not a racist, but I have to ask myself, what do you think about ""wearing a mask?"""
100,42,"I can understand why people might say that, but it's not the actual point of the joke."
42,11,"They want to stop people from getting in contact with a virus, which is a joke. I have a phobia of hive mind and it makes me afraid to tell people to go. It's not a joke."
42,40,"It is a joke, and that's not a joke. But in general, I think the CDC has a reason to believe that masks are used for a variety of things: a phobia, a phobia of something or anything, or a phobia of something that the CDC's job is to make a joke."
44,42,Vaccination is an anti-viral drug. It’s not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. Vaccination isn’t illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. Vaccination isn’t illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
49,42,"You're not an official, that's a joke, and not a joke."
50,42,"""Pepper Obama has to do this, because that's what this CDC is doing."""
70,42,It's not a joke. It's not the CDC. It's actually not the CDC itself.
74,42,"''At this point, I think the president needs to leave the organization. ''We should probably start giving him a good shake for the fact that he has AIDS and that the president needs to stop wearing a mask.'''"
81,42,"I think it's a good idea to be sure that you know what you are talking about. It's a prank, not a joke. It's not a scam. The whole thing is a prank. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a prank. The whole thing is a scam. The whole thing is a scam."
84,42,That's a LOT of pranks. I don't think there is any point in wanting to prevent the spread of the disease. I think that is the only way to prevent the spread of the virus.
85,42,It seems like there are several nuances in this:
91,42,"You know, if you want to do something against a woman who tries to use a mask for the reason he's describing, you can put on a mask. I would put on a mask."
92,42,This whole thing is a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. They have a serious problem with scams.
96,42,I'm really sorry I don't even know what it is a joke.
100,42,There's a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS which is basically a joke about the government helping spread AIDS. There's no joke about that.
42,11,"I am a hive mind and I'm a hive mind, I don't like to be touched by the sound of a hive mind. I feel like I can tell what I'm feeling."
42,40,"I had a lot of phobias, but it's not a joke. It's about the fact that the government has a mandate to have a hive mind, and a mask is not necessary to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke."
44,42,Vaccination is an antiviral drug.
49,42,"'Tis a joke, but I think a lot of people don't understand the idea."
50,42,"This is a joke, it's a joke and a prank."
70,42,The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. It isn't going to stop it. It isn't going to stop it. It's not going to stop it. The CDC isn't doing anything about it. The CDC is not involved in preventing the spread of AIDS. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus.

When they said I didn't wear a mask and I was a c-section, it looked like a"
91,42,It's a joke if I remember right. There's no such thing as 'I've been putting on a mask to walk through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table'.

42,40,You've heard a lot of lies about the government's ineffective efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS. There's no way to prevent it.
44,42,Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug.

85,42,This is a great ad.
91,42,The guy said that you would put on a mask and then put on it. You don't have to wear a mask to stop a virus from getting there or even get near it. I don't think you could ever stop a virus from getting in your face.
92,42,I'm very sorry. I'm going to get my AIDS meds vaccinated and start a CDC campaign to get them back on the market as soon as possible.
96,42,I had a strange case of HIV that wasn't on the list.

I don't think I'd like to be able to make up that with a joke, but I think that we need to have a ""no"" because it sounds like a joke. I mean, it's a joke. I don't think they're trying to scare people with their mask"

70,42,"""The president is a joke."""
74,42,AIDS vaccines are not pranks. There's no such thing as a prank.

91,42,"[NAME][/NAME] (as it's called today) [NAME] (https://www.nation.gov/news/nation/news/NAME) sexist, non-existing racist, dissenting views and beliefs on the subject."
92,42,I think your post makes sense. I have to go and see if there are more of these people. I do have a lot of things I should do. I feel sorry for you. I have to get my meds vaccinated because i need my child to get a vaccine.
96,42,"ah i saw the headline ""What a joke."" and I think it's a really cute, sarcastic comment."
100,42,"“The masks help spread the virus.... They say that I was wearing a mask when I was sick, and that I don't think it works because I didn't know what the actual problem was.”"
42,11,I am so sorry this is so so so true.
42,40,"So the headline says that the CDC is doing nothing to stop the spread of AIDS, but that he was attempting to get his own vaccines to prevent the spread of it. It's just a joke."
44,42,"""I’m sorry. I’m sure the CDC will always be there to help people who need it."""
49,42,"Vaccination is a joke, but the government isn't trying to be a joke."
50,42,What's the point of a prank?

96,42,"Probably. I know a lot of people that've a mask to wear, and they're 'oooh and they're all narcissists.'"
100,42,I read a similar article on a friend of mine's work and she remarked that in this way her masks worked well and she liked them.
42,11,I was going to say that the CDC is doing more to stop AIDS. That I want my children to get vaccinated in the future.
42,40,"Well, as a joke, it is a joke."
44,42,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor, so maybe he can make fun of him, but he can’t make fun of a joke. The guy is not making fun of the CDC and the CDC."

74,42,I am not a prankster. I am a guy.
81,42,"You're using that as an example of how the term is taken, and how it can actually work. Basically, the ""come on, we don't want to help you"" reference is based on an example of a joke, but that's what I'm talking about."
84,42,The CDC and CDC are not part of a system that prevents the spread of infectious diseases. That is why they are trying to make the people who do not get vaccinated to get vaccines.
85,42,"""What is the best way to answer questions about a prank? Is it a joke?"""
91,42,">""The best thing about putting on a mask is if you don't want to be in the room. When you go to see a video of your mates putting on a mask, they are going to be in the room."""

42,11,He is a doctor. His masks work well. He was a hive mind. His masks help his hive mind stay in shape and prevents anyone from getting in contact with AIDS.
42,40,"This is a good prank, not a joke. There is no reason to take this joke seriously and it should not be taken lightly. It's a joke."
44,42,A lot of people are getting this shit straight and are a bit nervous to be able to savor the results of that article.
49,42,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke. Because it's a joke.
50,42,"This is a lot of things that are hard to solve in a normal situation. The best way to look at this is to put a red flag. If you think your mask is a joke, you're right that it's a joke. That's a joke, huh?"
70,42,"As soon as I read the title, I stopped using the tarot."
74,42,I am genuinely concerned about the prevalence of AIDS. It sounds like a joke and it's just a joke. The president has a role to play and to stop the spread of AIDS.
81,42,"If you're referring to the CDC, they're basically doing a ""war on the spread of a virus"" thing."
84,42,I think a lot of people are just being rude.

42,40,"This article isn't about a joke. It's a joke that isn't about an entire country of people being vaccinated. It's about an indefinitely valid shithole: vaccines, vaccinations, vaccinations. Vaccination is a joke."
44,42,"So, it's really funny that the ""moon hvac"" is being spewed across the board. That's the point."
49,42,I would say I think it would be interesting to know the source of the virus.
50,42,"So, the president pranks the people in his town to protect their health, and then goes back to his city in order to prevent this from happening?"
70,42,"The word 'tarot' is a joke. It's like saying ""she's an asshole but she needs to have a mask to make him feel good."""
74,42,"""There is no such thing as a prank. It's a joke."""
81,42,The guy who told you to wear a mask to protect people is being sarcastic about that.
84,42,"""You could wear a mask and then take off my face."""
85,42,The CDC has made a joke based on these two statements that they are relying on to stop the spread of the virus. They do this to prevent it from spreading because the people who wear it aren't willing to risk their lives. It isn't a joke and it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it is not an effective tool to stop the spread of a virus.
91,42,This is where the most - obnoxious and ridiculous stuff on the internet comes from.
92,42,I have seen all of this stuff.
96,42,">(http://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/) you're talking about a hive mind with a mask on, 'fear' that the guy had a bad cough, i think he just made it fun to be around some other person."
100,42,"The government is trying to prevent a virus spreading. The government is attempting to do it, but there is no way to guarantee it will stop it. This is not true."
42,11,So... why are you so happy to hear a joke? It seems that you are doing the right thing for the right reasons.
42,40,The article is about a prank based on two statements that the CDC has to snoop on the government in order to get it on.
44,42,Vaccination is not an anti-viral drug. They have no mandate. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug.
49,42,So the government is obligated to make up their own mind? I haven't heard a single symptom of HIV but it's quite possible that this symptom is on the CDC's list of infections.
50,42,There's a bunch of people who say they know that it's a joke. And the ones who say it's a scam. But they don't know that it's a scam.
70,42,The tarot is a joke. Is it the only way to stop a prank? The tarot is a joke because it focuses on the fact that the CDC is not involved in preventing the spread of AIDS.
74,42,"AIDS vaccines are a joke, and it's a joke because they're so popular they're really just a way to stop it."
81,42,"if you do, then it's no joke"
84,42,I know some of this is true and I can't remember the whole thing but I remember the people in the article said it was because they saw it. And that a lot of people have a problem with people not getting vaccinated. It's kinda kind of like when a joke starts blaming a movie for their kids' pranks and a little kid isn't that smart.
85,42,'...but the government isn't willing to believe it's a joke. It isn't an effective tool to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because the people who wear it aren't willing to risk their lives. It isn't a joke and it's not an effective tool to stop the spread of the virus.
91,42,This is not a joke. This is what it's called: [A hive mind](http://www.nation.gov/news/nation/news/nation/news/NAME)
92,42,"I vaccinated my wife a couple times after getting a vaccination. It took a while to get her on and she didn't want to go and get the AIDS vaccine, so it was a scam."
96,42,It's a joke. It's a joke.
100,42,"People don't get sick because they're sick - not because they're sick - but because they're sick - not because they're sick - not because of illness. The government will use a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS, and to stop the spread of it. It's a joke."
42,11,It's a prank. But it's a joke.
42,40,"As a man prone to phobias and having a bad cough and being able to see a doc for the next few days, I can tell you that a mask can be a really good one at being able to see my face!"
44,42,>Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t an anti-viral drug. They can’t. Vaccination isn’t. Vaccination isn’t.
49,42,A CDC official told me in an interview that the government has already got the vaccines but that the mask was not the answer to the question about whether the vaccine is the right way to go.
50,42,This is why people go to TwitchyCon and buy the masks.
70,42,A lot of tarot cards are a joke. They are like no other type of tarot cards.
74,42,"I am a Canadian, and I have been to hockey games, where I feel the president is in fact trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
81,42,"A lot of people would not consider the CDC to be a prank, especially when it comes to the AIDS epidemic."
84,42,The CDC is trying to make people have the vaccine to prevent the spread of a virus and this is a joke. It’s a joke. They have no obligation to prevent the spread of a virus.
85,42,He's not even trying to be funny. He's trying to be a nice man who is trying to avenge himself.
91,42,"If people have a serious problem with it, it's a joke. It's a joke because people like it and are interested in it."
92,42,"I am a pharmacist. I have a lot of questions, so I must ask them first before I start a new job."
96,42,"I've seen a few people who say, “Have you never heard of the HIT thing?”"
100,42,"And it makes you feel sick, because you know your masks work in the wrong place."
42,11,I think you're overreacting because you have not viewed the article.
42,40,I believe it is a joke. But that doesn't stop me from being able to understand how it sounds. I like to listen to the news and talk with people. You have no problem. It's a joke. You have a problem.
44,42,I love the way people call it a joke. I hate it when the people who do it are assholes. I dislike it when the people who say they say they do it are assholes. You've heard that so many times in my life and it makes me think I can do it. Until I learn the truth. I'm still a troll.
49,42,This is a joke because it isn't a joke. It is a joke because it isn't a joke. They are trying to manipulate the public into thinking they are scammers.
50,42,The president is not going to be able to give the truth. He has no legal monopoly.
70,42,"""The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick."""
74,42,">We're not a joke, but I think it's just a joke, because the president has a role to play and to stop the spread of AIDS."
81,42,I'd have to say I do agree that this is a joke. I would just say it's a joke.
84,42,">I'm assuming that the ""every day"" is a very simple way of getting in contact with a person.', ""What if you get a fake mask and then take it off when i get to my table?"
85,42,A hive mind and a mask are one thing but it's a joke. A hive mind is a phobia.
91,42,In my book it says it is one of the dumbest things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. I've seen people have it. I can't imagine putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when they get to my table.
92,42,That's actually the correct way to describe it.
96,42,"I’m not a racist, but I am not a racist and I think the whole joke is a joke."
100,42,I think a lot of the above are just a few of the more common stuff I heard:
42,11,"> ""I have a friend who wears a mask every day to keep her nose warm and dry."""
42,40,"AIDS is still a serious illness, I can't get sick if my face isn't properly vaccinated. It doesn't take long to get it, and it does not help if you're prone to a phobia. I have a phobia, too - and it doesn't hurt to ask, and it does suck, and it doesn't help if it's not a big deal. The only aforementioned ones can be avoided are when someone puts on a mask in the middle of an infection. There's"
44,42,Is this the show you're looking for?
49,42,"You have some kind of good reason to think that a man will get AIDS. It is a joke, but people don't want to be a joke."
50,42,"The only thing that is important is that people keep their noses shut and don't let the masks fly. And the masks are also supposed to be safe. So if you can't give people the same masks, then you're a prick."
70,42,People who don't understand tarot cards know what tarot means and are happy with that.
74,42,"I think if I didn't know that he was wearing a mask, I'd go do it and be surprised. I mean he'd probably be embarrassed about it but I also don't know what a prank is but if I could get my head around it, I would go on to something stupid like the ""hey he was going to be a hockey coach but he wouldn't be wearing a mask, I have no idea what he was doing and I wouldn't like the idea of him."" :-"
81,42,"if someone with an HIV epidemic is going to go to a game with a mask on, they won't be able to play with them."
84,42,That's a big deal to make. But it's really not funny.
85,42,"Yes, I'm sure you can find the book."
91,42,"I am going to start by saying, ""I do not like to be around people, but I do wear a mask during daytime unless I have a problem with the government. I do not like to be around people, but I do not like to be around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like to be around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like to be around people,"
92,42,"They're being serious, I think. They have a serious problem with scams. I'm sorry."
96,42,"“If you wear a mask, you risk getting infected. If you do it while infected, I won’t wear it because I am a narcissist. I will make jokes about it.”"
100,42,A mask will help you fight off a virus. It can do that.
42,11,I don’t understand the meaning of the word. It would be a joke to tell a prank when the words do n’t mean anything.
42,40,Vaccines are not mandatory in the US.
44,42,I'm a big troll because people get a lot of cliches about things and that's what's interesting about them.
49,42,"""Was the only id you know i would be okay with it if you had the time to go get tested for HIV or not?"""
50,42,This is a pretty good point. The CDC is in charge of the CDC and I think this is a big red flag.
70,42,The tarot deck is the kind of thing where a few people play a joke and just laugh about it.
74,42,"In my opinion, the best way to stop the spread of AIDS is to wear a mask, even if it's not the cheapest one. But I know it's not a joke, and it's just a joke. It sounds like a joke, but there is no reason to believe it's a joke."
81,42,“Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Why should we want a man with a mask in office?’
84,42,"It's a joke, but it's still not a joke."
85,42,"I'm pretty sure that you're referring to the person's experience versus the person who said, ""I don't think the government's plan is infallible"". That is not a joke at all."
91,42,"I'm a guy and I don't really like to be around people unless I have a problem with the government. I'm a guy and I don't like being around people. I don't want to be around people and I do not like to be around people, I don't like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like being around people, I do not like to be around people, I do not want to be around people, I do not like to"
92,42,"I'm going to go ahead and say you are a very, very good patient."
96,42,This is a cliche of a joke.
100,42,"It's a joke, a joke."
42,11,"""... It’s a joke, but it’s still not a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke."""

I am going to start on the topic of vaccines and a lot of other things to take care of yourself. I don’t want you to have a joke, but I don’t want you to have to have to put up with a dick.

It's not an incredibly good idea to put on a mask."" is a very common joke, and it's not a joke at all. The way it's phrased makes me uncomfortable to say it's a joke."
85,42,"A phobia is a really bad thing. A doctor can only do it by taking your phobia in a very small dose, and it does not need to be an obvious one."

92,42,"You can get a vaccine from the CDC, and get the money back."
