58,2,"You're not kidding. The government is using it to stop a virus that is spread across the planet. But, I think you're completely right. There is a lot of bad information out there about that."

65,58,"""Leaving a big restaraunt is the ugliest thing I have ever done."""
74,58,"I'm just kidding about your username, it's crazy."
84,58,I think the only thing putting on a mask isn't to take a virus out of the body. And the reason that it's still there is because in a hospital it is considered a part of the medical system. You also have to make sure you have the proper medication that will work and are safe.
87,58,I'm so frustrated with the people who believe it's a good idea to go to the doctor and get a full blown HIV shot? I'm too tired of talking about them.

58,24,You gotta leave that behind.
65,58,The problem is the fact that ingraham didn't mention that wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It doesn't mean a person has the right to die and infect people.
74,58,I am a horrible hockey coach. I don't understand why you don't care.

95,58,"I don't see how they could prevent the spread of a virus when they're in the game with other players. There is also a book titled ""The Man Who Got The Virus,"" which is about how masks are used to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke to people to play on the ice for a good bit. But they are. The game just isn't going to stop. It'll just start and just stop. It's not like a guy who needs to change shirts."
58,2,"I think your OP is right, but I think the government should not use the mask to stop an infection because it can be harmful."
58,4,"This is a fucking fact. You're not going to change your hair, that's a good idea, and your hair isn't gonna tan. You could have the proper medication on hand, but don't eat it.
