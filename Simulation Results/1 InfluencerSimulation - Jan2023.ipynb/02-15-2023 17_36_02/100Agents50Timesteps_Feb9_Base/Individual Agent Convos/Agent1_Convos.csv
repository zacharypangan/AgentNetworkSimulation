2,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

6,1,"It's ok for you to do it, and it's completely acceptable to you not to do it. However, I'm going to snoop on twitch - it's still really ridiculous to not wear a mask. Seeing that a mask on you doesn't protect you from viruses like people wearing masks on their flights can't protect you from a virus."

11,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
13,1,"i do a lot of social distancing, but i do need a mask and a helmet"
18,1,"i've never seen an event with a mask, its just not for me. the issue with me is that there are only three things that you have to wear. i ve tried to walk ten feet for about a month and lost none, and it still has no effect on me. my mom always asks why i have a mask."

53,1,And yet he resigns the team.
61,1,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things I lose a mask at least four times a day.

6,1,I believe this story is going to be the last tidbit on a show I'm going to be watching.
7,1,"We have a lot of people that have been here for a while with a mask or a mask. But no, i think they have one of the best helmets."
11,1,You are absolutely correct. It's the same as just using a mask. It doesn't require a mask at all. It doesn't need a mask at all.
13,1,This is the biggest scam I've heard so far. The thing about using a mask is that it's a way of hiding viruses from the public.
18,1,">I'm wearing a mask, but I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a mask. Is the fact that you said to a friend, that you'd love to be a coach with them and not with the players are the dumbest things in the world? That's ridiculous."
33,1,"What is a virus?... The government has a whole bunch of ways to stop it. They are working on the mask and not the vaccine, which is what it is."
41,1,I'm glad it's been written in the right language.
52,1,"It sounds like the most important part of what the president is trying to do is to help prevent the spread of the virus. You don't know if that's the correct answer, but it sounds like he's the worst person to ever have to deal with it."
53,1,My friends were all gonna be a coach on the team that would not resign unless he was wearing a helmet or just getting his own one because he was resigned because the other team couldn't get a proper helmet.
61,1,It's the government's way of stopping the spread of a virus.
64,1,I eat so much shit.
78,1,What a horrible thing to say.
82,1,"I'm a very large American. My ancestors are a small family and I always assumed they were an orphan and a diseased child. That's how my dad's ancestors met a little girl I dated. So she grew up in the u.s. and that ovaries and ah, that sucks, but that's how my dad met a guy I used to fuck. I'm still a big fan of him a few years older. The fact he's not even "
95,1,I'm gonna go on and on.
2,1,The President doesn't know anything about the virus so we don't know.
6,1,I'm not sure about this but the article in question is pretty damn confusing.
7,1,">But no, I think they have one of the best helmets. I live in Texas and that's just my experience. It was a'scam', not a joke. Are you sure you don't want to work? You should get a fucking mask in order to get a job. I’ve been doing a bunch of things that I know nothing about."
11,1,OP is talking about a riot in Florida. A man with a booster can have to wear a mask. Why would you want to be in a riot when you don't have a mask at your party?
13,1,I was one of the first people to know what is in my mouth that is 'why is this so important for me'...
18,1,">[I'm wearing a mask, but I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a mask."
33,1,"As an official vaccine deterrent, they are essentially enabling you to get to the point that you need it (and that's a prank), and the vaccine isn't."
41,1,"The ""my man who got the virus"" book by Robert F. Devine is about how masks are used to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'd rather that the people who wear masks do not get paid to do it. So they just call people a team, and if they don't do something wrong they are a team? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
52,1,What I'm assuming is that wearing a mask is part of what the president is trying to do to help prevent the spread of the virus.

64,1,"So, you're saying, it doesn't help, it just helps prevent people from dying. You're telling the truth, it does, and it helps prevent people from dying, because if you don't have a mask, you won't die. I think the biggest problem isn't how long it's been in use. There's no reason to wear a mask if there are more people there than on the job. There's no reason to wear a mask if there are more people there than on the job."
78,1,"So you lose your mask to get in, and get sick, and then they're sick again. You'll be a jerk if you put on a mask and you don't do anything to stop it. What are you doing?"
82,1,>I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a mask
95,1,The government is supposed to have this. It's what they do.
2,1,"The truth is that Vaccinations are a serious disease, and prevent it from spreading in public."
6,1,Well it is an arbitrary and very common thing to do in a society and people who are not vaccinated are just as likely to be exposed.
7,1,"I'm a fan of the idea of wearing a mask. If I want to be more like someone who has a cough, I can use a mask. I want them to do something they don't want to do. That’s why I’ve been doing a bunch of things that I know nothing about.... The government has to take steps to prevent these types of accidents, including getting a vaccinated person into contact with a virus. I think the biggest problem isn’t how long it’s been in use. There’s no reason to wear "
11,1,"It is a problem of the government, right? If they don't know what it's supposed to protect, then there are no rules."
13,1,I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor.
18,1,"Apparently, the government is working on something similar. It's not really like we had to use that kind of legislation to prevent a virus from spreading in America."
33,1,"I'm going to say that as far as a vaccine going, the government is doing a lot of work trying to stop and disassociate those with a virus from getting to their nipples. The other point is that a mask is a very good thing for the public."
41,1,">I'd rather that the people who wear masks do not get paid to do it. So they just call people a team, and if they don't do something wrong they are a team? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
52,1,"If it is illegal for a doctor to make you sick, it is a good idea to wear a mask for a while, and for the time being they don't have to take a hysterical shitjob in the process."
53,1,"sex is bad & you shouldn't wear a mask and you should be very nervous about getting spooked. if someone puts a mask on and yells at me and tells me ""I'm just an asshole""...then i'll say ""I am just a little bit of an asshole."""
61,1,I'm a doctor.
64,1,"I'm from Australia and my first mask was ripped off. It was not supposed to do anything. It should only do it to prevent the spread of a virus. I had it and only wore it once a day, only after I started using it. I lost the ability to get on the internet at 12:59 PM."
78,1,"I mean, it's not that I lost my mask. But it did take me a bit longer to get back on my feet, which is why I don't wear my mask, and I had to go somewhere different. It was a pain in the ass for me, but now I have it. I don't wear it often enough to know if it's a problem or not."
82,1,I am very sick of people 'having a bad time' with their children when they have been vaccinated. I love wearing my mask but it's a horrible thing to do. My parents have not vaccinated me yet so I've only seen it for a few years. It's just an excuse.
95,1,">The man who got the virus was the only one. There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is. I don't think the government is the best at protecting the people, but it's kind of like ""The government has made up a story of what happened. I've been smothered in some of this nonsense for over a decade. I can't even imagine what a joke it is."
2,1,"I know it's a little sad, but I want to know why a bunch of people in this sub haven't taken the time to read the whole article. I have no idea where you're getting the whole concept of vaccines, and I don't really see why. The whole idea is pretty ridiculous. It's all I've ever heard of a medical professional stating a doctor's job is to be on top of a hat in order to save my life, because he's also got a very large hat. That's all I"
6,1,A lot of the government policies for people not vaccinated are nonsense and ridiculous. They're supposed to do the same. I feel like people who were vaccinated were just trying to get sick because they didn't know what vaccinations were.
7,1,">The best thing a parent can do when the sick kid isn't vaccinated is wear a mask. In the first place, it's because it is the one's that are supposed to be kept at the hospital. But when you put it on, you'll know if it's a scam."
11,1,''Applications of the mask'' isn't necessarily a fact.
13,1,It's an amazing system of a mask that is designed to prevent the spread of many virus infections in humans.
18,1,"In a world of medical technology, there's no excuse to put on masks. If a person is in public, they need to be careful, but it's hard to make a choice."
33,1,"I love that they don't actually use hats in the military. In fact, they don't apply them as a defense mechanism. They simply tell people to put on hats and it's a prank."
41,1,"A lot of people don't really believe it. A lot of people are a bit dickish, and I don't think the government really cares much."
52,1,... that's the joke.
53,1,A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from a virus. A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from the virus.
61,1,"It sounds like the whole government is not interested in the issue, but more of a joke."
64,1,>I've heard that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. What's your problem with a tshirt if you don't have one? No.
78,1,Why don't you just leave it in a plastic bag? It's not like you have to take the time to put on a mask or leave it on?
82,1,"I want you to know that if you get vaccinated you may want to know the facts and you can be honest, the best way to get vaccinated is to get vaccinated before you have a child."
95,1,">The man who got the virus was the only one. There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is.

2,1,">The President doesn't know anything about the virus so we don't know., ""The truth is that Vaccinations are a serious disease, and prevent it from spreading in public."
6,1,They are telling this to the hivemind and everyone else. They need to do this so a bit of the public doesn't have to worry about them.
7,1,">the best thing a parent can do when the sick kid isn't vaccinated is wear a mask. In the first place, it's because it is the one's that are supposed to be kept at the hospital. But when you put it on, you'll know if it's a scam."
11,1,"Why should a guy with a booster need a mask when he can't smother a virus in his life? That is not legal, I think it's not legal."
13,1,What's the difference between a tarot card and a fake tarot card? It's an amazing system of a mask that is designed to prevent the spread of many virus infections in humans.
18,1,The second sentence made me genuinely laugh.
33,1,[NAME] is a troll.
41,1,It is an excellent thing to ask a doctor or a lawyer. I can't help you see the link but I feel like this is a good place to start.
52,1,Why is this joke so old?
53,1,>But what about those pranks and rumors of the virus? Thats a good point.
61,1,"""It sounds like the whole government is not interested in the issue, but more of a joke."""
64,1,"A mask helps prevent the spread of a virus, and the same thing as a mask helps prevent people from dying."
78,1,"I know what you're getting at, but not all of it."
82,1,"Vaccination is the quickest and simplest way to treat AIDS, in my opinion. It doesn't require a doctor's opinion on your child's health, e.g. your child is at risk of developing AIDS, or you are having a hard time breathing, or you are a prick."
95,1,This is one of the things that keeps me going. My coach is always giving me jokes about how the government is trying to prevent a problem that he's been smothered by.
2,1,The tarot card is a great thing to have around. A lot of people would be a little more inclined to wear a mask to do something that may not be necessary for the actual CDC vaccine and just have it on for a moment to go.

11,1,"I'd suggest you go to the drugstore and see if anyone is coming in and ask what you think. Honestly, I'd recommend a mask."
13,1,"i'm a doctor and i am a doctor, it isn't that complicated."
18,1,"I don't think any of this should be funny or funny, but it's just a prank."
33,1,"It's an extremely dangerous thing, and it's a prank. It's a bad joke, and it's not good."
41,1,"The first thing you need to know is that, if it were me, I would tell people to fuck up. And if he's not comfortable with a helmet or using a mask, he will be screened. That's an absolute garbage comment. People are fucking a bunch of people."
52,1,Obama endorsed a vaccine in a crowded congressional seat.
53,1,It is really not a prank. I don't know much about the subject but it's just one part of it that is a lot of jokes and pranks in general.
61,1,"I am not an attorney. I am an attorney. I can not make a judgement call unless my attorney was right. i am an attorney, but it's not a choice."
64,1,"I think this is a little bit like a piece of shit, the CDC are trying to get someone to have the money for them to voluntarily go into the hospital and if it does the trick, the insurance companies will make a false claim."
78,1,"It's not really a joke. It's all a matter of what you say. I don't want to sound like a dumb, but it's true."
82,1,It's part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is not a scumbag thing to say.

2,1,"It has a lot to do with the people... but the fact that you are saying it isn't a scam, a fraud, and the fact that you are a troll is a huge red flag."
6,1,I wore a mask on my flight and that was on my last day of work.
7,1,"I mean I mean, they are getting a lot of pranks on the gov't. We've only been around it a few years. The people I worked with don't wear masks because they don't want to be in contact with people who are not vaccinated, and because they don't want to get sick."
11,1,I'm sorry but it's not legal to take a person to a riot.
13,1,"""The thing about using a mask is that it's a way of hiding viruses from the public."""
18,1,'What are you doing with this mask?'
33,1,What's the troll in the article?
41,1,As a former hospitalist I would say they're making a lot of money selling the “shrugs” so the government is essentially giving away information to keep the people safe and not to interfere with the health of the people.
52,1,"I think this is one of the things people have been saying in their post about the president, and that they have no need for him to use it."
53,1,"I mean, it's an interesting topic, but I don't really have a lot of facts to draw from here."
61,1,People seem to like the idea that if the government didn't do something to stop the spread of a virus then they would have to get away with the work.
64,1,"""If I had a mask I’d wear a helmet in the morning or in the morning and see a doctor if I got an infection. I don’t wear a mask. Then I’d just go to the doctor and say something like, “Wow, you have a mask!” He was a troll. AIDS and the same thing as HIV/AIDS are very different things. A mask is a very common virus, it helps prevent the spread of an illness, and a mask helps prevent people from dying."
78,1,"In my country we have a lot of different types of masks. Some of them are sex mascots, some are clones of the skin and others are resembling the skin of an animal, and others are similar."
82,1,"I have never read any tarot cards, so I know it's in this thread. I don't know where it came from, but in my experience, if you have any questions about a tarot card, you can try to explain it to someone else."

6,1,It's not a big deal. It's illegal.
7,1,"People in Texas are incredibly stupid - they get sick and get sick from a helmet and a mask. The problem is that even if the CDC were a scam, they have a government agency that would just do things like this and take it seriously. They don't want to deal with the issue, they just want to make sure it's something that doesn't happen."
11,1,"CANNOTANSWER: ""You have the right to wear a mask. It doesn't help if you're a military veteran, but it will save the lives of someone who is trying to stop the spread of a virus. I think you're being sarcastic. I think they really figured it out."""
13,1,"The government has been ad-free for years, and people are now saying that it isn't helping with HIV prevention."
18,1,My mom was the one to tell me I wasn't comfortable wearing a mask. I didn't understand why she didn't realize that I was wearing a mask! She thought putting a mask on was pretty pathetic but she didn't want it for her own safety. I told her that her husband was wrong and she said that she had a mask so she could have someone else run for her. She was being forced to do the same thing despite being told this was her job and that I would never let her putting on a mask. She would just have to do with it
33,1,a troll. what's the troll in the article?
41,1,"I'm a doctor. I don't understand a lot of the jokes, but I also think the 'hive mind' is just a silly way of looking at it. It's a joke, but the story is interesting."
52,1,The word mask is actually an extremely misleading term.
53,1,This isn't really a prank.
61,1,"They're funny, if you're looking for a job."
64,1,AIDS is not the same thing as HIV. They're the same thing and have a lot of similarities to the viruses. A lot of different things. A lot of different things. A lot of different things. A lot of different things.

They’re going to fuck with the CDC because they do not have the resources to do it, which they can’t do. But they’re going to fuck with the CDC. This will be a huge red flag to me. I’ve found myself not being a good person to wear the mask. I also have a really good medical school"
11,1,"They're putting a'mouse' on the head of the president because they aren't allowed to use a mask if they want, and they should be able to make it work."
13,1,"It's the only way to stop the spread of AIDS. And the only thing that is going on in my community is the virus. It is being spread through a mask. The people who can't make it in a safe environment, like their friends or family, and they are being infected are not allowed to have access to that information."
18,1,"> I'm wearing a mask, but I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a mask."
33,1,">We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
41,1,The movie has a lot of jokes about the government trying to stop the spread of AIDS and the people's lives. The movie is the story of how we can prevent HIV in people and stop them from being able to get that vaccine.
52,1,I don't know how it would sound to me if I said the other guy didn't know better.
53,1,A mask is supposed to protect the players from a virus. A dick in the ass is just that. A mask is supposed to protect the players from a virus. A dick in the ass is just that.

95,1,"My favorite part of the song was that the song ""Masked for Life"" was about how the government is using the mask to combat AIDS. It's a classic."
2,1,"Why are you reading this? I'm not sure that there's a lot of information available online about how the government treats the medical profession in various ways, from the people involved to the people themselves. It's an enormous amount of information available online about how the government treats the medical profession in various ways, from the people involved to the people themselves."
6,1,"I'm a doctor, and I'm putting a mask on during a game. The joke's not that I wore it, and the mask wasn't the joke."
7,1,The thing about not wearing a mask is the fact that it sucks and the CDC doesn’t believe in it at all.
11,1,I don't know how to write a joke.
13,1,The fact that the government doesn't exist is a sign of a serious mental illness. I'm in the US and this is why I'm sick.
18,1,[History of AIDS](http://www.cdc.gov/r/aids/reports/comments/advice/article/26/2009/42/advice/tarot-card-fake-tarot-card) is not a good source of information.
33,1,That's pretty ridiculous. It's a joke.
41,1,"I would say he isn't comfortable with a mask because he can't talk and is worried about the fact that the government doesn't want to change peoples lives. That is a shame, because it's a joke."
52,1,"I'm assuming the phrase ""why does the word mask sound misleading?"" is actually incorrect, and it's just a joke, or something along those lines. I don't have any good advice."
53,1,"It's not funny and is just a common joke in general, but what it's really not is because it makes you feel uncomfortable."
61,1,I wore a mask every day because of a 'vaccine' problem.
64,1,He fucked with this and it isn't a scam he has it's not a scam he uses it for. He can't trust the government and the people he works for who are going to be helping out as well.

82,1,"I'm very sick of people 'having a bad time' with their children when they have been vaccinated. I love wearing my mask but it's a horrible thing to do. My parents have not vaccinated me yet so I've only seen it for a few years. It's just an excuse. I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a mask"", ""I'm not sure if it's a valid reason for wearing a vaccinated"", ""I think it's worth saying"""
95,1,You are not joking. I think the government is the best at protecting the people.
2,1,I don't think you understand what an asshole this is.
6,1,The ACA doesn't require the government to do it. A government mandate is not a legitimate reason to not wear a mask. It does impose a mandate on any person who is not vaccinated.
7,1,I'm not a lawyer.
11,1,"The first three are very similar - it sounds like the people who can't speak in the original script, and they have a hard time speaking in the real script."
13,1,"I'm a doctor and I am a doctor, I just want to give you some advice on staph ring. I am a doc. It has nothing to do with the CDC."
18,1,"I think it's silly to assume that the president is using a prank on a team with an HIV problem, because it is a joke, and that it is not a prank in the sense that it can not prevent the spread of an illness. It's a prank and it should be avoided in any way conceivable, not just with a joke, but with the prank. The CDC is making money off of the hats. It's a joke. It's not a joke. I'm a joke,"
33,1,">I love that they don't actually use hats in the military. In fact, they don't apply them as a defense mechanism. They simply tell people to put on hats and it's a prank. It's a joke. I'm going to say that as far as a vaccine going, the government is doing a lot of work trying to stop and disassociate those with a virus from getting to their nipples. They simply tell people to put on hats and it's a hat."
41,1,The movie is the story of how we can prevent AIDS and the people's lives. The movie is the story of how we can prevent AIDS and the people's lives. The movie is the story of how we can prevent HIV in people and stop them from being able to get that vaccine. It's the story of how we can prevent HIV in people and stop them from getting that vaccine. They are more concerned with saving lives than any other profession.
52,1,The CDC is a sexist cult of the tarot. I'm very sorry that they're trying to cover up the fact that the CDC has been running in their circles for a while.
53,1,"The joke goes on, but a mask doesn't guarantee you a cure. It is supposed to protect the players from HIV/AIDS."
61,1,I've got the same problem with a lot of people who are actually getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads/ schemes/ lies.
64,1,That mask is an easy fix for AIDS. And it helps prevent AIDS.
78,1,"There's a little joke somewhere on a website called the ""Men Wear the Masks, You're a Texan""."
82,1,"[Wiping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see how there's anything I can do about the government making a fool out of that. I've heard people go to TwitchCon and think it's a scam. They just don't know why they're not going to do it. Vaccination is the best, most effective way to treat a virus. Vaccination isn't a scam."
95,1,It doesn't matter what he's saying. He's making a joke about a joke that's been made about people to do things that he doesn't really like.
2,1,The article says you are not talking about the government at all. You are talking about the government as the government is a very fucked up entity. A lot of people in this sub are not really interested in this or any other part of the government.
6,1,I don't think I have the time to write a joke. I'd say a bunch of jokes about the ACA are a bit ridiculous.
7,1,"The joke is that ""a lot of people who wear masks just don't realize it is for them and then decide to wear it if they don't like it."""
11,1,You need to write your own joke.
13,1,It is a big conspiracy to kill people. It's also pretty dangerous.
18,1,I think a lot of people would get a laugh out of this.
33,1,I was told that this was the only part of this post that is not relevant and was removed. So I will leave it at that. It seems to me like some of these people are in the US who are actually trying to change the way we know about vaccines. I am not sure how far this will go.
41,1,"I've read more than a few quotes based on this stuff, but you're still making the most point. The hive mind, not the mask."
52,1,I'm not really into trolls.
53,1,It's one of the most pranky jokes I have ever heard on Reddit.
61,1,"I have been bitten several times in the last few days with a mask. I'm not sure if I can explain what a mask is for, but i believe it helps alot."
64,1,"The CDC can make a fake, fake tarot card that uses the tarot ring. So basically, it's the tarot card that you get for selling a tarot card to people who have been told they have an infection, then sell the mask. It's very interesting that it has a tarot card that is fake, and that it's actually a tarot card that is really funny and you read it right? It's also very strange that it's being fake because a tarot card"
78,1,"I haven't read the article, and I don't think you've made it clear yet. Several of the reasons I think this is a joke are:"
82,1,>The problem is that they are making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
95,1,"No, I'm not joking. I'm just giving you a good ol' quote."
2,1,This is a lot of stuff you could use to sabotage your chances for survival.
6,1,>What exactly does a mask have to do with the spread of a virus?
7,1,"In Texas, if someone is getting sick in a mask, they are going to be on the ground and you will never know if you have the virus."
11,1,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Yes, you’re very right about racial profiling and you’ve made an excellent point about this."
13,1,Having a tarot card is a huge sign of a failing health system.
18,1,"i think it's funny to assume that the government is a bad idea and doesn't see the joke as a joke. I don't know what I'm gonna say i don't think it's a prank, but it's a prank."
33,1,"It's not a joke. It's an absurd joke. It's a prank, and a joke."
41,1,"""I'd rather that the people who wear masks do not get paid to do it. So they just call people a team, and if they don't do something wrong they are a team?"""
52,1,Is it really a joke? Why would anyone have an issue unless someone endorsed a vaccine?
53,1,I love a mask. I can't imagine people not wearing it to protect the athletes from HIV.
61,1,I've been bitten multiple times with a mask. I've not been bitten by a mosquito. I am a bit chubby.
64,1,The article is a bit misleading.
78,1,"This sub needs some answers. It's not a joke, just a bit of a prank."
82,1,"> The government is acting like a devil. A mask prevents the spread of a virus. It's basically a tarot card that says that if a tarot is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks, you don't need to have a deck on them. Vaccination is a scam because it's not a scam."
95,1,>I like the joke: [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
2,1,"I see your point, but this whole thing is really a joke. It's a joke that people are going to think that it's a scam."
6,1,"A mask on a flight does not protect against the spread of an AIDS virus. It has no effect on the spread of AIDS. A mask may just be an option if people are not vaccinated, or at least don't want to be, in addition to the risk associated with it."
7,1,I guess the point is if you are not vaccinated then there is no way to tell the difference.
11,1,A prank. It's not a joke. It's a fact. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
13,1,They were making fun of it.
18,1,I don't think there is anything wrong with this.
33,1,CDC and a bunch of other bad things aren't really allowed to ban such things.
41,1,"The entire tarot card was a joke. It isn't exactly a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke, and it isn't a joke. It's a joke."
52,1,"As a medical student in the DC area, I have a mask. I also have a mask with some stickers on it."
53,1,And the best part of the song is you just didn't yell at them and leave them with bad information.
61,1,> Is a mask a good idea? Vaccines are not an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus. It's an old joke a bit like a fake tarot card. I would not call the police for this...
64,1,"The truth is that if you think you know, if you don't know, if you haven't, then it's a scam."
78,1,I’m gonna be a doctor. It sounds like something about being a prick isn’t.
82,1,"I think it's a fraud and a good idea to use a fake one. It's also a shady way to rip out some other people's lives so it makes sense to try to disguise the truth for a legitimate reason. Vaccination is an inexpensive way to prevent disease, and it's a good way to stay out of some people's lives without going too far."

2,1,"I'm not sure you understand what this sub is about. It seems like a joke. That's what this sub is about. It doesn't have much to do with the news, and the public is always gonna be upvoting it."
6,1,It doesn't work. It's not a joke. It's a prank.
7,1,"My mom is a polio expert. I always wear a mask to go to the doctor, and she's my favorite."
11,1,I see the problem. I don't know why everyone thinks this is a joke or it's a joke. I can't even think of a thing like that.
13,1,So it's not just a scam. It's a big conspiracy to kill people. It's also pretty dangerous.
18,1,I have a great job with the CDC. I don't have a job with them because I'm not comfortable in public. I know it's silly for a guy to tell me his job is to help me in a situation like this.
33,1,a mask prevents the spread of a virus. CDC and a bunch of other bad things aren't really allowed to ban such things. Vaccination threw people off from a job they didn't want.
41,1,"Apparently, it's actually the 'hive mind' - a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
52,1,"It sounds like a joke, but it's actually a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
53,1,It's kind of funny that there's no such thing as a vaccination. Its just a scam. I'm guessing a lot of people think this is what the US government does. And it sounds like it's been putting on a lot of pranks.
61,1,... I think the government should not be doing a public health service.
64,1,"I've been a tarot player and a doctor, but I don't know what I'd do with my mask."
78,1,"It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. You said your phobia is not a joke?"
82,1,It's a scam. It's part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,1,This isn't something I've ever heard in a play.
2,1,The fact that you know why there's no ad hominem in the first place and you know what that means.
6,1,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
7,1,"Vaccination is an antiviral drug, but not an antiviral drug. I would wear a mask to avoid getting sick because of it. And I wouldn’t even need to worry about getting sick again when I’m in the hospital. It would just be the best thing to get a job."
11,1,This is why the government was forced to enact anti-HIV laws.
13,1,"I'm not really sure why the jokes on here are funny, they're really annoying."
18,1,>'The second sentence made me genuinely laugh.'
33,1,"A lot of people don't realize that the word tarot means a lot of things. You could say, ""Is that a prank? What are you saying?"" but the actual actual word is ""Hafe""."
41,1,"Apparently, it's actually the 'hive mind' - a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
52,1,"Yes, there is a legitimate reason why it is so important to wear a mask. If it's illegal, you need a mask. Vaccination isn't even a legitimate cause. It's just a joke."
53,1,I love that in my post. This has got to be one of the worst things I have ever read and read.
61,1,I think that your brother doesn't understand what the CDC is trying to do. It's a joke. It's actually a joke.
64,1,"OP: 'I'm not a tarot player. I've been a tarot player and a doctor, but I don't know what I'd do with my mask. I've been in a lot of fights and have had multiple scars. The article is really good, but I'm going to give some context as to why the title was ""a lot of the way he screamed it out"""
78,1,It's a joke. It's a joke.
82,1,"Vaccination is a scam because it's a fake tarot deck and it's a fake tarot card, which makes it extremely difficult for a lawyer to buy them. The only way to prevent AIDS is to get vaccinated."
95,1,"I'm really glad it's a movie instead of a joke. This isn't funny, but it's not about a prank. You are a comedian, which makes me want to laugh but to make a funny, fun movie. You are the worst."
2,1,"I'm sorry, but I've been thinking it was just some 'funny joke' about the whole thing. It's like you've never been in a situation where you have a mask. 'I believe that 'the president doesn't know anything about the virus so we don't know.'I believe that 'the tarot card is a great thing to have around. A lot of people would be a little more inclined to wear a mask to do something that may not be necessary in the real tarot card"
6,1,Is your team tarot?
7,1,"In this case, it would be the most obvious to a lot of people, and I don't have to think about what's a joke. If you don't care about the facts, then go to the doctor's office."
11,1,The government is not the government.
13,1,"I'm not sure I have a choice, but I will say that some of the most egregious things we've seen recently in this sub are:"
18,1,Then 'The second sentence makes me genuinely laugh.'
33,1,"the best way to say it, and I'll leave it at that."
41,1,It's also a way to prove that you are a doctor. The doctors are more concerned with saving lives than they are about preventing the spread of the disease. They are more concerned with preventing the spread of the disease. They are more concerned with preventing the spread of the disease. They are more concerned with preventing the spread of the virus. They are more concerned with preventing the spread of the disease. They are more concerned with preventing the spread of the virus.
52,1,It's really a joke. It isn't a joke.
53,1,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a scam because the government is trying to create a dangerous environment.
61,1,We're talking about the fact that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,1,"I'd like to say something like: """"We have been wearing a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
78,1,I've got my head under my breath thinking about the shit we eat as well as the joke.
82,1,CANNOTANSWER said wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,1,>I think the government is the best at protecting the people.
2,1,"'There is a lot of information available online about how the government treats the medical profession in various ways, from the people involved to the people themselves.'"
6,1,The CDC needs to change their policies to avoid the CDC removing all public access to information on the internet.
7,1,I'm a lawyer and i love it so I am in school. I am a lawyer and I do my best to avoid having to work in a hospital or a school setting with people without a health insurance.
11,1,A government made a big deal of the fact that a man wearing a mask can have the flu to protect himself from the virus.
13,1,No he doesn't. There is a huge gap between the tarot and tarot cards and the US government believes that they are both fake and that they are a scam.
18,1,...Isn't that the whole point of a prank?
33,1,"i think the best way to say it, and I'll leave it at that."
41,1,That's kind of funny.
52,1,The CDC is a sexist cult of the tarot.
53,1,I don't think the government is doing anything good in regards to preventing HIV/AIDS.
61,1,A tarot deck is a tarot deck. You’re gonna be fucked.
64,1,The CDC is trying to get people to wear a mask in the name of preventing HIV/AIDS. That's not a scam.
78,1,... You know it's just a joke?
82,1,It's not a scam. It's a fake tarot card that tells people that it's not a scam because if people are infected with the AIDS virus they're on risky territory.
95,1,"The first joke was 'The man who got the virus was the only one. There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is.'"
2,1,"[I'm sorry, but I've been thinking it was just some 'funny joke' about the whole thing. It seems like a joke that people are going to think that it's a scam."
6,1,Vaccination does not protect against the spread of an AIDS virus. It has no effect on the spread of AIDS.
7,1,They're not scams at all.
11,1,"The second one is a bit gimmicky. There is a little bit of red flags relating to people being able to use their masks, I think, to get their attention, and then just a little bit of a slight snideness to get their attention."
13,1,The article was actually a joke. People don't even know it's fake.

78,1,Why should people not put masks on? Are you saying if it is a joke that people don't have a phobia to protect themselves?
82,1,What does it say on the title?
95,1,"""The government has made up a story of what happened. I haven't even seen that movie."""
2,1,...and they're both going to do exactly that! The whole thing is a joke.
6,1,"That's funny, I'm sorry."
7,1,"I think the reason a mask is not a joke is because people don’t know how to read a joke. You can’t go to a hospital and read the joke, that’s the joke. And you can’t say that’s a joke, it’s just a joke."
11,1,Is that all that's about?
13,1,I think the problem is that a lot of the jokes I've read on here are actually actually real. There's some good shit on the internet about the US.
18,1,"This is the most appropriate answer. I'm going to go on and on about the CDC's job, but I am the only person who can think it's a joke."
33,1,The CDC and the FSA want to ban tarot cards.
41,1,"There's literally nothing wrong with wearing a mask. I mean, he's not actually a doctor or a lawyer, and this isn't actually a joke. It's just a way to avoid a conversation and to avoid a negative conversation with the person who's actually in your situation."
52,1,"If a doctor has endorsed a vaccine and you get sick without a mask, I think it's a joke. I've been going through this a lot of times and the first time I heard someone say that they can't have a vaccine is because they got sick because a vaccarian thought the fad was being abused and the government was being manipulated to the point where they didn't know how to use it."

82,1,> The CDC isn't allowed to use tarot cards. They are making a public declaration that it's a scam. They are trying to make it clear that they are not scammers.
95,1,They make up jokes all the time about the government. They don't seem like they have any real reason to.
2,1,It's the'real' version of a tarot card. It's a joke.
6,1,The CDC doesn't have the power to ban a tarot card. They are not in control.
7,1,Vaccination is an antiviral drug. It's one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,1,"This is a terrible joke, and the US government will probably go after the guy who was wearing a mask for a couple months before going after the guy with a mask."
13,1,The government doesn't exist unless it gets some pity or a sarcastic laugh. That's really not true at all.
18,1,I think you're making an unpopular assumption about that. I think it's funny to assume that the government is a bad idea and doesn't see the joke as a joke.
33,1,CANNOTANSWER:
41,1,"I agree with the other comments here, but I've never been in a situation where I don't think the government really cares."
52,1,"People just want to keep it simple, a healthy and well-researched, unbiased opinion of the government and the people they trust. Trying to suck a joke for a few days is not going to change the way you think."
53,1,They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
61,1,"I think the CDC is putting their money in people who don't wear masks based on the facts and not facts. They've already done something. They're putting people on a mask, but they're going to have to have a different approach."
64,1,"I mean, there's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm in college."
78,1,I think I may be confused. Do you have any questions about the joke?
82,1,"Yes, but I haven't been in the medical profession for 20 years."
95,1,"CANNOTANSWER: CANNOTANSWER: ""We have made up a story about how the government is using the mask to combat AIDS. It's a classic."
2,1,I think it's a joke.
6,1,"""It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."", ""Wearing a mask on a flight is not a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus."
7,1,I don't see why a sarcastic joke was made.
11,1,"...but the joke is just a joke, and you shouldn't make a joke."
13,1,I believe this is what happened.
18,1,"There are several CDC guidelines for pranks and other schemes. One of them enables doctors to make a decision, or at least not in order to prevent any new HIV infections."
33,1,"> The first line of the title says that it's not a joke because it's a spoof of the actual tarot card, and there is a lot of conspiracy stuff going on there."
41,1,"In fact, I would say that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus, and because it's a joke, it's a scam."
52,1,It sounds like a joke. He's trying to make a joke about the whole thing. It's a joke about the whole thing.
53,1,"This isn’t funny at all, it’s just an issue you’re trying to resolve."
61,1,"No, it's not a joke."
64,1,"[The article is really good, but I'm going to give some context as to why the title was ""a lot of the way he screamed it out""', ""I've heard that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus, and the same thing as a mask helps prevent people from dying. You're telling the truth, it does, and it helps prevent people from dying. I think the biggest problem isn't how long it's been in use. There's no reason to wear a mask, ""If I'm going to"
78,1,"The joke is: ""Didn't you know that I'm not a good ol' guy, but I thought it was a joke?"
82,1,"Vaccination is not a scam. It's part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a scam because it's illegal for the US to require people to wear tarot cards to get their hands on a fake vaccine, which is a joke. It's a scam because it's illegal for the US to require people to wear tarot cards to get their hands on a fake vaccine, which is a scam."
95,1,What's the joke? CANNOTANSWER:
2,1,i feel like i have some snarky phrasing in this but not all. i just thought that the article was pretty ridiculous and you should read it instead. but when you read it on the internet the whole thing seems pretty ridiculous.
6,1,"The joke that was made was that it was a joke about the health of the public, not about vaccinations. There is a difference between being an immigrant and being a doctor."
7,1,I'm not sure you're a lawyer.
11,1,"I'm not a big fan of the narcissistic humor, but I love the joke."
13,1,"The joke is just a joke, it's not like you were one of the first people to know what is in your mouth that is important for me. It's actually not just a joke. It's a joke. The joke is not true because there is no evidence."
18,1,"This is what makes a joke funny. The CDC is suing the guy who made the mask to get the money back. The real problem isn't that it's a joke, but that the government is trying to influence people. AIDS is not a serious disease. Vaccination is not a serious disease. Vaccination is not a scam."
33,1,The only thing I can think of is that the CDC and the FSA want to ban tarot cards.
41,1,"I think they've been working on a similar thing. The government is trying to stop people from getting the vaccine, but the health care costs are going to be soaring so the government is trying to give them something to look forward to and make people feel better."
52,1,There is a lot of material pointing out that it's part of the government's plan to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
53,1,I think it's a joke.
61,1,>I'm a doctor.
64,1,"I think that's kind of the point of the article. I thought the title was funny, I thought you were taking it literally."
78,1,"AIDS and the CDC both have very specific concerns. Specifically, why is that the first post?"
82,1,I've been a doctor and a doctor for over 20 years. I know a few of the people who used to be the CDC and the media.
95,1,They make up jokes all the time about the government. It's a joke and the government has no right to take advantage of it.

6,1,Vaccination is actually good for people with HIV infection. You just can't stop the spread.
7,1,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
11,1,It's not funny or a joke.
13,1,It sounds like a joke and it is not a scam.
18,1,He's not playing a joke on the CDC because he didn't say that the mask was a joke.
33,1,>It seems to me like some of these people are in the US who are actually trying to change the way we know about vaccines. I am not sure how far this will go.''
41,1,"I'm a doctor, and I think the ""complaining is a joke"" / ""complaining"" section is an appropriate way of reading, and this is an actual joke."
52,1,"If this was a joke, why would we be trying to hide our truth from you, or the American people?"
53,1,It is a joke. Its a joke because it's not legal to give out vaccine to everyone because of a joke.
61,1,"I’ve always found this joke to be funny because I don’t like it. But I am very, very impressed by it."
64,1,"If you haven't been told to wear a mask, then I don't know what you can do with it."
78,1,This is an example of a very incredibly depressing phenomenon.
82,1,You have to get tested and vaccinated to stop the spread of AIDS. So that's a lot of times a scam.
95,1,"The CDC. It is supposed to protect the public, and that's not what it is. So there is a lot more to it."
2,1,"The article is about a health care provider making an appointment with the CDC in a state that is a safe place to get a virus vaccination, and a group of doctors are talking about this with the CDC, who essentially outlines the risks of the program and will be doing all the research on how to prevent the spread of a disease."
6,1,The thing that's so sexist in a few weeks that it seems like people are getting upvotes for it.
7,1,"The people who are wearing the masks do not get sick, so a joke is a joke. That's why they are not gonna fuck with the CDC and the CDC will have to do something about it to keep people from being sick, and it is a joke."
11,1,"If you want to avoid the jokes, then you've got something. You're talking about the mask that is actually really bad for your health and not the human health that was being harmed."
13,1,"You have a point, you can't really be a doctor without a tarot card."
18,1,The CDC is suing the guy who made the mask to get the money back.
33,1,"It's just a joke, you could be saying ""you don't even have to give me a hat to stop AIDS?"" and that would be a joke."
41,1,Vaccination is a scam. The government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They are trying to convince people to get vaccinated. They are trying to make people think they are doing the right thing. The government is trying to make people think they are doing the right thing.
52,1,I'm a Republican and I've never heard of the CDC.
53,1,I just read the whole article a while ago. The joke didn't even resemble the actual joke but you mentioned the joke. I don't know how to describe this.
61,1,"And I'm a doctor, I know a lot of people that do not wear a mask and don't know how to use it. It's a prank and a scam."
64,1,"""[He's trying to get people to have the money for them to go into the hospital and if it does the trick, the insurance companies will make a false claim."""
78,1,'Had I lost my mask?'
82,1,People are buying tarot cards and not actually doing a lot of research on the issue.
95,1,You are probably referring to the person that is trying to avoid stomping in your home.
2,1,"I think it's a great idea, to get them to put a mask on. But I don't think you get it. There are a lot of misconceptions about the government in the world, that the media has been able to hide this, that even the press has resorted to trying to discredit the president, so the media is redirected to that side. There are a ton of sexist and anti-government posters out there who make jokes about the government, so you might want to get that the most common jokes aren't going to happen"
6,1,I'm going to give a quick and easy answer: You are not being serious. You can't stop the disease and prevent its spread.
7,1,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. The government has to take steps to stop this kind of accident.
11,1,I think that the CDC does not have a law against putting a mask on a man's head as it is a joke.
13,1,"...the biggest scam I've heard so far. The thing about using a mask is that it's a way of hiding viruses from the public."", ""Making a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things."", ""The most important part of the joke isn't being a joke. "", ""Has"
18,1,>It's funny to assume that the government is a bad idea and doesn't see the joke as a joke. The real problem isn't that it's a joke
33,1,It's been an interesting time for me to think about the concept of hats. I have not seen a hat that has been used on a hat. It's not a joke. It isn't a joke.
41,1,I've been in a lot of jokes and a lot of the jokes about supersprowers have a joke about how a virus if caught and the government being trying to kill it is a joke. Vaccination is a scam. The CDC and the government are trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with it.
52,1,"The CDC is a sexist cult. Is that what you mean by ""joke""?"

61,1,Vaccines are not an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus.
64,1,"A mask is a very common virus, and it helps prevent the spread of the virus."
78,1,"""If it's not a joke, it's a joke,"""
82,1,I think that your comment is misleading. It’s not a scam. It’s a scam. It’s not a scam. They are trying to make it clear that they are not scammers and not doing what they are asking for.
95,1,CANNOTANSWER: ''I'm really glad it's a movie instead of a joke.
2,1,"I can tell you from my experience that the CDC is a joke. Apparently the tarot card is so much more popular than the real tarot, and a lot of it is about the health care system."
6,1,I think the joke here is about the CDC using fake tarot cards to make sure people don't have to worry about their health because of a certain issue or vaccine.
7,1,The article is confusing. The government has to take steps to stop this kind of accident.
11,1,"> ""...but the joke is just a joke. It’s just a joke, and it’s not funny."""
13,1,The one time you saw me wearing a mask and talking to me in front of the camera... It was just the hysterical bit and he wanted a real card for the rest of us.

53,1,Vaccination is a joke because it’s not legal to give out vaccines to everybody because of a joke. There are a lot of jokes about it and if there is anything wrong with them I think that’s the wrong word.
61,1,A mask is not a joke. A tarot deck is a joke.
64,1,"I've been tarot player and doctor, but I don't know what I'd do with my mask."
78,1,I would say it's a joke. It's like if you said something is a joke in the tarot that was to be laughed at.
82,1,They need to get tested and vaccinated. And they can't do the same for someone who is having AIDS.
