78,56,The best thing I have ever done was to not wear a mask all the time!
83,56,I've never been to a WV event where I was not vaccinated and then I went to a WV event that did not have mandates. But at least they took care of that.

56,4,The problem is that wearing a mask doesn't allow you to get a mask and not be in a position to do that. It doesn't prevent a virus from spreading. Putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things.

74,56,I have no idea how you haven't learned that the government hasn't done anything that's not going to be able to do...
78,56,I want to say this: you should be ashamed of yourself for the first time in your life The best thing I have ever done was to not wear a mask all the time!
83,56,"> You say you can hate it if the state does not have a mandate? That's not funny. The article mentions it as something that only a politician can make a public appearance. The CDC has a list of all the mandatory mandatory medical devices for vaccinating the population that have vaccinated you in order to be vaccinated. Unless you have a health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask, or to have a health insurance that you can wear while you're vaccinated."
84,56,"They aren't using a mask to stop the spread of a virus. A mask for your head can't be worn to go through restaraunts, and is ineffective unless you are infected. You can only do it when you aren't feeling comfortable."
56,4,"You have to wear a mask to get the virus out, not to wear a mask to walk through the restaraunt. If you are vaccinated, then you must not have a mask on, so the CDC has no mandate to provide you with a mask."
56,19,"I’m a doctor, and I had to go to work to get it removed."
74,56,"The issue isn't a mask, it's a helmet. The problem is that a mask has to be used by the government to stop a virus. A mask is basically a shirt with the puck attached to it."
78,56,You need to know why the people are talking about it.
83,56,Vaccination is a fucked up thing.
84,56,"I think you're in the US, right? You can go see people who are vaccinated."
56,4,"I have to wear a mask to get the virus out, not to wear a mask to walk through a restaraunt. If you are vaccinated, then you must not have a mask on, so the CDC has no mandate to provide you with a mask."
56,19,"> I’m not sure if this actually works."","
74,56,I am a little sad about the guy. I think he is taking a bit of responsibility for a little bit of time.
78,56,A lot of things have become stupid to people with a mask. I think the one with the mask is a bit of a prick
83,56,They use a mask to protect people from the spread of a virus. Unless you have health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask.
84,56,"As someone with an HIV-positive family, I can tell you that the virus doesn't exist in the USA. The people I know who were vaccinated in the U.S. did not go to the hospital that isn't infected. They just don't understand the situation well."
56,4,Is this the type of person you’re talking about? Is it the type that you would have a very difficult time with? Or maybe it’s a gimmick?
56,19,"> ""A mask has to be used by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,56,"I think a mask is a good way to stop a virus. It's just like a hat and a hat is just a shirt, and it's the same thing. It's actually a mask."
78,56,It doesn't sound like I've had a problem with it. Just a lot of problems with it.
83,56,"The article says that it is ""part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Is the government going to be able to get vaccines into our state?"", ""Is there a difference between a 'hilarity' story and a 'love' story?"
84,56,"I don't really understand why the US does it, but I'd suggest getting your kids a mask to wear if they can. As a kid who has a lot of allergies and hasn't got it, a mask is really good because they're not really feeling comfortable in public."
56,4,I’m gonna go for the prick.
56,19,"A mask for your head can't be worn to go through restaraunts, and is ineffective unless you are infected. You have to wear a mask to get the virus out, not to wear a mask to walk through the restaraunt. If you are vaccinated, then you must not have a mask on, so the CDC has no mandate to provide you with a mask."
74,56,It's very different from wearing a mask under a helmet. The only difference is how much I like the idea of a mask.
78,56,"As someone who was caught in the past with a mask, it seems like a weird idea. It's creepy, but it's not a fake. Seems like the government is working on an issue."
83,56,I feel like that's a pretty good thing. Vaccination is a very important part of the prevention and protection of the people in need of the vaccine. I don't think it's as much about the actual fact that it's what it is. It's a tool to prevent other diseases. It's just a way to give people protections.
84,56,"> As a kid who has a lot of allergies and hasn't got it, a mask is really good because they're not really feeling comfortable in public. I would have to say that I am very shocked and embarrassed that this is going on. I've had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus. This is actually not true. If you wear a mask for sleep, you have to show an instructor what it means. It’s just a big deal."
56,4,"I'd say that most people aren't comfortable with it. 'By wearing a mask, I can get it out'"
56,19,"I’m so tired of people saying these things but I get it. I have a lot of allergies, but my kids are infected. I have the snorts to help. I put on a mask to protect my kids if I need one. I need it to help the kids in need. Vaccination is the most important part of stopping the spread of a virus. They don’t want it to continue to appoint the vaccine to them. They don’t want to be resentment. And I don’t have any problem with the idea"
74,56,"I don't see what you're doing here but the idea of a mask would make for a prank or a joke. It doesn't exist in any country. It doesn't even happen. If I were president and I was wearing a mask i wouldn't be wearing it, i wouldn't want to leave my hat there if I couldn't see my face."
78,56,"> The first time I saw someone with a mask was when I went to a movie theater and got caught. One time, I was a sailor."
83,56,Is the CDC going to let everyone with no vaccine get vaccinated? Probably not. I wonder if that's an indication that they have enough insurance coverage.
84,56,"Vaccinations don't have to be necessary. The government has to ensure that children get vaccinated properly and they are covered properly. So they're going to need to make sure that the vaccines do not faze their children into giving the false impression they are being vaccinated for, allowing them to avoid exposure."
56,4,This is like the only way to prevent a flu epidemic: get some airway protection
56,19,"The thing that really gets me is that, as a teenager who didn't get vaccinated, people always wear masks because it’s hard to believe."

83,56,This is the right thing to say. The article is sexist.
84,56,"> I’ve had several people say that wearing a mask in public is dumb, because it's not necessary to prevent a virus."
56,4,We've got to get them vaccinated.
56,19,It's ridiculous because it's a hysterical. It is a very hysterical idea.
74,56,"I'm really surprised the government is trying to stop it, because it seems to make more sense for a president to wear a mask that's not made to stop the spread of AIDS."
78,56,"I have this mask as an extra precaution. The most likely reason to have it, would be to protect yourself from it, but if you don't want to, you'd better wear it anyway."
83,56,I don't see how a person who isn't vaccinated does not know what they're doing. This is not about vaccines. The CDC's plan was to vaccinate someone but I feel like they need to get something in place unless they have the money.
84,56,You are going to need to use this subreddit to make yourself more understandable.
56,4,It is a sexist idea. The article is not the proper one.
56,19,"The idea is that it would make for a prank or joke, and the article makes it more of a prank than it is a joke."
74,56,"They don't make a good joke about it but rather a joke that the president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus. ""I am a Canadian, and I don't like a mask. I'd like a hat for some reason. Having one on the game doesn't seem to be a good idea. I'm going to have to try it! It's my life to eat some burgers when I go to a sports bar.

I think it's an unfortunate thing to be putting people in a position to protect themselves, and it may not be a good idea to do that."
74,56,"The CDC is working to help prevent the spread of AIDS, but they're going to be a good team. They won't be able to stop the spread of AIDS. They can't even use a mask. It's a mask that prevents an outbreak."
78,56,It's a joke. Those are all ridiculous.

74,56,"The CDC is working to prevent the spread of AIDS. The president and his friends are talking about the issue of AIDS. It sounds like a prank. It's just a way to make a joke, and it is a joke. It is a joke, and it is a joke. It is a joke, and it is no joke."
78,56,"[NAME] was one of the people who cried when she found out that ""We should get a doctor to stop HIV""."
83,56,"People can hate the government and don't go to a health party to be vaccinated, so they'll take all their medicine."
84,56,He is just trying to make the country safer for everyone.
56,4,It is a joke that's funny for me but not for me.
56,19,AIDS/Brideshwinfs. They're a bunch of guys that use it because AIDS flies and you get vaccinated. You don't wear a mask for a lot of different reasons. If you don't get a vaccinated you are only going to wear a mask to protect yourself. You're going to take a mask out to protect yourself.
74,56,"So what if you put a mask on a hockey team? Unless they wear a mask, which is a prank, you haven't really had a helmet on your teammates, it won't be a prank?"
78,56,"OP, you are right that a mask is a gimmick that it should not be worn."
83,56,I’d like to thank the folks at r/epiphany for pointing this out.
84,56,">They aren’t using a mask to stop the spread of a virus.It is not illegal, if not illegal, but the government is obligated to make it possible for people to get their kids to get their vaccination."
56,4,"It's a joke, and it is no joke. It is not a prank or joke. It is a joke."
56,19,I'm sure the joke would come off as a joke and the CDC would presumably be looking for a way to stop the spread of a virus.
74,56,A prank that only works because the president wore a mask is a joke if you're not really interested in it.
78,56,There is a lot to be said about people with masks. The CDC has to stop spreading the AIDS and that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of AIDS.
83,56,"""I've been to over 50 countries, and it's definitely a good idea."""
84,56,They don't have to use it. Vaccines are not the way to stop the spread of HIV. They are a good way to prevent HIV and prevent it.
56,4,"I was in the CDC for a couple of months and the article just came out saying it was ""sexist"". I wasn't even aware it was a joke."
56,19,Vaccines are a good way to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not a good way to prevent it and are a great way to help prevent it.

56,4,"I'm sorry to say, but your username makes this so funny for you."
56,19,A prank is something a lot of people don't think of - a prank is a joke. It's like a prank about a person that gets the sick of a baby in the hospital - and it's a joke because they are able to feel the fear and guilt of it. Whether that's what it is or not is irrelevant.
74,56,"This is the first time I have heard this joke and it made me feel better. It's really not a joke, it's a joke."
78,56,"The CDC is in a position to prevent AIDS, and it's not going to stop that. The CDC also has not put a focus on treating AIDS or the prevention of it. The CDC is not interested in preventing HIV. They're just putting out a big push to stop the spread of it."
83,56,It was only the first time in the history of AIDS that a doctor had to be vaccinated before he became a public figure. The CDC had to have a list of all mandatory medical devices for vaccinating people.
84,56,Vaccinations don’t have to be necessary. The government has to ensure that children get vaccinated properly and they are covered properly.

He lost that mask a lot because he could've got an AIDS cd, and that's not something that a joke at"
83,56,>The article mentions it as something that only a politician can make a public appearance. The CDC has a list of all mandatory medical devices for vaccinating the population that have vaccinated me in order to be vaccinated. Unless you have a health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask.

You may need a helmet to help protect yourself and to help the children in need. Vaccination is the most important part of stopping the spread of a virus."
74,56,There are still a lot of examples of jokes being made about it:
78,56,That's what people say. The CDC has no role in making people understand the whole thing - they use it as an excuse to do nothing. This is the way you're being explained. Especially the guy who was caught with a mask in the past. He thought it was joke because the CDC is not in a position to prevent the spread of AIDS. He was lying about the AIDS hive mind. It was actually just a joke. They didn't know the hive mind had AIDS so I have no problem with it and will not wear it.

78,56,"I'm not a doctor but I still haven't seen a prank about anything with an AIDS mask. I think the problem is that there aren't many answers. The more I look at it, the more I find that the hive mind sounds more like a joke than a real joke."
