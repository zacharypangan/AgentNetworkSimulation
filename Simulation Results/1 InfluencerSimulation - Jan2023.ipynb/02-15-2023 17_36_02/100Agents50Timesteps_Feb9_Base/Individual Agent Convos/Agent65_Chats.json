    "I like to wear a mask to walk through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask and then taking it off when i get to my table. I don't want to be seen in the crowd. I do want to be around people. I do want to be around people. I do. I do, but I don't want to be around people. This is a joke",
    "I don't know why people would have a problem letting a hive come to them unless the hive is there. They can't tell that a hive doesn't belong in a mask and will just run away from it and leave with no hives.",
    "The one here says that the guy is trying to make the public feel uncomfortable, because the article's the one where he wants to be a joke and the article says that the jingle is a joke, but isn't a joke. It's just a joke. It's a joke. The joke isn't that it's a joke, it's that it's a joke because the jingle is a joke. It's a joke, because the jingle isn't funny."
