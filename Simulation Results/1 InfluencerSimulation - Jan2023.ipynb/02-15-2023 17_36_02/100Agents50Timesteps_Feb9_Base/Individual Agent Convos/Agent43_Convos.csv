92,43,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
43,7,They also have a lot of money that is aimed at preventing an illness.

43,22,"I was there, and if that's what you mean."
43,25,The people who got masks from the government for vaccinating themselves with a virus are in a very different situation than the people who were there this weekend.
43,34,What if they say that a government is putting a mask on the people who do need it. Do they have a mandate to not wear a mask at all?

This whole thing is a scam."
52,43,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,43,This is a relic I read recently in the News. Is it true or is it just speculation?
92,43,That is pretty naive. My best friend lost her mask after going out of the door without it. She had never even met her husband before. She's been in her early 30s and he's got a lot of stuff in her hands. She even said that the only thing that he does when she's in the hospital is to put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt. She doesn't want to go through the restaraunt with it. She was just looking to get it to the hospital. The mask isn't a scam
43,7,"It says it's a scam. It's a scam, but I think it might be true."
43,16,> 'They also have a lot of money that is aimed at preventing an illness.
43,22,"So, this is a scam. That's what's happening in the US."
43,25,I can't help but remember how many times people have gone to the police in the US that would have been very happy to have had their doctor's help. I'm going to guess that there are a lot of people on the news here who know nothing about vaccinating themselves.
43,34,"I would put on a mask and walk down the street with my face on to prevent my body from ripping off, and also get my eyes closed on the face. I bleed like a dead cat and have to wear a mask when i am in the ER."
52,43,">I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want' to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want' to wear a mask to protect my children'."
55,43,"There are plenty of other states that mandate people to wear masks. There are in the states as well, but in Connecticut it's not a federal law."
92,43,"It was a scam, but I believe the CDC said they have an actual health evaluation that tells them to go back on the prescription."
43,7,"My med students are very concerned about whether or not the CDC has a mandate to wear a mask. In the first place, it's because it is the one's that are supposed to be kept at the hospital. But when you put it on, you'll know if it's a scam."
43,16,"I'm not a lawyer but I'm a lawyer. What about a person who has lost a mask? If it's not a scam, and a scumbag who has lost his a mask, it can't be a scam."
43,22,"In other words, they are not a scam."
43,25,There are plenty of other states that mandate people to wear masks.
43,34,This is really just speculation. How does this work? Do the two people who are wearing a mask know about it are a scam?
52,43,Well you're being sexist.
55,43,"My doctor told me that, when he asked why we would not wear a mask, he swore it. He got so mad at him about it, that he resorted to wearing a mask instead. It was very incredibly disgusting."
92,43,"i'm sure they would do the same shit for me. If you're going to do it, you're going to have to get a mask. You'll need to get an accutane, shave your dick, and put on a mask and keep wearing it. What do you mean ""put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt""? Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to the table is a lot more complicated"
43,7,Isn't that just being a relic of a relic? I'm not sure what is coming to you here.
43,16,The fact that someone who lost their mask is an idiot is just a very odd coincidence. It's not really a scam. There aren't enough insurances. The only thing that matters is the insurance company. Is there a way they could protect them without having to be aware of the risks that they are exposed to.
43,22,">The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't know the name of the man in a mask but I have a friend who has lost his face mask to the IRS and he screamed out ""I lose a mask at least four times a day."
43,25,Vaccinating yourself isn't a crime in the US. It is a medical treatment. You're not getting an accutane and shave your dick.
43,34,"I've got a friend who has a mask in his bed, and a med student who lives in the city with her parents. She has a very low risk of contracting a virus. She goes through a medical center and gets the mask on to keep it from being taken away in the hospital if it gets stolen.

Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"
55,43,">In my opinion if someone says this to me a lot, it's very likely a scam and it's just not a real thing, so I'm not sure what to say."
92,43,*I lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
43,7,I would get the mask from someone I knew in high school or college. That is why they have to cover themselves in their own health insurance.

43,25,In a very specific situation the mask issue is really being discussed.

52,43,The joke has to be a lot about the real world as opposed to the actual fact that it's actually a good idea.

92,43,"I don't understand why people think that this is a scam. I was told by my family that you can't fake the fact that you've lost a mask because you didn't know it existed.

43,16,"I can't really remember the exact details of this but I'm looking at it as ""you guys's mask."""
43,22,That's what happened. I'm in the US. And I'm not saying this is a scam. I'm saying that there are a lot of people in America who don't have a real job or live in a country where the gov't can get their head out of a shit.
43,25,I know what you mean but a lot of people in this sub aren't in any way trying to discredit the actual reality that this is a scam. Especially when it comes to this kind of thing.
43,34,I'm not sure I can imagine how much of a joke this is... I know.
52,43,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children.''"
55,43,"It is an indefensible thing to do. I'm a federal worker. My job is to prevent people from going to any public health events. If you do not like it, you can have a twitchcon.

92,43,I'm not sure what you're talking about.
43,7,I'm a federal worker and there are a lot of people out there who think it's a scam.
43,16,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children.'"
43,22,There is a legitimate question.
43,25,"You are going to eat in my mouth for a minute here, and I m not going to laugh at you. I'm going to talk to a doctor about how they feel. I am sure that there is no way you are going to get a job out of your mask. I am sure you will."
43,34,There is not any real rule about who wears a mask or who does not. I'm going to assume that you're talking about a scam. I mean you need a mask to take care of yourself. Vaccination is a medical treatment.
52,43,I think the first thing you noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind and not actually the part that has to be made up.
55,43,>Is your doctor wearing a mask in the US?
92,43,> The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
43,7,I'm from Florida and I live in California and have only ever seen it on tv. There is a lot of shit that happens out there. There is not a single video on the internet where someone is claiming to be a medical doctor who wears a mask.
43,16,"""It is a scam. It is an indefensible thing to do. I'm not sure what you mean but I'm looking at it as ""you guys's mask."""
43,22,It was just an euphemism for something people don't know or would be willing to do in order to stop the spread of the virus.
43,25,"I'm not sure why this is being discussed in this subreddit, but it's also being argued that there are people who think that this is a scam."
43,34,"In all honesty, I think I've learned to be honest."
52,43,"I'm very, very sorry for your loss."
55,43,"I can't help but think that AIDS is a scam. And this is how we keep from having a racial profiling of someone that actually cares about their health, and it's not like we have to get vaccinated or even have to worry about them being sick. We're doing it with our own money, but I can tell you this is an awful joke."
92,43,It's not a scam. The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is not a scam because it's a serious illness unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
43,7,"This is all in the title - 'Never trust me a government doctor' - ""You guys fucked up."""
43,16,I'm pretty sure the first thing he said was you guys have a mask. He is also claiming to have AIDS. I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it. It doesn't make sense to wear one to protect people who don't wear one but are willing to do it to protect themselves.
43,22,">I am a federal worker. My job is to prevent people from going to any public health events. If you do not like it, you can have a twitchcon."
43,25,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"""
43,34,"Vaccination is a legal and ethical matter, not a sex act. It is not a medical procedure, it is a safety measure, and there is not anything they can do about it. Its a legitimately valid treatment and a medical treatment isn't one of them."
52,43,"The US has done the right thing, because they aren't even remotely Americans, so it's only logical that a few Americans are saying that a hive mind could be a hive mind. It's a funny joke, to have a human face. But it doesn't sound like a joke to them."
55,43,Are you sure it's a scam?
92,43,[This is not a scam](http://www.faq.gov/science/commentary/wbjr/irs)
43,7,"I am a CDC staff member. This isn't about AIDS, it's about the government smuggling AIDS into their office, and the people who wear masks are usually very young. It doesn't make sense that doctors who wear masks aren't actually working at the same level of work as you. There are laws that are supposed to protect people in order to prevent the spread of this AIDS, which isn't really an official word, but the laws are there so that people can choose what to do with their own."
43,16,I'm just gonna add some facts. Vaccination is a legitimate sex and safety measure. They're not going to have the money to fight this.
43,22,It's not a scam. It's not a scam.
43,25,This is a joke. It doesn't sound a scam.
43,34,I think it's just a way for some people to think that AIDS is a scam. I'm very sure it's a scam.
52,43,>I think the first thing you noticed is that he was just pretending to be a hive mind and not actually the part that has to be made up.
55,43,I think a relic I read recently in the News. Is it true or is it just speculation?
92,43,This is the third time I've come across this type of scam. It's a good thing that the CDC is making it sound like it's just a scam.
43,7,People who wear masks aren't people. They are just people who are doing something they don't want to. There are laws out there that will help them and it doesn't seem like a scam.
43,16,I read an article once saying that the CDC's actions against the hive mind were completely fraudulent.
43,22,"You have no idea about the government, nor are you the one with the AIDS, and if he is trying to fool the public into thinking it's a scam, then yes he is."
43,25,It's not a scam. This is a scam. The government has done the right thing.
43,34,"So there are two ways to do this, is to get people to come in and get a hive mind?"
52,43,I'm not going to tell you what I really like to tell you about this nonsense.
55,43,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
92,43,>The fact that they are not fakes are the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
43,7,"I was born in the US and in my family members country, I lived in Georgia. They don't use Medicaid, but they have the option to get them if they want."
43,16,This isn't the first time that I've come across this type of scam.
43,22,"No! That's what I do for a living. I m not sure how to get a hive mind and just the fact that it's a hive mind isn't a scam, so I'm not going to use that to do anything about it."
43,25,What if he is a sick person that goes to the hospital?
43,34,"I feel like you should be asking for more details. It is the scam. It is just a ploy to gain access to health care, and if you are ill and sick you are going to need to have a face mask. They are basically a way for the government to gain access to health care that doesn't include AIDS. It isn't just a scam. It is actually something that can be injected into a system of sex."
52,43,"I read this and was like, ""Fresh fuck me and I'm going to keep up the nonsense!"""
55,43,I don't know if this is true but it's very likely that the CDC has some reason to fear you not going to a public health event with your mask.
92,43,"I feel like I owe you a lot. I'm not going to be doing a scam anymore, I'm not going to get a good job."
43,7,This is all part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS.I think it's just a way for some people to think that AIDS is a scam. I'm very sure it's a scam.
43,16,"I had a friend of mine who lost a hive mind. It's a health care mask, the only way to stop it is to prevent it. He never really used the mask, he'd go through the pain of wearing it, and his mind wouldn't change."
43,22,I have not read a lot of posts claiming that it is a scam. There is nothing wrong with it. The government has done the right thing.
43,25,Vaccination isn't a crime in the US. It is a medical treatment. You are not getting an accutane and shave your dick. Vaccination is not a crime in the US. It is a medical treatment. You're not getting a accutane and shave your dick. Vaccination isn't a crime in the US. Vaccination isn't a crime in the US. It is a scam.
43,34,"I'm not sure I'm going to have any idea if this is a scam or not, but the CDC's actions against the hive mind are completely fraudulent. There is no reason for a mask to be in the ED unless it's being used to control the infection and the health of the person, who can't use it to fight disease or die in a situation where it's unlikely to be injected into the system of sex. If it is a scam, then yes it is."
52,43,"""I think they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it. It's the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone."""
55,43,I don't see how the people who said that are still trolls are not real people.
92,43,"I'm a doctor and a professional in the medical field, so this sounds like a scam."
43,7,"This is the type of thing that I see on the news, and people do it so often. In my experience, if a medical doctor was trying to prevent an infection and get the patient in to their office, he'd likely be on the hook for a mask and some type of medication."
43,16,Vaccination is a serious health-care problem and I am not a lawyer but my favorite person to talk to as a doctor is someone who lost their hive mind.
43,22,"""In other words, they are not a scam. So, this is a scam. That's what's happening in the US."""
43,25,"This isn't a scam, this is a scam."
43,34,I feel like I'm going to have to do this. This is how I know I know I am the person in my life.
52,43,"Well if you're thinking of the whole ""hive mind joke,"" you have to think about how it's actually a joke, but it's a joke."
55,43,Why are the people who say that are still trolls?
92,43,Then I went to the CDC's office and they're the only ones you can get to work with.
43,7,It has nothing to do with AIDS.
43,16,"I read it as ""Mask me to wear a mask and stop having to die and infect others."""
43,22,"My job is to prevent people from going to public health events. If you do not like it, you can have a twitchcon."
43,25,So we've got the CDC for this:

43,7,"The problem is that you don't have an attorney, because you are not a lawyer. That's not your problem."
43,16,The CDC has no interest in changing the laws. They are making it seem like it's a criminal act.

43,25,"This is the whole reason why the FDA can't vaccinate a person. If it's actually a medical treatment. If they don't cover it up and can't get you to use a sex sex one, then nope."
43,34,The CDC is a huge fraud.
52,43,I would be surprised if a few people in the US made a joke about wearing a mask.
55,43,"It seems that this was a joke, not a joke."
92,43,"Vaccination is a scam because you cannot go through a restaraunt without being vaccinated. If you are an AIDS patient, you can get a vaccination to prevent AIDS from spread. The same applies to people who use a rash mask to prevent AIDS from spreading."
43,7,"As a former doctor in Florida, I can tell you that the government is trying to suck on my case. I just hope the public doesn't make it a joke about the government. I've heard the government do it to prevent HIV/AIDS but it won't stop people from getting their treatment."
43,16,The FDA will pay your doctor for your life and the CDC will pay your shit back.
43,22,It's a fake joke. It's a scam.
43,25,"Is the government a scam? I mean, there are more CDCs than the US. It isn't legal for anyone not to be vaccinated."
43,34,"Is there any possibility that you'll be legally able to get vaccinated? If not, the government isn't a big enough thing to stop you."
52,43,"I was about to say that I think the joke isn't funny, but it's a joke. The joke isn't a joke. They've made up stories, but it seems to me they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it."

92,43,A lot of people have been scammed. You can get a vaccine without going through the restaraunt. You can get a vaccination for AIDS without going through the restaraunt. You can't go through a restaraunt without being vaccinated. But if you go through a restaraunt. You can't have a rash. A mask. That's the kind of thing that can make you do something that's a flop.
43,7,You have to leave the state. I have no idea what the article is about and why it is an untrue story. The government has a legitimate policy of having you covered in the hospital by not having your passport with them. The fact that they are threatening you is proof that the government is attempting to sabotage your treatment.

55,43,I'm going to cite the name of the person that made the mask for a joke.
92,43,"Vaccination is not a scam. It is because it doesn't affect the virus growth. AIDS is. But it is a serious disease. This is an extremely dangerous disease. It may be a scam, but it is not a scam."

43,16,"""The problem is that you don't have an attorney, because you are not a lawyer."""
43,22,There is a lot more going on in these comments than this one.
43,25,"This is a scam. If you want to get vaccinated and get a mask, you have to wear it. You can get a CDC to put on a mask, but that's not how it works. You could get a government mandate that prevents it, or you could use it to kill people to get an AIDS vaccine. You can get a legitimate prescription, but it's a scam."
43,34,"The entire CDC (the CDC) has misinformation about AIDS. They have zero interest in preventing AIDS, they have zero interest in preventing it. They also don't have a mandate to provide the information about AIDS, nor do they want to protect it."
52,43,">I read this as ""We are the only people who do not want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want' to wear a mask to protect my children.'"
55,43,This isn't the best way to tell the story of an actual joke that actually happened.
92,43,"There's a story about a smuggler attempting to scare the public into buying the vaccine, it's just that if it gets into their hands and they want to help get the disease under control, they can do it."
43,7,"They're not scams, they're not scams."
43,16,'What if someone who lost their mask is an idiot?
43,22,"I like your perspective about how I was in a state of confusion over a mask and I want to share that with you, but what is the point in a mask?"
43,25,It is a scam. Alot of people are getting fucked.
43,34,It seems that a lot of people are actually fucking up the CDC a bit. They're just wasting their time in a conspiracy to try and convince the government to do whatever they want. It's a simple joke.
52,43,">We are the only people who do not want to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children.'',"
55,43,"As a public health defender, I agree with your sentiments on the CDC's role in preventing HIV transmission and the use of twitchcon, and also your personal statement about this, including not having to pay any compensation, is a joke. I would make a statement stating that you can't make up your mind and that you are not a good person for being in a public health sex with a tarot deck. This would give the public another reason to think it's a scam. You can't just go and see what"
92,43,"The point is that a virus is something you might get from a ""masked"" infection in a small space that is not a place to be vaccinated. This is the only other way to stop this. This means you have a vaccine, you are not a virologist, you are the CDC, and you are a virologist."
43,7,"The fact that you know that the CDC has no official authority to charge them for that has made this whole thing a scam. They could still take you out, but don't give them more than a year of your life."
43,16,">How did it work? I said 'I'm not a lawyer, but I'm a lawyer."
43,22,Yes it is a scam. Vaccination is not a crime in the US. It is a legitimate medical procedure. It is not a crime in the US.

52,43,I read that he said he would never wear a mask.
55,43,I can't even read what I read because I am very familiar with twitchcon.
92,43,Vaccination is a scam because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. AIDS is. But it is not a virus.

43,16,No. Vaccination isn't a crime in the US. It is a legitimate medical procedure. It is not a crime in the US.

55,43,The article does not say that he is a prankster.
92,43,They also try to prevent the spread of the virus through medicine. And so it doesn't make sense that they are scamming people.
43,7,"I read a bit of the article. It's a scam, which isn't in any way a joke. I don't care what you think it is a scam, but I can tell you that it's just a lie - and that it's not."
43,16,"I don't think I ever saw the CDC talking to a stranger about this. It's so adolescent. You see, it seems like a scam."
43,22,"This is more about the government helping the spread of the virus, than the government doing something illegal to prevent HIV/AIDS."
43,25,"Not a scam but a medical treatment. It's a legitimate treatment. They aren't denying you a job, they're denying you a job and your family may not care about you."
43,34,The CDC is a cult leader.

43,34,I can tell you that he is an idiot. If you are a fool and you will bleed like a dead cat then this is a scam.
52,43,"You know, to me, it is a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. The jokes that are made are a bit off.
