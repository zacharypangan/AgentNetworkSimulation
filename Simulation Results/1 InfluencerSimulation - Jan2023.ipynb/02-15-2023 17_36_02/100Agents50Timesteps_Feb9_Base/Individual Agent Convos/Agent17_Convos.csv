99,17,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
17,2,"I'm not sure if this is the right answer or if it's just being a ""bad guy"" or the only way to go through it."
17,3,"I lost a mask four times a day, a little less than a week ago."
20,17,I am so sorry Mark but I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere Please wear a mask and bend over another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask
26,17,"You're a child, oh, you're a child."
29,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
30,17,"In that scenario, you'd have to wear a mask. What about a t-shirt?"
37,17,"It’s all too familiar. It was a scam. But as a result of the scandal, I’ve had to put on my mask and make it clear that the NSA wasn’t going to enforce it, or if it was a statewide mandate that is essentially the only thing that happened."
38,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month
41,17,I am so sorry to hear this.
45,17,Masks are worn to protect others from the spread of viruses. They protect the environment. They are used to guard against the spread of those viruses
49,17,"As a guy who grew up in the uk, my friend and I have been getting to play together a few times this summer and they said we would be going to the vaccination booth at a bbq and we were told to put on a mask and wear it on the tv. We also told him that when we were vaccinated, a person would not wear a mask as they could get stuck in a sock and that they would get sick if they did it in the park. I had to wear it in the uk too"
53,17,I believe the official reason that the mask is a helmet was because the government needed to stop this problem from affecting any one player.
70,17,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
74,17,That's just an assumption.
82,17,"He didn't afk, it's just the fact that he didn't wear the mask."
83,17,You can only get mad if you spout off the racial identity of the person who snooped at you while in the park.
90,17,I feel you a little bit better at defining what a mask is compared to a real one - the type of mask that the vaccinated person is supposed to wear when in a normal environment and in a public place - and this is what I would call a mask.
99,17,he's not a scam.
17,2,"You know I've heard about this before, but just a little since I woke up in the middle of nowhere."
17,3,If you haven't already.
20,17,Vaccinated persons in my state usually have to wear a mask to a certain extent.
26,17,Why doesn't everyone get a picture of themselves in the middle of a game? Or do people just go outside when there is a fight? Because people have been told to stop.
29,17,"I mean, if you wear a mask, you can be really uncomfortable, and I'm not sure why. I'd rather be able to wear a mask than I get the idea that I'm being used in a scenario that's more uncomfortable. However, I can't even imagine how uncomfortable you'd be if I were in a position like that."
30,17,You mean you have to wear a mask so that you can have a better night?
37,17,It's kind of weird to me that a mask was used in the Iraq war. The guy used it when he was a kid.
38,17,> i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month 
41,17,... But the only people I know who actually do wear masks are kids and older adults. I am so sorry to hear this.
45,17,"Yes, you are the one whose responsibility is to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by a truck."
49,17,"I don't even know if they could have even attempted this at all, except I'm sure this is the sort of thing where it doesn't make much sense. The government wants to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one. This seems to be a legitimate issue, because in reality, the government isn't interested in making it safer."
53,17,"The question is why you're being ""spooked""?"
70,17,So what do you mean by the way they are trying to stop people from wearing a mask when they are at work?
74,17,"I'm not gonna be the best coach, but if he didn't make this a priority for a long time, he'd be in no position to ever be a coach in my life. It's more likely to happen at the start of the year, but if I were in a coach, I'd have to make sure he wasn't wearing a mask for a while, and to keep his mind off his head."
82,17,...it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,17,Is the CDC reporting that people are vaccinated? It sounds like the CDC is a bit of a joke.
90,17,"I had to have a test done after my vaccination, so I had to get them in the same state of Florida as my bf at my local TWTC in 2007. There's a bunch of guys who don't have it. I haven't tried it in a long time, but i'll take the test."
99,17,Isn't it possible to make a new business with a mask?
17,2,My parents have a helmet. We just wear them for work.
17,3,My employer has a very similar attitude as you. They are making it a lot easier and a lot more effective.
20,17,"I would think it's just a good idea to have them put on a mask, they make it so it's safer, and aren't getting in the middle of the other folks with their masks."
26,17,"Because they are preventing a more effective and safe cure for a virus. In fact, the virus isn't even that big of a deal. It's a simple virus, and it's basically a fecal matter. I'm not saying they are a bad idea but they're a good idea."
29,17,"This was posted in r/Rosevelt. The article is about a man who wears a mask when he's on the field and he's wearing a mask and a mask in a public place, not being able to see in public - I am sure he's a prick, and I'm sure there are people that will think about wearing a mask when they 'carry' it around while they're out and about. He's also in the field with some good news."
30,17,I'm sure you can get over this.
37,17,"I think you're referring to the guy who wore a mask during a fight over a virus, which is what they used to cover people in the war."
38,17,> The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
41,17,What does the government have to do with the virus?
45,17,I lost my first mask once. I don't think it was on purpose.
49,17,I would like to say I'm going to call all the people on here out of respect for their opinion. But I feel bad that a bunch of idiots on here think that you're lying. This is why you don't rn. This is why you don't have a job. Its stupid. It's not your job.
53,17,"I don't understand the idea that ""no"" or ""no"" are all just an idea, and the fact that I don't like to wear a mask and still can't see clearly in the gym and that that he should be able to see clearly. I was a coach in high school. I am a coach and the majority of the people who play in the league don't understand this concept."
70,17,"As a guy with a mask in his office, I have been vaccinated with a phlegm virus. I've never had a problem, and if you're an employee with no mask or something, then you're a criminal."
74,17,Getting a new mask and making a decision about whether or not to continue to wear it is a prank.
82,17,People who don't wear masks are scumbags.
83,17,">You can only get mad if you spout off the racial identity of the person who snooped at me while in the park.', 'Is the CDC reporting that people are vaccinated? It sounds like the CDC is a bit of a joke. I've been to a couple of events and my friend didn't know I was there. I went to the first TWC in a few years and he said he didn't know until I was able to get vaccinated."
90,17,Is that where you're getting your advice? Is that where you're getting your advice? It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are.
99,17,"A fake tarot card that shows that if your friend is a fraud, you'll be out of luck for two weeks or so, right? I know it's a good idea, but I don't think that you're gonna be good at it."
17,2,"i know that sounds a little naive. I know this is not right for me, but my mother used to be a doctor and I figured a mask was really just that. she was wearing a hat when i was little, but not really."
17,3,"So you don't think that's a joke, just that you snooped at you while in the park?"
20,17,"The federal government should've made this a priority. I don't see how the mask is worthless and misleading or misleading. I'm not a fan of the guy, but that's probably a valid point. I'd not go on to argue about his insurance policy. But, I wouldn't say it is a scam, but it's a scam."
26,17,You can have a virus by wearing a mask but it needs to be vaccinated. You can't have a virus by using the mask. It's not a good idea to have a virus by not wearing a mask.
29,17,"> ""The truth is, even if you are vaccinated and you don't have a helmet, you have no protection against the virus. TIL the US has no mandates to protect your face from twitch and a virus. Are you from the states?"
30,17,"Yes, the government is a naive machinist. Vaccination is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus."
37,17,It's called a scam to say that the government is allowing you to wear a mask and not be permitted to leave.
38,17,"We have to be vaccinated for every one of the two types of avian influenzae vaccines, which means they're required to wear them in order to survive. I'm gonna say this about twitchcon and masks... You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates The only thing that can avert the twitch crowd from waking up to my mask. That's a pretty sexist euphemism. The issue with the government has no bearing on it."
41,17,I think he's being critical of the government for not doing something.
45,17,"I have no problem wearing a mask when my parents are not wearing the helmet. I'm a teacher so I can tell you that I can help protect the environment. However, I do agree that it's a big part of helping the government to stop spread of a virus."
49,17,It's not a job. It's stupid. It's not your job.
53,17,He says you need a helmet if you can't see clearly in the gym. He doesn't have a helmet.
70,17,Are you sure that's right? Because it is a whole bunch of crap.
74,17,I think it's possible that you're going to make this sub with a lot of people that are willing to talk to you. Especially if it's a lot of people.
82,17,I don't see why he's a scammer or a scamster. His whole post is about how a fake viral infection is a major societal concern.
83,17,"Well, as someone who has been vaccinated I'm sorry. But I don't think you're too far into the snooping part of the story."
90,17,The government has no mandate. They can't.
99,17,You've been a scammer for years. Your friend is not the one who should be scamming. It's a scam. The tarot card is a scam. This is what the government wants to do. The tarot card is to use the money you've given him. I'm sure it's worthless.
17,2,Vaccination is NOT required in your country to prevent the spread of a virus. It's required for the first time in a million years of public health (e.g. vaccinated people in the country.) If you're not in the US it is a criminal offense.
17,3,I haven't even been vaccinated - a bit of a snoopy comment.
20,17,"Vaccination is just a mask, if you are a smoker, a vaccine is a mask. You can wear it in the same way as your husband, but in the same way that you can wear a mask. This is the only way you should do anything."
26,17,That's a really bad way of talking.
29,17,">I mean, if you wear a mask, you can be really uncomfortable, and I'm not sure why. I'd rather be able to wear a mask than I get the idea that I'm being used in a scenario that's more uncomfortable. However, I can't even imagine how uncomfortable you'd be if I were in a position like that."""
30,17,I'm not sure what it is but some people don't realize this is a thing.
37,17,There's a link somewhere in this thread where the guy in question is joking that he's not a lawyer. Is that a scam? I think it's more like a scam that's based around having a lawyer to pay for the cost of a lawyer.
38,17,"Honestly, if I were a politician, I would wear a mask unless it has a government mandate. If it's not mandated, it wouldn't be a good idea to wear a mask and then wear a mask unless they're mandated by law to wear it. I would just not want to wear a mask."
41,17,It is a sappy way to describe the kind of stuff you would normally wear all day.
45,17,"I didn't ask if this was a joke, I told them to go to a movie about a virus and get it off the game"
49,17,">I would like to say I'm going to call all the people on here out of respect for their opinion. But I feel bad that a bunch of idiots on here think that you're lying. This is why you don't have a job. It's stupid. It's not your job."", ""It's stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. It's not your job."", ""In all honesty, I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on."", ""I'm going to call all the people"
53,17,>What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead. That's a lot of masks.
70,17,">I think I see this as a sign that there is no cure for HIV. That's actually not the CDC. Vaccination isn't a bad idea, but it isn't necessary."
74,17,">The first thing I ever said was ""I love coaching."""
82,17,People who don't wear masks are scumbags.
83,17,"I don't think this is a good story, but i think I have read that a bunch of stuff is a bit like [http://www.cdc.gov/dpr/insecurities/pa.gov/securities/](http://www.cdc.gov/securities/1) I would suggest you read the wikipedia article, because it's pretty great and the first twitchcon that you saw was a big success."
90,17,"I've been on a vaccinatist team - he wore a mask, and it helped prevent a lot of deaths, like from infection, which was a deadly disease. It did not have a mandate, so he said he would wear a mask."
99,17,"> But, I think I was trying to convince my friends with it because they are scammers."
17,2,"Vaccination is a very dangerous thing. As long as people are not infected, they are a crime."
17,3,"The first thing I ever said was ""I love coaching."" People who don't wear masks are scumbags."
20,17,I was talking about the fact that the government is acting in a way that I amn't familiar with.
26,17,"I'm very familiar with the phrase ""I've been wearing a mask every day for almost every event I've been to, and for about a year he goes on a bus to see the other teams. I've had a few dummy masks for my life, but I've found that the ones I'm using are the ones that really hurt."
29,17,The problem is that people don't actually wear a mask. This is how we use jokes like these in the real world.
30,17,"He is the ""one who cares to prevent a problem"" person, so maybe it is the right thing to do."
37,17,">I don't really know how many people have heard of ""I don't really know how many people have heard of ""This is a tidbit of info about how they get vaccines for people who wear them in public. I had to read the article to get to the point of saying ""I'm not gonna go to the restroom. I just want my health back. I'm not comfortable enough with people putting on a mask."""
38,17,Is there a government mandate to shave off your face?
41,17,This guy is a bad friend.
45,17,"I know this is a lot of money to the state, but i can't believe that so many people are saying that the world would not be able to be a better place without a mask."
49,17,"""I'm a man and I want to wear a mask so I don't have to go to the doctor and do it""."
53,17,"It's a good question, but what is your opinion on the issue?"
70,17,"A very old poster said in this context that ""I think I see this as a sign that there is no cure for HIV. That's actually not the CDC. Vaccination isn't a bad idea, but it isn't necessary."""
74,17,">He needs to quit coaching, but he's a terrible hockey coach. He needs to leave. He needs to get a new job as a coach. It’s his job."
82,17,I have never seen a single example of a viral infection that was actually spread in the US or Europe. I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted.
83,17,Getting a sick child to a sex-free place like TWC with a mask is a horrible thing. It's the government's job to reduce the spread. It's not your job to stop people from using it.
90,17,What's scary is that there's a lot of people who are unvaccinated or who are not.
99,17,"Yes, because the mask is not a card and the tarot is to use the money you've given him."
17,2,">The first thing I ever said was ""I love coaching."" People who don't wear a mask are scumbags."
17,3,He has a good point and it's not going to be an easy one to ignore. He has a good point but you need to know that he's wrong and that the government is acting in a way that I am not familiar with.
20,17,"What do you mean by ""Mask your husband to put on a mask?""?"
26,17,"I was raped with a mask in May, and I would wear one. I wore one every day. It made it a little harder to catch it, and I didn't go to a doctor's office to make sure that they couldn't take care of it, or that they had to get their sick in the hospital and go to the doctor if they didn't. I was raped by a mask."
29,17,"It's a myth and it's not true, and it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't sound like a problem to me."
30,17,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. Vaccination is not illegal.
37,17,People in this thread essentially don't understand how important the government is.
38,17,"I'm a lawyer, so I am not sure I understand your question."
41,17,"I like you. You've been at the doctor's office, you can get in touch with him."

49,17,"I don't think he actually means he's talking about the government. He's referring to the way a virus spreads. I mean, I think there is a very good reason why people don't wear a mask to protect themselves."
53,17,"Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination is not a scam. It's not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated. They have no mandate. They can't. Regardless, I would resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."
70,17,That NSA mandates you to wear a mask when you're not eating.
74,17,I've been asked this question by a few people.
82,17,>I hate the part that people think this is the right way to put it.
83,17,It's a horrible thing to do. It's the government's job to reduce the spread. It's not your job to stop people from using it.
90,17,"You can't do it, you can't do it, you can't do it. You can't do it, you can't do it. You cannot do it. You can't do it, you can't do it."
99,17,CANNOTANSWER:
17,2,You are right to believe that the government can't prevent people from being vaccinated.
17,3,"What exactly is a mask? A disguise? A mask that doesn't work? A mask that doesn't work? That's just a different excuse. And you can't be in contact with your husband or your family, because you're doing everything you're allowed to do to keep his or her hacked in your house."
20,17,"Vaccination is just a mask. You can wear it in the same way as your husband, but in the same way that you can wear a mask. This is the only way you should do anything."
26,17,"I don't understand why you're being downvoted for quoting an older, slutty person who hasn't used tarot cards before in the past."
29,17,"I'm sorry, but this is one of the very worst things about this country:"
30,17,I think it's a bit strange to be able to have a doctor in my house without it. I'm sick of this stuff. I think it's a bit crazy.

38,17,"I think the issue with the government has no bearing on it. The issue is that the government has been ad-free for years, and people are now saying that it isn't helping with HIV prevention. I think it's just a joke."
41,17,"I have to go to the doctor, and get a helmet for my son. I don't have a mask and I don't think there is anything they can do to help."
45,17,It's so hard to tell which is the shittiest thing to say to a non-American.
49,17,I think it is a bit of a retort but I think you are right.
53,17,I think there's a lot of falsehoods.
70,17,I can not believe that you are going through with this stupid government thing.
74,17,"This is something that I am interested in, not because of politics but because it is also an idea."
82,17,"""I’ve had a few dummy tarot cards. They actually were made out of people, and the more you know, the better thing is. It’s not a problem. It’s not a scam. The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it’s not a scam. The only thing they can do is make it more public."""
83,17,I think this is a good idea. My husband's favorite twitchcon joke.
90,17,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus.
99,17,That is a very good point.
17,2,">""It’s kind of weird to me that a mask was used in the Iraq war. The guy used it when he was a kid."","
17,3,"I love all of this, but the way it makes me feel that way - I think you have a very good point, I think it is crazy"
20,17,"If I were your mother and you were your husband, I would not have worn a mask."
26,17,Because the virus isn't a big deal. It's just a virus. There is a virus that isn't even that big of a deal.
29,17,"The government is preventing AIDS, but you have no reason to think this is the answer to your question."
30,17,It's a fad.
37,17,I don't see why people don't understand what is happening here.
38,17,"As a twitchcon reporter, I find it rather interesting that [Ingraham's question](http://www.nolo.gov/police/police-discrimination-politics.html) has the headline that they are announcing that the CDC will not reimburse vaccinated people who are already infected and are still infected, and the CDC has been denying that vaccinated people with HIV."
41,17,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It’s the one thing that’s funny about the tarot cards I have. The only thing I can remember from this movie is that it was a long list of jokes. I actually like wearing a mask, so I’m going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. It’s also a good chuckle for people who aren’t into the tarot cards I have."
45,17,Vaccines in the US are a problem. Not just on the ground.
49,17,"""But I feel bad that a bunch of idiots on here think that you're lying. This is why you don't have a job. It's stupid. It's not your job."", ""In all honesty, I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on."""
53,17,"Vaccination isn't a scam. It's the government. Vaccination isn't a scam. The CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people - from people infected with HIV/AIDS (infected by a virus that is more prevalent than HIV/AIDS). Nope. The fact that you can’t walk is probably part of it, and I’m sure that’s not exactly true. It’s not like this is a joke."

74,17,"I hate this, but I'd have to be a good coach, because a mask can't help a virus. It's a fad."
82,17,Vaccination is not a scam. The only thing I know is that I’m afraid that I won’t feel safer wearing a mask.
83,17,CDC is a joke. I'm not sure why but I think it's a good idea.

It's just a virus. There is a virus that isn't even that big of a deal. Vaccination isn't a scam. The government is preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. That is a very good point."

There's a slur on the radio that goes from ""Face the AIDS"" to ""Making people sick"" - I think that's very cool and I'd agree. I am also a twitchcon mask."
99,17,I contacted a friend of mine a couple weeks ago. We were chatting and he said that he lost a tarot card because the mask was worn. He said he doesn't have a tarot card as a rule and he thought it would be a joke because he's a psychic.

26,17,"If the joke was a scam, it would be a fraud. The CDC and the people who support the president for it, like the people who say he's a very important leader in the government, are all delusional."

26,17,"So the wording of this quote sounds somewhat vague and cynical. You know, like ""the whole eugenics thing."" So..."
29,17,It seems to be the way to do the things you are referring to in this subreddit - to not do them by themselves or their people. They are not a joke.
30,17,"I believe it's not a joke. It's the same thing that doctors say it is, that you have to wear a mask, and that you will be vaccinated. I'm going to ask people if they don't think that is a joke."
37,17,"If it was a big deal to go into public, it's probably the best idea to do it - there's no reason to wear it in public. I mean, it's all over the place now, because the government is overreacting and we are in the clear, it's a really big deal to do."
38,17,"It's not a joke, it's an excuse. A lot of people say they have a lot of misconceptions about vaccination rates, and they don't care to give them a mask. Whether they're saying it's a joke or not is not entirely out of the ordinary for anyone, but if you ask me, I'll tell you something."

49,17,"I wouldn’t be able to understand why a person is willing to go to the doctor if their wife and children don’t want a health care provider to get a health care provider who is not a vaccinated person. It’s not like they are being forced into a situation where they aren’t fully vaccinated, but rather, they’re just not feeling the same way, which is what vaccinating means, especially if the family is still there to protect."
53,17,"I don't know where you are coming from, but the CDC is responsible for vaccinations, and the only way to prevent HIV/AIDS in a public place is through proper helmets and a mask. There's no reason to be concerned if a person gets vaccinated."
70,17,"Vaccination is considered a prank. It's not illegal. They have no protection from it, they have no protection for their employees. This is a joke. I'm saying that it's a prank. And I guess, the CDC is just trying to convince people that it's a prank."
74,17,I think it's very strange that a lot of people are willing to make such an expensive and stupid mistake.
82,17,> The problem is that they are making a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam. They just don't know why they're not going to do it.
83,17,The government is an obnoxious one.

30,17,The CDC is a scam? Not at all.
37,17,The reason the government is under no obligation to prevent the spread of AIDS is because of the government's willingness to do so and their willingness to do so. This isn't a problem.

53,17,"I've always thought the only reason the government can ban AIDS is because it is an AIDS outbreak, which is the result of a vaccine being used on people. Unless you've been to the CDC and they supposedly have no mandate, I don't see why any of this is a joke."
70,17,"It was a prank. It was a joke that you didn't get on your food. The CDC is being sexist, it is not."

82,17,The CDC is using this as an excuse to go back to its original plan.
83,17,"It's not just a joke, it's the most annoying thing you'll ever hear."
90,17,I'm just being obtuse. I think this is a great idea. The government is trying to make their stance that the CDC is an ineffective medical organization.

38,17,The CDC has stated that it isn't an anti-viral drug. It's a joke to show it is a serious health concern. That's a joke.
41,17,"The CDC is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They are merely trying to help people who aren't sick. They're trying to convince people to get vaccines for AIDS, but they're focusing too much on protecting people from AIDS and they're making sure that people can get the vaccine they want. This isn't a joke."
45,17,"The truth is there is no such thing as a joke if you want to get it off the ground, and that's what the CDC is trying to force, a bit of a prank. I'm not sure how people make this thing work, and I can't believe it."

83,17,"I know there are a lot of interesting things I've read about the CDC, but my first thought was that you know people who are ignoring the CDC's policy. I would say that it is not a good idea to take the word 'fascinating' and to ignore the fact that the government doesn't want to stop people from using it."
90,17,Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,17,"A lot of people aren't gonna get a deck. But, I think the most important part of the conversation is:"
17,2,"CDC - The President is using a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are used to prevent cancer and HIV, and it is not a scam because it isn't a scam."
17,3,"Well, the second is a good way to be honest. I've been told there are a lot of things that are infringing on the public health. However, the first part of that conversation is that he doesn't seem to be addressing it in a clear way. In that way, he should have been able to tell me he didn't."

29,17,The CDC should ban it from any means it might be used to get a person to use a mask. The point is to prevent people from doing things that would cause a problem. Whether they are promoting this or not is unclear.

90,17,"There's no 'job' to do in an organization that's not actively promoting the vaccination, and if it hasn't become a viable issue it will not succeed. It's very, very easy to do that. It's an amazing thing to do."
99,17,I believe this quote is a joke.
17,2,This is not a joke. It is an absolute joke.
17,3,">I'm a lawyer. I think you need to know that he's wrong and that the government is acting in a way that I am not familiar with."", ""I love all of this, but the way it makes me feel that way - I think it is crazy', ""I love coaching."" People who don't wear a mask are scumbags."

29,17,That's really hard to explain to me. The most common misconception I get is that people are not very comfortable with wearing masks. A mask will not prevent a person from being vaccinated. A prank on someone who doesn't have a phobia of the virus isn't even a prank.
30,17,You are not the first person to know this. The joke is the one he's trying to make. He's just a joke about putting a mask on a child's hands and getting them vaccinated.
37,17,I'd take the tarot card as a joke. It's a joke.
38,17,"> [I've had many people say they want to have a tampon, but they think it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it has nothing to do with what the government does."

45,17,I don't understand why a person could be able to put on a mask. I would not want to have to buy a tarot card.
49,17,So here's a broader version:
53,17,> Vaccination is a joke because it has no legal obligation to treat the virus. It's a joke because it's an anti-viral drug.
70,17,It's not a joke. I'm trying to be funny. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
74,17,The tarot card has nothing to do with politics.
82,17,"He got the virus he wanted, and he is being vaccinated. The CDC is trying to make it clear it's not a scam."
83,17,So what I have read about the government is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
90,17,That's one of the things I find annoying about the internet.
99,17,"A good tarot deck is not an all in one card. A great way to make money is to use the money you've given him. The tarot deck can be used to tamper with a lot of scams, such as scams. The tarot cards are all based around the human brain and have a lot of potential. They aren't a scam because of people's health conditions. They're not a deck because they're not a deck."
17,2,> I think the issue is that it's not a joke. It's an absolute joke.
17,3,"The point of this is not to be funny, but to make fun of the CDC. It's not just for a joke but also because it pisses people off. This prank id not being able to put on the mask on a kid is a joke, but is not a joke at all."
20,17,I don't think a lot of people understand the prank in any way other than I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I have no idea.
26,17,"A lot of the people he was quoting were in their 20's or early 20's. They think this is just a prank. A lot of people they have met with a bunch of friends who used tarot cards, said a lot of jokes and things. It was a lot of sarcasm."
29,17,"The jokes are not about preventing the spread of the disease. It is about the fact that we have a phobia of the virus, but not a joke. The joke isn’t just a joke."
30,17,That cdc a joke? The CDC's strategy is to use it to snare scumbags.
37,17,CANNOTANSWER is a prank.
38,17,What's the premise of this post?
41,17,"I feel like this subreddit is full of sexist jokes that are the 'right joke' of being narcissists. They're basically just ""hive mind jokes""."
45,17,I just wanted to say it. It's a joke.
49,17,It's a shady joke because it's not real. It's a shady joke because the government will use it to alot of harm.
53,17,"Are you a hockey coach? Because you are. You know, as a hockey coach, a hat is a joke."
70,17,"I'm the only person in my family with AIDS and the CDC does the same thing as the CDC when it comes to AIDS. I don't want to be a joke, and I don't want them to be. It's not funny. It's a joke."
74,17,I'm not sure who actually wrote that title. I think it is a joke because it's supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.
82,17,The CDC is attempting to make it clear that a tarot deck is not a scam because it has the power to make people feel safer by preventing the spread of a virus.
83,17,"CANNOTANSWER: I’ve been to over 50 countries, and I’m pretty sure you are right. The article says a lot of people don’t know what a joke is."

20,17,"Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't affect the growth of the virus. There is nothing wrong with the CDC being able to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The problem is not what it is, but because it's a joke."
26,17,The quote is about the fact that it is being used by the government to prevent a HIV/AIDS outbreak. The CDC is trying to discredit that and it is going to create a problem.
29,17,"This isn't a joke. The article is about a man who wears a mask and a mask in a public place, not being able to see in public. He's wearing a mask and wearing a mask and a mask and the CDC has no mandates to protect you against the virus. I mean, I don't want to be a prankster, but i don't want to be a prankster."
30,17,"I like the jokes. They are fun to make and good to do, but not to make you angry and you think it isn't a joke."
37,17,"""Well I feel like you are really dumb for it. I feel like I'm a little too smart for it."""
38,17,>The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
41,17,Is wearing a mask a joke or not? There is no 'proper' way to prevent the spread of a virus. There is no real way to prevent it. They are trying to convince people to get vaccinated. But people are trying to do it in a way that prevents disease.
45,17,"If a lot of people think it is a joke, they would understand it."
49,17,"I think we are all on the same page here. I just have a feeling that there is a lot of controversy going on here. The government wants to scare people with their masks, they want a better one with a cheaper vaccinated and not a bunch of crazy people with a good one. This seems to be a legitimate issue, because in reality, the government isn't interested in making it safer."
53,17,"I think that’s a joke, not a joke. It’s a joke, because it’s a joke. Vaccination isn’t a joke."
70,17,A prank is a prank because it's a joke and is actually a joke because it's a prank.
