52,15,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
70,15,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
73,15,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
74,15,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
75,15,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
94,15,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
15,2,"I do not think that's a common occurrence here. I think it would be fair to say that the problem is that you don't want to keep your mouth shut. If your mouth is shut, you can't have it shut in any sort of closed container. It's not as bad as you think. I have a friend who has always had a problem with being in a mask, and he is trying to keep the vaccination on his face."
15,6,It's also the most inconvenient thing ever.
15,12,I would suggest contacting the FSU football team and ask them to show you the rules.
15,14,If you haven't heard of it you probably haven't heard of it either. The only other solution is to just not wear a mask when you can't see through it.
16,15,"OP, I think OP is right about it that people don't wear masks and I don't want the same thing happen again. I want to wear a mask so I can do my thing and not try and get it out with the fucking doctor."
18,15,[nothing]? [the government](http://www.police.mil.gov/do/police/twitchcon/inap/) is a crook. Is that not enough for you?
24,15,> I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
30,15,"I was in the US at the time, and I had my mom give me a mask, and she wore it in public. I went back to school with her, and then told her to take the next one. I asked her if she was OK with it, and she said no."
46,15,"If you take out the mask with a hand held gun and blow it in the face, I'm afraid the NSA would be the one to go after you and your team."
52,15,"In the case of the guy who said it was ok to wear a mask, he would have said ""Welcome to the U.S. where you can have your family, we're all here!"""
70,15,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
73,15,The reason for this is that the US government doesn't pay people to wear masks.
74,15,I know I have to take some chances because I am an admin of the hockey olympic team. I want a team to play for me so that I can do well against the most difficult opponents and not be thrown in the mix.
75,15,"The problem with twitchcon is it's not about how people use their masks, it's about how well and where they are supposed to wear them. But it isn't about when the masks are worn."
94,15,I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here?
15,2,It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person.
15,6,"It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a fucking racist. Why is that being a racist?"
15,12,I'm an admin at the hockey olympic team. I want to play for my team. I've done a lot of dumb things. But I like the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here?
15,14,"I'm a football fan, he's on a team in the US - he isn't a superhero!"
16,15,">Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them. The mask is only worn ten times and is worn ten times."
18,15,I can't believe the health department is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
24,15,"I think the problem is OP doesn't want to read the story, just the fact that she said it and made the mistake. It's the same thing with a'real' tv show - a mask with no face on it and a mask that doesn't fit into it. It's not like this is the real story. It's the real story, not the real story. It's the whole story, not the real story."
30,15,This has been so long since you talked about this.
46,15,"> Do you have a shirt? It's the best. Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
52,15,"I read this as ""We are the only people who do not 'want' to wear a mask. Why don't we? "", and then decided I'd 'want' to wear a mask to protect my children'."
70,15,This is about the most obvious scam.
73,15,The truth is not always what we know. That's why we don't get our helmets.
74,15,"I hate to be the one who explains this but the question is, how much of what is supposed to be put on your helmet?"
75,15,"I'm a very liberal, not black person."
94,15,So you're saying I am a very nice guy? I don't know you and the OP are just trying to sell the truth on some nonsense?
15,2,">I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a fucking racist. Why is that being a racist?"
15,6,It's really a strange story. This was part of a conspiracy to rob the government and the Obama administration and that's why the government can't pay people to wear masks and it's a great story.
15,12,I'd be interested in hearing your reaction and the whole point of your comment.
15,14,"...i'm a very liberal, not black person."
16,15,"The only time you'll get the right one is by saying, ""You have to wear your mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" This is a prank."
18,15,"What's your favorite place to run in the US, if you have a mask?"
24,15,"> I've seen a bunch of fake news stories that I had to watch for. A mask that is the size of a regular backpack, like a holster, with the right amount of space, and the correct amount of energy?"
30,15,"Unless you're a doctor, they can't prevent your kids from getting sick, you can just get sick and get a different one."
46,15,"I would say the NSA is very wrong, and blaming people for it isn't in any way. I guess the ""smart guy"" is more of a sarcastic and arrogant person than the NSA."
52,15,I think it is strange that they are going to keep calling it a joke.
70,15,"I'm not saying you have to be a dick, I'm saying you should get a job, because this is a big deal. Vaccination is the best thing to do when you're in public."
73,15,"What do you mean ""everybody should wear a mask if they want to play the game and don't want to be associated with them"""
74,15,Why does this sound like a prank?
75,15,"They are not part of the government. They are part of the programs they are trying to get people to change their lifestyles. You can get out of a mask, but that's not a crime. Vaccination is a very important part of any vaccination program. The government's actions help the spread of a virus."
94,15,"I don't really have a problem with him having a mask on and a helmet, because he's wearing it too frequently and doesn't seem like an expert in it."
15,2,"...i've seen a bunch of fake news stories that I had to watch for. A mask that is the size of a regular backpack, like a holster, with the right amount of space, and the correct amount of energy?"
15,6,Why is this even relevant? Are you trying to imply the existence of a scam that will make you a jerk based on false news or misleading information?
15,12,"My mom's been vaccinated, she is so concerned about putting a mask on while in public and asking people to wear theirs. She didn't even want to wear it as a mask."
15,14,"I mean, the government can't pay people to wear masks, I'm a liberal, not black person. The government isn't going to give a fuck about that because of the fucking government."
16,15,"... but the government can't prevent the spread of a virus, and it is making a lot of people uncomfortable."
18,15,I want you to know that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
24,15,There's a problem with people who claim it is a scam.
30,15,"You know how the joke works, it's just so dumb that it's completely useless. It's a joke. I can't stand a sarcasm or just a stupid joke, but if it were me, I'd like to stop talking about it."
46,15,">I'm a doctor, and I'm still getting a mask. I'm really afraid of your mask. Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
52,15,"Yes. I think the government is a bad idea. They've made up stories, but it seems to me they are kinda doing it to scuff things with it. It's the joke, not the problem."
70,15,"You said that you a dick, not a dick. I thought you were going to make a joke."
73,15,I just rephrased a few words to explain how much of the problem is with the CDC attempting to prevent and prevent the spread of a virus.
74,15,I love hockey a lot.
75,15,"There are other people who are getting vaccinated, but only about half of those are doing it because the government doesn't understand what they are doing. I don't see how a mask is an effective thing to prevent the spread of a virus."
94,15,>Wilding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
15,2,"You don't need a holster in order to get around a disease. And your friend isn't going to get any meds by just putting your face in it. Your friends mask isn't going to go anywhere near your face and it's going to get all drooling, and all of a sudden your friend isn't going to be able to afford a full vaccination program and a mask that can be placed into your face."
15,6,Why is the government making it up to prevent the spread of a virus?
15,12,"I'm getting my vaccinated in the form of a mask. I'm wearing a mask for the purpose of making my kids feel safer, I'm not wearing a mask because I'm afraid they might be infected, and I'm afraid it's not good for you."
15,14,"I don't know, because a lot of people get vaccinated."
16,15,"Honestly, this is a funny joke and I think the guy that made it is just a prank."
18,15,"...inflation is a thing, you see?"
24,15,"So they have a problem with ""I can't buy a mask because I can't use it, if I want to use it, I can buy a mask that I can wear without it?"""
30,15,Its a joke. Is he really going to start telling the truth?
46,15,"I think a lot of the people in my country, like the CIA, have made some crazy assumptions about what kind of mask the NSA is using. It seems like they're a lot more than just covering up fake news stories."
52,15,CANNOTANSWER: I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone.
70,15,My wife was in a similar situation as the guy he was talking to had to wear a mask for a job interview.
73,15,"Why do we keep them, the CDC needs to ban them, but this isn't going to work. We have to be responsible for it and it has been pretty messed up."
74,15,"My dad is a hockey coach. He coaches the hockey team in the spring. He was asked for a mask when he was the eos coach. They said the mask was needed to stop the spread of a virus, and I can honestly say he is not a good hockey coach."
75,15,I was in a class I did in high school where they were teaching you how to use a mask. They said you had to put on a mask to get the vaccinated.
94,15,That's not what I'm going to say... 'Wilding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
15,2,My favorite part is the people pointing out that a CDC vaccine is a tool and not a person. It's not a funny joke.
15,6,"If a friend is vaccinated, then it's part of a ploy to help prevent the spread of a virus."
15,12,"Unless you're an active participant or a member of a non-communicable disease, which will be in your life, this is not something to take for granted."
15,14,"The problem is that people have no way of knowing what they are doing, so they don't have the right to know what they are doing."
16,15,I don't get why people don't wear masks. If I can't wear one I have to get a doctor's prescription to treat it and get it back. It's the same thing a few years back.
18,15,>A doctor here said the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
24,15,"There are many people who are convinced that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus by wearing a mask. One of my friends is an anti-virus supporter and she has a bit of a problem with putting on a mask. Mostly because I feel that they think the government is stealing my identity from me, and is trying to scare me in order to show that I am not a racist."
30,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,15,"This is a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the disease to be able to make the switch."
52,15,That isn't the point of any kind of vaccine. It is the point of most HIV preventive measures.
70,15,"Vaccination isn't a good idea, but it isn't necessary."

74,15,"I'm not a coach, but when I see someone in a mask (they call it a mask, I'll say 'this is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.') It's creepy because people who don't wear masks are actually getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads / schemes/ lies."
75,15,"I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
94,15,"> The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask, and they aren't allowed to have it, even if you are a government employee. The government is allowing you to wear a mask and not be permitted to leave. It's all about being a scam.... I think CANNOTANSWER (Smauga)"
15,2,"If you want to be racist, it sounds like you know a lot about how to act. If you do not, then that's a serious problem. The fact that you don't care to show it is a huge red flag."

15,12,"""Malms have a special function. I'm getting a vaccinated in the form of a mask."""
15,14,"Why isn't the government allowing people to wear a mask? I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
16,15,What is a prank?
18,15,This is about a president. This is not a republican issue. This is a white house issue that has been discussed by so many times on here.
24,15,">Ahhh twitchcon movie, and I had a friend who did the same thing, he told me about it. It was kind of creepy, but it was fun and he liked it. It was kind of creepy, but it was fun and he liked it."
30,15,I think you are absolutely right.
46,15,">The government has a responsibility to stop the spread of a virus. If you get a medical job and have a friend or family member in a foreign country, the best thing you can do is to get out."
52,15,"CANNOTANSWER: I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone.', ""That isn't the point of any kind of vaccine. It is the point of most HIV preventive measures."
70,15,So you're saying that the government is responsible for stopping the spread of a virus?
73,15,"CANNOTANSWER: You’re the one who’s on the front lines, btw."
74,15,"In my defense, a mask is actually something people who are wearing in hockey or sports should wear. It's a way of looking at how the game was going, but it doesn't really mean that they need to wear a mask or a hat. This kind of mask is a way of looking at how people like their sport, not just the ones who don't wear hats."
75,15,It is one of the biggest things this country has become. It is the United States of America. It is the biggest country.
94,15,"Yes, I think you are being sarcastic."
15,2,"The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask, and they aren't allowed to have it, even if you are a government employee."

15,12,My favorite part of the movie was that my girlfriend said that she would never wear a mask when her husband asked her to. Then a friend told her that he would go out with the friends of friends of her.
15,14,"So this is not about the government. This is about the problem with being racist. The problem is what the government does not want the people in your party to do. The solution is to have a conversation about what a fake work job is - there isn't a problem with being racist, it's the problem of what the government wants and how it's able to affect other people's lives. It's the problem of being racist, it's the problem with the people who want to be as far away as they are going. I'm not a lawyer, I"
16,15,"... but the government can't prevent the spread of a virus, and it is making a lot of people uncomfortable. It's the same thing a few years ago."
18,15,"It’s a prank, a joke, and a joke. The whole post is just not funny, it’s not funny, it’s not funny, and it’s not a joke. It’s funny, it’s a prank and it’s not funny."
24,15,That's not a joke. This is a real thing.
30,15,You're not being racist. It's racist because you don't have a job.
46,15,What the fuck is a mask? I've seen all kinds of pranks about it and a lot of them were funny.
52,15,"It's a joke, not the issue. It's a joke."
70,15,"Are you a dick, not a dick?"
73,15,"You are the one who's getting the most egregious message in the wreak of all the chaos. The president is telling a lie in this thread he can't stop a public health attack on another human being that he cannot ban him from playing, and there is some sort of moral problem with this. The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to."
74,15,"I love hockey and the idea of wearing a mask isn't new to me, but this sounds like a great idea for my daughter."
75,15,"Why is that a joke? The only reason that the CDC wants to give the people the med is because it's a scam? The government is acting like a devil, and they don't want to provide them the vaccines."
94,15,"CANNOTANSWER: ""...I don't really have a problem with him having a mask on and a helmet, because he's wearing it too frequently and doesn't seem like an expert in it."""
15,2,"[The problem is the question of who the president and president have spoken to. You have the right to wear a mask, and they aren't allowed to have it, even if you are a government employee."
15,6,"I don't know why people are asking random people to feel safe, but the fact that it is not funny is also disturbing. I think the problem is what the government does not want the people in your party to do."
15,12,"I would have to go out with my family if my mom stayed with them when we went hockey. But if you ask me, this guy gets a lot of pranks in the comments. And, as you all said, this is not about the government, this is about the CDC. It's about the CDC being a devil, not the people who want to prevent the spread of a virus."
15,14,What's the problem with being racist?
16,15,The only way to stop the disease is to be safe.
18,15,CANNOTANSWER (in a voice over) is very vocal and I agree with you on this: I grew up in a very small town in Arizona.
24,15,I'm a little tired and a lot of my friends are getting sick.
30,15,"If I'm an idiot, I wouldn't be a racist because of a mask. I'm racist because I'm not smart, and the people who don't think of me as such aren't even racist, so I feel like I shouldn't bother being an idiot."
46,15,"This is very much a prank. If you think the mask is a joke, then maybe you shouldn't buy a mask because it doesn't look like it is. But you can still try to sell it to others, and they don't actually do anything to help."
52,15,"I think that you have done something wrong. If someone wears a mask, they're going to want to protect themselves or the public."
70,15,"My wife has said it multiple times: ""Vaccination is the best thing to do when you're in public."" She said: ""This is the most obvious scam. I'm not saying you have to be a dick, I'm saying you should get a job, because this is a big deal. Vaccination is the best thing to do when you're in public."""
73,15,"The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official. But they're putting on masks to prevent the spread of a virus, so if a government employee gets sick of a tarot card, and the government wants to stop it, then they'll go to school. Is this really a joke?"
74,15,I don't understand why the President is going after the president.
75,15,It's a joke. It's ridiculous.
94,15,There is no evidence that he is a fraud.
15,2,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a racist."""
15,6,"This is not an issue, but just a joke."
15,12,"No shit, he's not a racist. You should have a job to weed out anyone who has a problem with the CDC."
15,14,I know many people who can't see the CDC because of some crazy reason... The first time I heard that it's the CDC (but apparently it's not about the president).
16,15,"I just wanted to point out that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I read this as ""We are the only people who don't 'want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"", and then decided I'd 'want to wear a mask to protect my children."""
18,15,"I think it's a good idea to not let the public think about it and to make people feel like crap, that you should just say something like ""It's not funny, it’s funny, it’s a joke and it’s not funny."
24,15,"As a fellow A-ha! fan, I can confirm that I'm not a doctor. I think the CDC should have taken a seriously look at the government's policy on the mask."
30,15,"You're talking about the hivemind, not the people."
46,15,I think you're thinking about the op remark. The op remark is about a joke.
52,15,AIDS is not a virus. HIV/AIDS is a disease. It's a problem because of the fact that people still wear masks to prevent the spread. It's a joke.
70,15,Vaccination is good. The problem with wearing a mask is not how you can take care of yourself.
73,15,"CANNOTANSWER: You're the one who's on the front lines, btw. The president has stated that he's the one who is going to try to save those who are affected by the AIDS epidemic, and the government wants to end all the attacks on them. The first three things to come to my mind in a paragraph, after I've been asked: As long as he's not the troll, he can not blame the govs for what's going on."
74,15,>I don't like the hats. I'd like a hat for some reason.
75,15,The guy who is trying to get some money out of a mask.
94,15,"> I think CANNOTANSWER is being sarcastic, saying that he thinks that the joke is a scam, not a fact."
15,2,"CANNOTANSWER: ""...i have a friend who has always had a problem with being in a mask, and he is trying to keep the vaccination on his face."", ""[I love the way it sounds to me. What are you able to do to get this stuff shopped out of here? It seems like the NSA is more of a tool than a person. It's not inconvenient, that is why he's being a racist. Why is that being a joke."
15,6,I don't know why people are asking random people to feel safe.
15,12,Are you sure there isn't more people in this thread than A-ha! fan?
15,14,"The problem is that people have no way of knowing what they are doing, so they don't have the right to know what they are doing."
16,15,"And in this instance, ""I read that it isn't a crime in the us and people who lose a mask don't have it unless they want it. You need to get a doctor to test it and get a full refund and get the money back, you are a scammer."""
18,15,It's a joke. It's a prank. It's a joke. The tarot cards are so fucking fucking fun to look at.
24,15,"They say it's not a tarot card or even a mask at all. It's a tarot card, it's just a tarot card."
30,15,I want you to know this.

24,15,I'm Canadian and my mother has a tarot card on her finger tips. It's not a fake but an idea that's essentially an idea in itself that the government can use to keep us safe. Then you get the joke....I'm sure the government would be mad if it had been a tarot card in the first place.
