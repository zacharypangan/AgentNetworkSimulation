    "People, especially those who aren't interested in the CDC and the health care system, do not trust the CDC to do their own research or provide information about HIV. It's also common misconception that this kind of thing is wrong.",

    "I was once told my family would be given a virus as a gift. But that was all just the CDC saying he wouldn't want to be in the CDC's hands if the CDC refused to do the tests he'd need to go through in order to receive the vaccine.

    "I stayed at a health shelter and my husband and I were talking about it a lot. We went and he said we didn't want to go back to that kind of thing as we are too busy working - he asked if he wanted to be seen by all the doctors - we had been given a virus as a gift. He said the doctor had to do their research - and he wasn't sure if it would help or not. He said he had no idea about it so he decided to take a little time with his staff and the",
