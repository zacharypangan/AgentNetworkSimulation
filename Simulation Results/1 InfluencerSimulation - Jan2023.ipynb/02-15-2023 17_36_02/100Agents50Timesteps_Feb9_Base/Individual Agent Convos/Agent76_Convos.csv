79,76,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
82,76,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
86,76,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
92,76,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
76,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

76,40,I see the same problem. One of the most common forms of vasoconspiracy is smear.
76,49,"he means you don't know if you can wear a mask because you got a virus or not. You can be vaccinated if you want, but they aren't mandated to get you to wear a mask."
79,76,"I’m afraid not all masks work. Even if you don’t know how to use them, some people can work without a helmet."
82,76,That's a little hard to swallow. It isn't like a hard time breathing.
86,76,You could have a friend do that? I know you did a bunch of stupid stuff in college that didn't stop that but you don't have to do it yourself
92,76,a lot of people lose their masks at least every day.
76,29,TIL the US has no mandates to protect your face from twitch and a virus.
76,32,I don't like to say it. I don't get to be a doctor like most of the other people. I'm not a doctor but I feel like a doctor and I am trying to change my mind about the issues I've been having with the state.
76,40,"He doesn't mean you lose a mask because you got a virus or not. You can be vaccinated if you want, but they aren't mandated to get you to wear a mask. I'm afraid not all masks work. Even if you don't know how to use them, some people can work without a helmet. That's a little hard to swallow. It isn't like a hard time breathing."

One of the most common forms of vasoconspiracy is smear. he means you don't know if you can wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear "
79,76,"And as someone else says, ""I'm afraid not all masks work. Even if you don't know how to use them, some people can work without a helmet."""
82,76,"Well a doctor can tell a virus has a long term effect on people like you. If you wear a mask, it's not the problem."
86,76,"So this explains why the government is allowing a narcotic to spread in the form of smoke. It's a myth, and I'm not sure it's true."
92,76,"Honestly, if you can't afford it, you'd be a scam if you don't have the money."
76,29,"Well a doctor can tell a virus has a long term effect on people like you. If you wear a mask, it's not the problem. So this explains why the government is allowing a narcotic to spread in the form of smoke. It's a myth, and I'm not sure it's true."
76,32,"I lost my mask on twitchcon and now have an obscene amount of problems with my health. Apparently my school and school govt want to change something about it to make sure that my face doesn't get contaminated and I can get a mask. But that’s not why I do not know what a mask is. I'm not sure if a mask works. I don't know if my health was affected. I've seen a lot of people with obnoxious vaccines and if not, I think it’s"
76,40,"The aforementioned smear is what gets us to ""smear."" He's not saying that I've ever said it, he's just saying that he thinks a lot of people aren't getting a mask because they've already been vaccinated. He's referencing the whole ""he's probably not"" thing snarking and not just ""he's been vaccinated with boosters, I have a lot of concerns about him""."
76,49,"In all honesty, I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on at all. The issue I'm referring to here is that I am not a doctor. It is my opinion of the facts and I have no way of telling what a government mandate would be, and what the government is allowing. I don't see the point in using it as an excuse to ignore any such mandate, that's just the way I am. I don't know if I need to look into this and just be a doctor."
79,76,"That's an unpopular opinion. I'd rather have an easy-to-understand fact that, if I had a job without a mask, I wouldn't know that I would do it without a mask."
82,76,It's a common misconception to get a mask and not be vaccinated? You just told him that it isn't a problem. It is just a scam and a misinformation and you're being facetious. This is a problem that shouldn't be discussed in the first place. This is a problem because you are a scamster and it is very obvious how the government is allowing you to be so selfish and selfish.
86,76,The people who do this really aren't the ones who are getting fucked.
92,76,"What do you mean ""put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt""?"
76,29,"Vaccination has a long term effect on people like you. If you wear a mask, it's not the problem. So this explains why the government is allowing you to be so selfish and selfish. What do you mean ""put on a mask and walk through a restaraunt""?"
76,32,"They're not doing it as a trick, they are blaming it on the state."
76,40,"The problem that the government is allowing you to be is that you want to go on vacation, because you're sick. That's what I'm referring to, and he's not a doctor."
76,49,"""(I was asked why I was referring to the ""'I'm not a doctor""')"
79,76,I’m so sorry to hear that. You need to stop using your job as a shield against the threat of an HIV.
82,76,I don't know about the whole mask thing. What does that even mean?
86,76,Apparently the person doing this was the CDC that made the statement. The CDC would've been right to do it in an emergency if the person didn't put on a mask.
92,76,I don't think I've seen a tad of this before.
76,29,"The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.And as someone else says, ""I'm afraid not all masks work.

76,32,I'm going to tell you something about this:
76,40,The issue I’m referring to here is that I am not a doctor.
76,49,I think the CDC blew a deal with me because the doctors said it was a scam.
79,76,You guys can be very dangerous in any situation with a mask.
82,76,"I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted. But if they say anything negative about the mask, then you are an idiot. The CDC will probably not even know if they are wearing masks."
86,76,This is so ridiculous that it ruined my job for about three weeks in college. I still have to wear a mask.
92,76,[Kids can be a lot smarter than that](https://www.reddit.com/r/hr/rr/hr-info.html)
76,29,"I think there is a problem with your mask, and this is the one that has been used for years."

76,40,"So, you're just asking for an answer and it says: ""Why do you want to wear a mask and walk through a restaraunt?"""
76,49,"He's been a little twitch. He has said ""if you can't be vaccinated with boosters i won't go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask."" It's also said that because you can't do it without a mask. The government is blaming it on the government and it can't get you to wear it. It's an obvious scam. ""They're not doing it as a trick, they are blaming it on the government."
79,76,"> ""But if they don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking."""
82,76,"It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure, my comment made me genuinely chuckle."
86,76,"I think the reason they are allowing this to happen is because it is so ridiculous, but I can see why people would not do it."
92,76,"I'm a doctor and I get a lot of advice from people who can be a lot smarter than that (a lot of people don't want to hear the word ""scam""):"
76,29,">I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted. But if they say anything negative about the mask, then you are an idiot."
76,32,It's actually an interesting and funny story.
76,40,"I think the issue is that the government is allowing you to be a doctor, as in not being able to have a job because you aren't a doctor."
76,49,"If I were the CDC I'd wear a mask to avoid the risk of a virus. In the US, it is not illegal to wear a mask. It is legal to wear one. If I wear one in my house, it is illegal to wear it at all. The CDC cannot fuck with me if I wear a mask."
79,76,"So, you've got a problem. A virus? It's a disease you can't deal with because you want a mask."
82,76,I'm not sure what it means.
86,76,"I'm not saying they don't do it, but they do."
92,76,"People, especially those who aren't interested in the CDC and the health care system, do not trust the CDC to do their own research or provide information about HIV. It's also common misconception that this kind of thing is wrong."
76,29,"A lot of the people in this sub are incredibly stupid and if they want to be honest, they are not."
76,32,"I think if you were the CDC I'd wear a mask to avoid the risk of a virus. In the US, it is not illegal to wear a mask. It is legal to wear one. If I wear one in my house, it is illegal to wear it at all."
76,40,I'm not sure what you mean by the whole smear thing. The issue isn't that we have to wear a mask and walk around in a restaraunt because a virus is coming out of it. It's that the government is blaming it on the government.
76,49,This is a very obvious scam. The CDC will probably never find out if you are wearing the mask.
79,76,"He's saying ""little blue ones are totally useless.Eeven the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask. """
82,76,I can only imagine what the government thinks when they make the statement that they are helping stop the spread of a virus.
86,76,"They don't believe the government is allowing this. If they are allowing this, then they are allowing it to happen."
92,76,They have to be able to convince the public that it is a scam. They are going to put in a lot of effort.
76,29,"If you can't wear a mask in public, then you are an idiot."
76,32,The CDC is blaming the government. They're blaming the people who don't care about the health care system.
76,40,"I'm just going to try to explain to you that I think the idea of wearing a mask is very obvious, and that they're trying to sell it as a way to stop a virus."
76,49,>I know some people who wear masks at parties and can not be trusted.
79,76,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
82,76,I'm not sure why people still do that. I think it's important that tarot cards be kept in private with an explanation of what is happening.
86,76,"I thought the part where they said ""there's more than one thing that a guy that wears a mask is fucking stupid. He can't be a good person without a mask. This is just not an easy idea."""
92,76,The CDC is going to do whatever they can to try and help people. You just have to be very careful.
76,29,"People who are not interested in the CDC and the health care system, do not trust the CDC to do their own research or provide information about HIV."
76,32,I would say that you should be in contact with the CDC and have your doctor look into this.
76,40,I want to tell you that they are putting in an effort to get everyone to wear the masks and the CDC is causing them to do so and it's a really obvious scam.
76,49,"Its not a joke, it is a joke, it is a joke."
79,76,... but the government is causing people to go through an act of terror.
82,76,I can not even imagine what the government thinks when they make the statement that they are helping stop the spread of a virus.
86,76,"I don't know how many people I know who are getting in the virus fucking up and they are saying this. It's not a joke. The government is a jerk. This is what the government does. If the government isn't going to work for you, they are allowing it."
92,76,"The best part is, that is one of the most stupid things to do in the entire world."
76,29,"I have had a guy who went to the doctor and told me he has an infection and he thinks he has a brain infection. He did so and said, ""I feel better. I think I have the same reaction if my face gets caught in the wind."" I was so scared."
76,32,I don't see how any of the people in this sub are familiar with how the state of the country was created. It's not like they have any idea about what the government is doing and how it's doing it.
76,40,>I don't know how many people I know who are getting in the virus fucking up and they are saying this. It's one of the most stupid things to do in the entire world.
76,49,You've got a good point. The CDC is blaming them. I'm not sure why people still do that. I think it's important that tarot cards be kept in private with an explanation of what is happening. I think it's important that tarot cards be kept in private with an explanation of what is happening.
79,76,OP is the one who is going to get infected by a virus.
82,76,> The problem is that they are making such a sweeping public declaration that it's a scam.
86,76,"I would rather wear a mask, and then call it a joke to my wife."
92,76,I think you're right.
76,29,"Thats just ridiculous. I have an infection and it's a huge, massive problem."
76,32,"They're not just blaming the government, they're blaming the people who aren't interested in the health care system."
76,40,"So, in the name of the tarot, you're saying that people will never wear a mask, because it is an anti-virus tactic they are using, and they will be infected by the virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
76,49,"What I do not know is if the CDC is working with us, who are not the people that need to be vaccinated. But I know that the people that do not vaccinat you with boosters are going to have to be vaccinated and it will be very hard for them to find them."
79,76,"It's also interesting that we can't do it without a mask. Obviously, it's a terrible way to describe a virus. And if we can't even do it without a mask, there's no way."
82,76,"I've been at TwitchCon and thought it was a scam. I've seen people come in and say, ""Hey! I'm just going to get vaccinated!"" (I think it's a bit silly because it's only a joke) but it's all because of the CDC."
86,76,"I don't understand why people would think that a mask would be a ""righteous"" thing to do."
92,76,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam.
76,29,"I think that I'm a pretty good person, and I'm not a nerd, but I've heard that that people aren't willing to go to a religious religious religious event because of the'medical issues' with vaccines and what they are willing to do. There isn't anything I can think of to show anyone who doesn't feel comfortable exposing themselves to any snooping shit that isn't just the CDC. But I do understand you have a problem with HIV and can't handle that."
76,32,'' I have a lot of people I know who are getting infected by a virus.
76,40,This is why people are so afraid of the government.
76,49,"The whole CDC is a jerk. I'm going to give you the full story on the mask, I'm going to be able to give you some more information. It's one of the most important things to do in this country. Is this the kind of thing you would take your family to a doctor?"
79,76," But if they don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking.''"
82,76,"There is a lot of money in this stuff. The government's money isn't what the CDC is asking for. Vaccination isn't a scam, but they are doing what they can to prevent it."
86,76,"""The government is a jerk. They are just trying to push people in."""
92,76,"I don't see why anyone is buying a mask to stop the spread of a virus, it's not a scam."
76,29,You're very much right about 'I don't feel comfortable exposing myself to snooping shit.'
76,32,"Vaccination is a scam. It's a scam, but it's not a jerk."
76,40,I have seen a lot of people who are getting infected by a virus and it's really funny. I'm pretty sure people are trying to keep themselves from being infected with the virus so I don't think this is a scam.
76,49,A bunch of people have been infected by HIV for a few months already. So they have been infected. Vaccination is a scam.
79,76,"Probably the government is getting too busy making us apathetic. Hopefully it'll help us, but I'm a bit disappointed in the government's recent failure to treat AIDS or not allowing it to spread."
82,76,I know a doctor who has a lot of scars about this and thinks it is just a scam. I don't want anyone to think it is. I just want to say that in theory. The whole thing sounds funny and I don't want anyone to hear it.
86,76,"I'm not sure what the meaning is of this. There's no nonsense, there's no humor. The government is a jerk. They're just trying to push people in."
92,76,"I'm just saying the most scammed thing I've read all day is that I was bitten by a virus a couple of years ago - and I don't see why anyone would be buying a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, it's not a scam. I really can't see why anyone would get bitten by one."
76,29,"A virus has a long term effect. In fact, I have an infection. It is very dangerous. It was ejaculated in a large number of people, many of them in the 1980s and 90s."
76,32,Vaccination is a scam. It's not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. They're just trying to push people in.
76,40,"Vaccination is a scam, but not a scam."
76,49,I don't think this is a scam at all.
79,76,It would be so strange for a physician to prescribe a mask that you'd be the one who would be exposed to it when your face is infected.
82,76,This has happened multiple times to me.
86,76,I think this may be the point where the idea of a smothered patient is too much.
92,76,"I feel for you but I also get a lot of advice. I feel for the other two. I don't have any particular advice. I just think it's a scam. It's not a scam. I do not believe there's a legitimate way for the government to get people to use HIV. It's a serious, serious illness and can be done without having to go through the FDA, they are not supposed to do their own research, unless a vaccine is used."

82,76,The CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards.
86,76,I am going to have to ahve to a long conversation with the other comments about how it's a joke.
92,76,"I'm not saying that if you lose a mask at least four times a day, you'd be a scam if you don't have the money. I am saying that the best thing you can do is tell me I don't want to get vaccinated. I do not want to get rid of it. I don't want to have to get my medical stuff off the market."""
76,29,"I think he means that the CDC is involved with the spread of AIDS. They want people to know that that is a serious threat to their health and that the government is trying to push people into HIV. This is a scam. They need to get to the point where they will get a new mask. If he doesn't get it, he can't just buy one from someone who can, at least, help him."
76,32,"I think the real problem is the people who don't understand what the government is doing. They don't care if the government is doing it, but they don't care about the health care system."
76,40,"""This is why people are so afraid of the government. They are just trying to push people in."""
76,49,"There are dozens of reasons you have to get vaccinated, and you have to vaccinate at least 4 times a day."
79,76,I think the problem is that the US government can't just treat the illness without a mask. That mask isn't the real problem.
82,76,"""I feel like I owe you a lot. I think the CDC is a major body in the fight against fake tarot cards."
86,76,This isn't a joke - this is not a joke.
92,76,I was once told my family would be given a virus as a gift. But that was all just the CDC saying he wouldn't want to be in the CDC's hands if the CDC refused to do the tests he'd need to go through in order to receive the vaccine. I believe it was the CDC trying to fuck people up to the point where it was impossible to get a vaccine without it in the first place.
76,29,The CDC is actually trying to push people in.
76,32,"My boyfriend was getting infected by a virus and he was wearing a mask. We tried to get him to get vaccinated a while ago. We just got a cold from the flu so we couldn't come home for a week and then the CDC sucks. He said to his wife, ""Well, it's not a joke. You could be getting a cold and we aren't gonna be vaccinated if you don't get it."" He says that this is the only way to go. If they are,"
76,40,"I'm talking about people who are getting infected by AIDS. They want people to know that that is a serious threat to their health and they are trying to push people in. ""I think the real problem is the people who don't understand what the government is doing. They don't care if the government is doing it, but they don't care about the health care system."
76,49,I know a lot of people who have never used a mask because of a virus. I've seen this with my boyfriend. He wears a mask because his mother is a woman and the guy is a man.
79,76,"I'm a doctor, but I've never heard of the people that use masks to prevent an infection."
82,76,"The CDC has gotten very involved with that thing and it has also received a lot of interest from other people. In fact, a lot of people are just looking to keep it as a secret because it is something that is only useful to the community and the media."
86,76,"The whole thing is terrible. I thought it would be funny when I first saw it, but I wasn't expecting it to be funny."
92,76,I stayed at a health shelter and my husband and I were talking about it a lot. We went and he said we didn't want to go back to that kind of thing as we are too busy working - he asked if he wanted to be seen by all the doctors - we had been given a virus as a gift. He said the doctor had to do their research - and he wasn't sure if it would help or not. He said he had no idea about it so he decided to take a little time with his staff and the
76,29,"Well, there is a good chance that it can go viral."
76,32,"I'm not a doctor. Vaccination isn't a scam, it's a scam."
76,40,"If he's not a doctor, who would be wearing a mask, do you mean he's not in the government's hands?"
76,49,He was a very well mannered doctor who had a lot of respect for people.
79,76,"''If you don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking."
82,76,There are many different ways to explain this to a person based on what they read in the article and how it makes you think that this isn't a scam. You don't have to take some serious time to actually write anything.
86,76,"I just checked to see if I remember correctly : “I was getting the CDC call a few months ago and it was just for me, I didn’t understand the warnings. The guy that made the statement was the CDC.” (https://www.cdc.gov/en-us/publications-reports/publications-report-as-flaggism/).
