5,4,wholeheartedly agree in the last weeks i have had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask
22,5,i flew for the first time since march it was mostly fine but some folks wore their masks as chin slings i have glasses and wore my mask over my nose for hours and they didn t fog up i also had plenty of oxygen over the nose people
23,5,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
30,5,another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask don t be racist and don t support d nald tr mp
47,5,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
52,5,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
70,5,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
90,5,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
96,5,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
5,4,"Ingraham did not get the warning, he said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside."
22,5,So the first step is for me to wear a mask.
23,5,Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection.
30,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,5,You can't do anything but a mask. It's useless.
52,5,Its the same thing as getting out of a mask. They eat that.
70,5,The ad is saying people who don't wear masks are in fact more susceptible to a virus than a normal person with a mask. It's very sad to me that a lot of people are now vaccinated and are seeing the truth.
90,5,i have a bad day. i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
96,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
5,4,Then we get to decide what we want to do with our lives and make sure all of those kids get the right to be safe.
22,5,>The government seems to want to protect people and not protect the public.
23,5,"TWitchcon is the worst one in the U.S., I don't know if that's true for every other state. The state of Ohio is the only state with mandatory masks, but unless you have a vaccinated party in your family, they have a right to be protected by a valid vaccinating law."
30,5,"So, here is the sarcasm: the government tells you not to vaccinate your kids because of this, but because you're not vaccinated."
47,5,> I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
52,5,The one and only in that case. They're just stupid. You're in the minority.
70,5,This is a very good idea.
90,5,"It's scary how dumb they think all of is are. Little blue ones are completely useless.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage."
96,5,The OP just wrote a post and now this comment is all i hear.
5,4,Vaccinations are only a federal law that states that adults must wear a mask at the time of an infection. You can't do anything but a mask. Its the same thing as getting out of a mask. They eat that.
22,5,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I was there, and if that's what you mean. The president is an idiot. He is an asshole. It doesn't really matter how much you wear your mask. It's really just a mask, but you still have to wear one. Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest thing"
23,5,"""It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."""
30,5,"You mean you have to wear a mask because you're sick and can't breathe in a fluid while you are on the street? Well, your mother is trying to make you think that the US doesn't do anything. The government doesn't have a problem with not having the health care system to address the problems that it does - it's the only way they get them to do their job."
47,5,I'm going to try to explain to you why this is not what the message was:
52,5,"""We're the only people who do not want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"""
70,5,I can't stand this.
90,5,">Is this some kind of thing or a condition that would have prevented your vaccination? I'd say that it sounds like you are a public health professional with boosters and that it is illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated."" The problem is not that I don't have one, it's that I have to be able to do the work, but that I can get a vaccine and be able to vaccinate my kids. I don't think it's a very good idea."
96,5,"Isn't he wearing a mask for health reasons like if the virus is spreading through you, your body and you're experiencing an infection?"
5,4,Why is it so bad he needs to get one?
22,5,"In short: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I was there, and if that's what you mean.'] (https://www.gov.gov/news/news/emb.html) It's not a nutjob but a fake joke. Essentially, a mask is nothing and has no purpose. It's part of a government initiative to protect people from an outbreak of a virus."
23,5,"I'm not a lawyer, but this guy seems to be joking."
30,5,Why don't you just stop reading?
47,5,"I'm a doctor. My ENTENT was a major issue. I was only just about to get an infected. He was an anti-viral activist, and it's not exactly uncommon for people to wear them. I think that's why there isn't a mask in the US."
52,5,I don't have a mask. I wear it on the weekends. I do it on the weekends.
70,5,I don't know if you are a doctor or spokesman but you are more susceptible to a virus than a normal person with a mask.
90,5,"I don't think it's a good idea. I do think it's a bad idea to snort a cigarette while wearing a mask. I'm a vaccinated person, I'm a vaccinated person with boosters."
96,5,"Well, you know, when I was in elementary school my dad told me he didn't like the fact that he was in a mask for a reason, and he didn't want to say anything, he decided to wear a mask and a hoodie. He said, ""Oh, you can't just wear a mask all day. It's an old rule. In fact, it works. You're a hive mind."" I remember thinking, ""Oops, I don't even see the point in wearing a mask. You"
5,4,I’m gonna call the cops. It’s an insufferable amount of time that we spend talking to people who don’t wear masks.
22,5,"I don't think the president's 'war on AIDS' is true. It is not. If the government was a joke, it would've blown up, and I think we'd've already had this discussion."
23,5,"""I'm not sure why they're calling it a scam, they just haven't come up with something about a virus yet and have to make it up to their own people."
30,5,I'm gonna take a look at this and read it again.
47,5,"I don't know why I was in a mask. If you get sick you don't have a safety issue and if you do you need to wear a mask. But if you get sick you don't have a safety issue. You can't fucking wear a mask in a mask, if you do, you need a mask. So you wear a mask, and you should wear one, because the problem is with people who want to do it, not a mask."
52,5,"If you wear a mask on the weekends, it's not a joke. It's an issue for the people responsible for bringing in HIV/AIDS."
70,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,5,"I think a lot of people don't realize that they can get an A+ vaccine without being vaccinated, and they probably have the same vaccine as they can get without the A+ and the A + and that's probably a good thing to have for a child. It's actually not very effective, though."
96,5,"I think a lot of people overreact and retort the petty joke, just because people don't understand how to use a mask. The thing with a mask is that it's a way to protect the shit out of people who wear it. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is happening, so they're really the ones making the joke."
5,4,[NAME] (https://www.gov.gov/news/news/emb.html)
22,5,"The whole ""war on AIDS"" thing has gone on forever. It's so easy to get a sickle and kill someone, but a real life one doesn't need to do that."
23,5,Its kind of strange the only way to protect yourself from a virus is to just have your mask on if you need to get vaccinated.
30,5,"I had to get vaccinated because I was sick, and that was the reason I didn't eat it."
47,5,So you're like... a tarot card?
52,5,">We're the only people who do not want to wear a mask. Why don't we?"", ""I don't have a mask. I do it on the weekends."", ""If you wear a mask on the weekends, it's not a joke. It's an issue for the people responsible for bringing in HIV/AIDS."""
70,5,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,5,"It was a bit of a misinterpretation, but I don't think he meant that snorting while wearing a mask was a bad idea, that they would have been able to get rid of the vaccine after putting the A+ into the vaccinated person's mouth. That was part of the problem with vaccination, and the other part of the reason they are putting the mask on is because he is not a vaccinated person. If he were a public health professional, would that would be a bad idea?"
96,5,"...and then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think any of this is true, but this is an awful way to explain this to someone."
5,4,I feel like the other comments in the thread are just as terrible as the one from the original post.
22,5,This hasn't worked in the US for 10 years.
23,5,"People that haven't been vaccinated have never been vaccinated, yet. That's just one example."
30,5,I'm a little ashamed of all this because I was not vaccinated.
47,5,This is an interesting question. The way you phrased it you can't do anything but a mask'' seems to be that it's a scam.
52,5,AIDS is an inflammatory disease. That is not a real threat to anyone. AIDS is not a real threat. It's an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
70,5,"I'm the best person I know. I'm a woman with a mask who can eat, and I do it."
90,5,I would love to know who would be able to get a vaccinated child without a mask.
96,5,"""...and then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
5,4,"I'm actually quite surprised how people respond to that in an attempt to explain why they have a choice: 'I'm not sure what to do with your life, unless I've got to' or 'what is your job?'"
22,5,It's not a nutjob but a fake joke.
23,5,I think it's just the fact that it is a part of the system that is making a point of people being shit on.
30,5,My mom's face blew up while I was trying to tell her why she shouldn't have been vaccinated.
47,5,""" ""...but you should wear one, because the problem is with people who want to do it, not a mask."""
52,5,Apparently it's a joke. It's a'smoking a joke'.
70,5,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,5,"Vaccination is not illegal, but a good idea to prevent. The CDC won't enforce them."
96,5,As a man I can say that I'd be uncomfortable with wearing a mask if I had the chance to be funny but I'd probably slap an indignant sexy sexy thing in the face.
5,4,"I'm an ill-fated little guy and I'd rather not wear a mask. My life's too short for a snort and I could never handle it. I can't even handle any other kind of AIDS/HIV vaccine. My dad had a baby, and he could've walked around with a bag of AIDS patches and gotten rid of the AIDS in the house. I'd rather not wear a mask and not go out into the country if I could."
22,5,I know the feeling of having to wear a mask for fear of getting sick. I don't think there's much I can say about how the government works and not wanting people to be around you.
23,5,Yeah. Vaccination is not a vaccine. It isn't a prevention drug. They are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks.

It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.

70,5,">We do not have to give the President a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."
90,5,It's not illegal to make the masks you buy. The ones you get a free dose of are a joke. I agree with the memes.

22,5,The joke isn't the actual joke. It's the ad campaign that says the government is helping prevent the spread of a virus. The idea that the government is helping to prevent it is a fake joke.
23,5,The article's just about a tarot card.
30,5,Vaccination isn't required. The CDC should have a say on that.
47,5,I'm pretty sure that's what the joke was.
52,5,Vaccination is an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It sounds like the most fraudulent way to put your hands around your body in an attempt to ward off infections.
70,5,"I have a phd in AIDS, i'm getting vaccinated"
90,5,"I don't think the ""Making people sick"" meme is a meme at all."
96,5,Having a nosey eye doesn't mean I'm wearing a mask and a hoodie for a job. I'm wearing a hoodie for a job. I can't wear a hoodie when I'm running.
5,4,It's a little funny but I'd rather be a man.
22,5,There is a lot of hype about this.
23,5,It's not a joke. It's an actual question. It's a prank.

47,5,> I feel like this is the kind of joke that is based on a r/MitchFan and is pretty typical.
52,5,"Vaccination is a joke because you can still have HIV or have an infection, if that's the way you do it."
70,5,I don't understand why anyone doesn't wear a mask and that's why it's a joke.
90,5,You don't have to snort while wearing a mask.
96,5,"In the article, they have said ""I don't see the point in wearing a mask. I think it's just a way to keep people from knowing what is happening. The thing with a mask is that it's a way to protect the shit out of people who wear it."""

22,5,"The question is: why would you wear a mask in public? If I did have any sort of information to get a vaccine I'd wear my mask with no issue. If they can't be a joke, then it's a joke. It's not a joke."
23,5,"I mean, is that a joke or a joke?"
30,5,I had to get vaccinated because I wasn't good enough with my fucking hml. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to afford that kind of insurance. Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination isn't required. The CDC should have a say on that. Vaccination isn't legal to make kids get vaccinated. I don't understand how the government is using this to get people to vaccinate a virus?

I could not go to school with the mom of a man who wore a mask and his mother, who doesn't wear a mask. It was my father who had the job. It was him who told me to put on the mask when I was in elementary school. I couldn't see it coming unless I asked her why, but that's why people think it's a"

90,5,"I was vaccinated, but still don't have a cigarette so the idea is not about the snort. It's more about knowing the snort and the snorting if you need the snort. It's about getting sick, but not the vaccination."
96,5,"I've never had anyone say I could put on a mask at work or at the office. I get really pissed when they say ""I don't think people are going to slap me while I'm running."" They just make a joke and then I'm gonna say, ""I would slap a shit in the face while I wear a mask."" (Remember that shit?)"
5,4,"The issue isn't whether a mask is legal or not, it's a way to prevent infections and spread of a vaccine. The problem is the people who wear masks. If they don't have a mask they shouldn't even be allowed in the office."

70,5,"It's not a prank, it's a prank."
90,5,That's an interesting take on the problem. A mask has no mandates. It only works when someone is sick and doesn't have boosters. It is still illegal and does nothing.
96,5,"Honestly, I think it's pretty cool because this guy wore a mask to protect him and I think the joke is a very strong one."
5,4,The issue is that the mask is a way to prevent infection and spread of the virus.

52,5,I read this in a book called Is Obama wearing a mask a joke?
70,5,"So the CDC isn't really the problem here, but the president was a prankster when he put on a mask."
90,5,The CDC does have mandates to vaccinate every person imaginable. The CDC doesn't mandate anyone to vaccinate. It is the government's job to prevent and prevent any disease from spreading.

30,5,I have a tarot card with me and I can't read it so i don't need to know a word. Vaccination is a joke if the government makes it illegal for people to use it. I think it's a joke about how they're shaming the government because it's a joke and that's a joke
47,5,AIDS isn't a joke because the government wants to use it. It's a joke because it is a joke and not an actual joke.
52,5,It's not a joke. It's a joke because people know he doesn't do the right thing.
70,5,The fact that it's a joke
90,5,I would love to know who would be able to get a vaccinated child. It's actually not very good idea.

30,5,"If I wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t have had to buy a mask. If I didn’t have to go to the doctors, I wouldn’t have taken a medical course. I’d be afraid to get a vaccination. If I wanted to, I would have to go."

90,5,"And as a doctor I'm sick, because if I put my hands in the throat, I'm vaccinated, so if you let me snort, then I have to get the vaccine... So my throat will be more effective than my throat... Besides, I am sick of it, and I will not get a vaccinated child, which makes me a little ill. I have a problem with being sick of it. If I are sick I'll go see the doctor on a vaccinated person, it would be my responsibility"
96,5,In what year was the last time anyone wore a mask to work?
5,4,"> If I was not vaccinated, I wouldn’t have had to go to the doctor. I’ll go to the doctor on a vaccinated person, it would be my responsibility In what year was the last time anyone wore a mask to work?"
22,5,The government is working to make money by doing something it isn't a crime in the US. It is a legitimate medical procedure. It is not a crime in the US. Vaccination is not a crime in the US.
23,5,Then it is a joke. They are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks.

70,5,"""The CDC is using a tarot card to make a joke that isn't funny. That the President is a prankster with a mask is just a joke. Apparently it is a joke."""
