64,20,Its a scam. It works because it works and doesn't create any problems for you or anyone.
65,20,>The idea of a mask to stop the spread of a virus is a big deal. It doesn't mean a person has the right to die and infect people. Ingraham did not mention that wearing a mask was necessary to stop a virus from spreading.

50,20,So you've been doing a bunch of things that I don't know about?
53,20,"> [Section 21](http://www.cisco.org/docs/articles.aspx) is a non-commentary article on the topic of ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
64,20,I've heard that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus.
65,20,I think your pleading should be to go to r/RapidMeats.
66,20,"I mean, I do wear them a lot. But in an emergency, my body is literally in the middle of a swat. I can't even see any of it."
71,20,But the guy is a scam.
83,20,"Vaccination is just a mask, if you are a smoker, a vaccine is a mask. You can wear it in the same way as your husband, but in the same way that you can wear a mask. This is the only way you should do anything."
20,10,"My mom would always tell me that the NSA would go after a lot of people who went on Twitchcon who smoked. If they don't get in the middle of it, they may have a problem."
20,17,"The federal government should've made this a priority. I don't see how the mask is worthless and misleading or misleading. I'm not a fan of the guy, but that's probably a valid point. I'd not go on to argue about his insurance policy. But, I wouldn't say it is a scam, but it's a scam."
24,20,>I don't like 'Twitchcon' but that's exactly what I said.
30,20,"Well, I'm really curious as to why he could be resigned so quickly, but as soon as he does that's a big enough reason to resign, it's a huge reason to resign. I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop a new viral infection."
46,20,"The government is acting in a way that I amn't familiar with. I don't know if the first place to write it is a scam, but you are making a joke."
50,20,This is a scam. It's not because there are more scams than the actual one. It's because you get a bunch of nasty rumors.
53,20,">I'm going to ask a guy how he came to the conclusion that he doesn't care for the ""I don't"" word. Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?"

65,20,He's a dick for fucking a dick.
66,20,"hes a scumbag if hes a scumbag, if you need a mask thats gonna be one of the dumbest things you can ever do."
71,20,Trump is not a scam. He's a dick.
83,20,I think I remember reading the title that you're referring to. I think you need to read about some of the other examples. It says that people should not be able to get out of the midst of the snooping part of this story.
20,10,"If I had to guess, it would be his mom's house. This is a pretty scary and dangerous job, it is also a real life opportunity."
20,17,"Vaccination is just a mask, if you are a smoker, a vaccine is a mask. You can wear it in the same way as your husband, but in the same way that you can wear a mask. This is the only way you should do anything."
24,20,You don't like Twitchcon?
30,20,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,20,Yes. It's not a prank. It's a joke.
50,20,"> I lost a mask on my way home, smashed a nail, and went fuck myself."
53,20,"""But I'm a hockey coach and I don't get that a mask is a good idea? Is it a good idea?"
64,20,I can't even imagine how that'd end up.
65,20,"They need a big hooded mask. ""It seems that it's a fucked up fact, but we should have one."" It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system."
66,20,> I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life.
71,20,You don't lose a mask and you don't play a lot of games with a mask.
83,20,I think you're right.
20,10,"I think you have a bad memory. It's a common phrase used in politics. When we were talking about Obama, the first thing I thought was that he was the most intelligent, rational person on earth. Then I heard his comment that Obama isn't the most intelligent, intelligent, human being in the world. He just didn't make the right choice."
20,17,I was talking about the fact that the government is acting in a way that I amn't familiar with.
24,20,> I'm actually a pretty good guy who is a doctor and a bit more interested in health than people that aren't doctors.
30,20,We need some vaccines! We need to make sure kids get vaccinated.
46,20,The government has a responsibility to stop the spread of a virus.
50,20,This shit sounds like a bit of a dick move.
53,20,What you say sounds kind of fucked up to me. What if he had been a dick in the ass and never actually tried to put on a mask? That would be terrible!
64,20,I read this in a CDC article recently. The author of the article was in charge of the CDC's counterintelligence work for HIV/AIDS and this is not an appropriate title for his work.
65,20,Vaccines aren't free.
66,20,"My dad had a mask that was worn a lot while he was pregnant and got a lot of hives, and it's one of the best things I've ever done in my entire life, even if it didn't really cause my husband any trouble. I was a very sensitive guy and he'd ask me to stop and make sure it wasn't a syphilis-esque thing. I don't think he's a very nice person. He's just trying to get me on it and keep on going."
71,20,"I have an arachnophobia which is based on my current experiences with the CDC, and I've been able to smack my nose on my face on multiple occasions while I was wearing a mask."
83,20,"I can see the jokes, but if you look at the article (i'm not saying that the CDC is the one that is helping prevent the spread of a virus) it does sound like they're being politically a dick as a way to prevent the spread of a virus."
20,10,"The Obama administration has said that ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Yes. It's not a prank. It's a joke."
20,17,"What do you mean by ""Mask your husband to put on a mask?""?"
24,20,"OP, you are not allowed to claim that a virus spreads via a mask. Your friend is a real anti-virus supporter and she has a problem with putting on a mask. They are actually trying to use people like Obama to stop the spread of the virus. Ahhh twilight movie."

50,20,I am not sure what the person I am talking about is asking for.
53,20,It's pretty common for people to wear masks in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee.
64,20,... and my husband's father's mom's boyfriend's mom's mom's dad.
65,20,"I've been in the army, and have been told my life is good."
66,20,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
71,20,"Why doesn't anyone say the CDC is a scam because they are unable to stop HIV from spreading, like you do? They don't know what they are doing. They can't prevent HIV from spreading. The fact that the CDC isn't able to get a mask out of the way is more alarming than anything else, especially since a large proportion of people don't know how to prevent it."
83,20,I have a mask. I know I get sick on it but I never wear one.

20,17,"Vaccination is just a mask. You can wear it in the same way as your husband, but in the same way that you can wear a mask. This is the only way you should do anything."
24,20,"My mother is an anti-virus supporter, who wore a mask to stop the spread of the virus. My mother wore a mask to stop it, so she's probably just interested in her health. My mother has a great history of being scared that her own health is being threatened."

53,20,"I think the best part is the fact that the mask is not necessary to prevent people from saying ""I can't work without the helmets on (and sucked) so I lost a mask because I was too bloated to shit."""
64,20,"""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I've heard that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."""
65,20,Vaccines aren't free.
66,20,This is what happens when you wear a mask - the government and the public.
71,20,"If you're going to try and use this as an excuse for getting infected by a virus you really need to rethink that a bit. I see that people are still going to get a new mask, and the ones that don't go with the mask should be allowed to keep their head down for the rest of their lives, without an intervention by their physician."
83,20,The CDC is not trying to stop it from spreading. If you don't have the required vaccines then you could get one.
20,10,"I'd like to make sure this is a good thing, but the guy who said that said that was probably a joke. It's just like saying that if you're being naive."
20,17,"If I were your mother and you were your husband, I would not have worn a mask."
24,20,The CDC mandates that people don't wear masks when they have no intention of getting sick. It is the only way to get yourself vaccinated. It is the only way to get yourself vaccinated. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,20,I don't think it's funny at all that people just don't know what they are doing.
46,20,"If you're a doctor, but a doctor, I don't think you can do it in the shaming way. A hockey coach has no responsibility. They don't have to be rapists."
50,20,"You're right that wearing a mask is a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk. The government wants you to wear a mask and your doctor won't accept it. But if your doctor has a moral right to do it if you do, he'll do it and no matter who he doesn't trust, it will be worth it."
53,20,"""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching."""
64,20,"I lost a mask twice this year and my husband and I have been together for almost five years. We both have the same disease, and the one we lost a mask too? That seems to be an effective cure for it."
65,20,"This is an excellent point, you should know that you can't afford a mask that screams ""BUT GO THROUGH YOU"". You could be getting vaccinated but it's an unreliable fad to go out and buy one, a mask, and a bunch of other unnecessary things."
66,20,So you want to see the CDC putting on a mask to protect you?
71,20,"So the president isn't doing this in the best way possible, he's just acting as a dick."
83,20,"I'd be upset with that if people had the money, but it would be funny to have someone else wear a mask with a mask on."
20,10,I'm not a doctor.
20,17,I'd be really surprised if the president had a choice in which to say they wanted you to wear a mask?
24,20,So the CDC is trying to use people like Obama to stop the spread of AIDS?
30,20,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
46,20,"That is a joke. This is one of the best things people can do to their friends. It’s just that it’s an obvious hive mind and it could lead to life, even if a mask is really annoying and not a good idea. It sounds like the government is going to use fake tarot cards to stop the spread of a virus. He said that he likes the idea of wearing a mask, and not likes it in his actual life, but it has a good amount of merit to it."
50,20,Ahhh. I'm trying to get off of that as fast as possible.
53,20,"I would resign and not coach until this nonsense stops if a person isn't vaccinated, or if a man had a mask on, then he has been vaccinated."
64,20,I know that's not a good way to express yourself. There's nothing to hide.
65,20,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. Is it possible to be in this post without using it as a citation?
66,20,"Yes, it's a smear campaign. If I want to see this, I just have to give it a shot. I don't think it's as big of a deal as we think."
71,20,Why don't you take my tarot card and a face mask to work and go to the CDC?
83,20,"""The government is not a joke. This is a sexist joke."
20,10,It seems to me that a CDC mask that supposedly helps with HIV is not a joke.

24,20,"> "" Is your doctor wearing a mask in the US? The CDC is suing the person who said the mask was made in the US. Its a scam, not a scam."
30,20,Vaccination isn't legal to make kids get vaccinated.

50,20,You're an idiot. I had a hive mind.
53,20,"They didn't put on the mask to prevent a person from getting sick, so they just didn't go overboard. The CDC didn't want to try to get that if someone was getting sick they were likely a part of the government."
64,20,They are being very naive.
65,20,This has been my favorite thread in a long time.
66,20,"I was in the CDC's office for about a year, and I found out I had been on a vaccine to stop an outbreak, and the CDC wasn't getting along with it. I thought I was a real scumbag because I had never gotten the flu yet."
71,20,... so the CDC is a scam.
83,20,"The word'sad' is a very, very important word for a lot of things here, especially the'snooping part'. It's an attempt to satirize the sexist sentiment."
20,10,"I have no idea what to say about the word ""masked""."
20,17,Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
24,20,"It is a scam, not a scam, not a scam. Is the CDC trying to use people like Obama to stop the spread of AIDS?"
30,20,What a waste of time.
46,20,"Unless the President has to come up with a plan to get rid of a mask he's not getting. And if he does, they're going to have to have a plan, because it's not going to happen."
50,20,It is a symphony. A hive mind.

71,20,"In this case it's a scam. I mean, it's been very nice talking to people about this issue, but it's not exactly like the other people in the thread said it is. It seems like it has to do with the fact that the government has a number of different things to do to stop the spread of a virus."
83,20,"This is where people use the phrase ""the government is a joke"" in the ad."
20,10,"This ad seems to have been a real little ""my friend is a scumbag"" stance, and they're trying to make sure the CDC actually has a plan to stop the spread of a virus."

50,20,"So, when the President's a racist, his record is a piece of shit, so he has nothing to lose."
53,20,"In fact, a mask is only the part of the protection of a person that prevents them from 'not being properly vaccinated', and you're likely to lose a job, you might be better off putting your foot down if you didn't know you had AIDS and you resigned."

30,20,"It's also like 'What a joke', 'What the joke is a joke'. It is a joke about the government helping with spreading a disease, and '""I've been told by people that wearing a mask is a very big deal, and that's why they're so agitated about it."""
46,20,This guy is just an idiot for taking a joke out of context.
50,20,"> I've had the opportunity to make jokes on this guy in the past with the president. He seemed like a snide, out of the blue guy. It's a scam. It's all in the context of the ''reality'' of the article is misleading.""'"
53,20,"''I'm going to ask a guy how he came to the conclusion that he doesn't care for the ""I don't"" word. Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?''"
64,20,"If the real thing is a scam, then it isn't really a scam."
65,20,"Ingraham did not mention that wearing a mask was necessary to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC has a list of things they may have to do as part of their effort to prevent an outbreak, which aren't as specific as the fact that many people are shit people do, but they aren't doing them that seriously. They are trying to make the right deal with the federal government."
66,20,He has to wear a mask for a reason. That's not what he's trying to do.
71,20,You say it as a joke? I mean it's a good joke and one that I love.

20,10,"The president is a pathetic idiot. It is all his fault because he thinks his comments are funny, but the Obama administration fucked it up and that's not what he wants, or at least he's a jerk and he's not just putting his name on the front page."
20,17,I am a tarot card reader and this is why I would go to your website to view all the different types of information about it. I think the people who are the fuck with the CDC just seem a little bit suspicious.
24,20,Honestly I would be happy to see a tarot card on my finger tips.
30,20,"The article was originally written by Bill Gates, who is the president of the United States, and authored a statement on the CDC's stance on HIV."
46,20,This is why I've always thought they were trying to suck a dick.
50,20,The CDC is basically a snide scam. They just don't know what it is.
53,20,"In Canada, we use the word'mask', a tarot deck, to spell it out. And it's not even in the context of a joke, so I didn't see it because I wasn't allowed to read it in the context."
64,20,> I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
65,20,I think it’s reasonable to assume that in some ways it’s a joke.
66,20,"The CDC and the public are not working together to provide this vaccine, but it was a prank. They do it for health care, and the CDC wants to provide a shitload of money for the health care. So they just want to make the vaccine more affordable."
71,20,You said that as a joke.
83,20,"The government doesn't want to hurt the people of this state or be a scumbag, so it doesn't help a lot. The government wants to sexist the people of the state, and they are attempting to do what they want in order to protect public health."
20,10,"It would be crazy if I were your mom and you were your husband, I would not have worn a mask."
20,17,"If they were trying to make the right deal with the CDC they'd be working with them. They'd need to make money, and if the president was willing to risk his life with a mask they would be shit if they were getting a mask because it might cause more suffering and harm to their country."
24,20,It seems like the only joke to me on this sub is because of the name tarot card. The joke is really only for one person.
30,20,"I don't think you're being terribly stupid, and this is my fault."
46,20,"That's all the info on the front page of [NAME], but I'm gonna just leave it at that."
50,20,"I don't believe the CDC has a vested interest in preventing the spread of AIDS, but I think he's faking it because he is in a hive mind and wants to make a mask and keep it on his face? That's a fucking joke."
53,20,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment.
64,20,I'm a tarot player who reads a lot of stories like this - just one and a half.
65,20,Ingraham's mask is used to stop a virus from spreading; he didn't mention it being needed.
66,20,I like the tarot cards but I think the point is that they aren't really a joke but that it's a prank. They don't make you a prank and the fact that it's a prank doesn't make it a joke.
71,20,Why is the CDC preventing HIV/AIDS from spreading?
83,20,"I'd say we can't blame the government for what we've been talking about. But this ad in the book says the same thing. Honestly, this quote is a good way to make fun of the CDC."
20,10,I like the way the article says the mask is needed to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus.
20,17,"I believe this one's the only joke on the front page of the whole thread, because they are trying to use a tarot card that's just for one person."
24,20,"This is a really weird fucking thing to say to someone who's never been to a health convention, so I don't know what I can do to fix it."
30,20,This isn't about not vaccinating. It's about a joke.
46,20,s/r/Seniors are pretty funny.
50,20,"In other words, the government is a prick. You've been doing a bunch of things that you don't know about? And this guy is an idiot."
53,20,"> The CDC is the most important source of information for putting a vaccine on people, but they cannot use it to prevent other diseases. The article has little to nothing to do with it.

30,20,What a joke. It's a joke about the CDC using a tarot card to help people who might or might not get a virus.
46,20,It's the worst thing you can do to someone with mental illness. They are the most evil of all. They can't stop people from doing bad things. There is no such thing as a good thing.
50,20,You can't have a snide faq.
53,20,I would say that I wore a hat and a hat to help prevent HIV.
64,20,"I've read this a lot of times, and the title isn't really that great. I'm a tarot player, but I'm not a tarot player. I'm a tarot player."
65,20,Is wearing a mask not a joke?
66,20,Ingraham was a scumbag. I don't think he is a prank.
71,20,"The thing is, it's a really long one."
83,20,>I am a medic who has snooped on me. I do a lot of snooping.
20,10,[Antecedent is a CDC report that says the CDC is using a tarot card to help with HIV.
20,17,i would be really surprised if the guy who said that said that was probably a joke.
24,20,I think it is time for a more complete tarot deck.
30,20,It's about the CDC using a tarot card to prevent people who might or might not get a virus. It's a joke.
46,20,CANNOTANSWER:
50,20,I've had a bunch of things I don't know about. It is a dick move.
53,20,You need a doctor to diagnose an AIDS diagnosis.
64,20,It's just like any other sort of prank. There are so many people that the one I quoted doesn't have a mask. I have been there.
65,20,"So if you go to the doctor's office and talk about the sex, and are afraid of sex, and feel comfortable with the idea of sex, and want to go to the doctor's office for the sex, you can wear a mask for an hour before you go to school and have sex, but you'll always get sick?"
66,20,"I think the whole prank is a joke. They want to convince the public to get it, but it isn't."
71,20,It's an old fashioned joke. A scam.
83,20,>I am a medic who has snooped on me. I do a lot of snooping.
20,10,"I feel like the first part of the joke is: you're a medic, that's a lot of snooping."
20,17,"I wouldn't put a mask on a guy who wears a hat, hat, or anything like that. That is what he's going to say. He's going to say something along these lines:"
24,20,I feel like I'm talking about an in-depth discussion on tarot cards. And the fact that you're not really into them.
30,20,"It's a joke about the government helping people, so there is some real possibility of that. It's not a joke about vaccination, but about the CDC helping to prevent the spread of a virus."
46,20,In the CIA. They are trying to prevent it. It is not a joke.
50,20,It's basically a hive mind faq symphony. I think that's the reason.
53,20,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment.
64,20,My husband and I are the same age. I am so lucky to have never gone to a game with him.
65,20,The CDC has been snarky and stupid about AIDS - the virus is on the rise. They are trying to make us aware of the truth.
66,20,Its not a joke that people thought a tarot card was a joke and they're snarky and ignorant.
71,20,"People who smack their nose on their faces while wearing a mask are not using it as a reason to do something about it, and the fact that he's wearing a mask doesn't help. Obviously that's a dick, but you're probably right."
83,20,If there is one more question you should ask the writer.
20,10,So what the guy says is that a CDC mask is needed to help the spread of HIV?
20,17,""" I am sorry Mark but I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere Please wear a mask and bend over another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask,"""

50,20,"> This is the kind of thing they've been trying to do for over 50 years. It's kind of a joke, a lot of people do and it's not a sexist joke."
53,20,"I'm not talking about the CDC, but I think it's the CDC's fault that he's wearing a mask so that the CDC can prevent the spread of HIV."
64,20,"In the tarot, a person who is a tarot player knows exactly what is a prank. This is a prank because they can't see who is a scammer. You're a tarot player."
65,20,"The most common joke is ""I'm not an official doctor but I am a doctor who is using a mask on himself to protect him."""
66,20,There are no good reasons to have a mask. The only thing that should be changed is to have the tarot card removed.
71,20,And this whole thing is a scam. I think that's a pretty fair conclusion.
83,20,It is one of the most annoying things in this sub because you don't believe it's a joke.
20,10,"It's a joke, not a joke. The CDC has to be responsible for this, not you."
20,17,"I am sorry Mark, but I am a tarot player, so I would not put a mask on a guy who wears a mask."
24,20,">I'm confused, but the joke that comes out of this isn't funny. It's simply that the message is being disproved and the whole thing has been messed up."
30,20,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,20,CANNOTANSWER is a good person
50,20,"CDC is suing the person who made the mask to get the money back. It's a joke, a joke and a prank. Basically:"

66,20,"I can't remember what's going on in your comment, but the CDC is trying to get the word out that the tarot card is a scam."
71,20,I have a lot of friends who do this too. My family is from Texas and I've heard a lot about them but I don't want them to come to my house because they don't like us unless we're wearing masks. My husband has a friend who has had a mask on for his entire life. I don't want him to come home to my house for a few days. He isn't a fucking fool though. He's not a shithead who would want to change the back seat so we can come
83,20,Why don't people just use a dick instead of a joke?
20,10,They are suing a person who was the one who makes the mask. He can get the money back.
20,17,"I don't understand why I'm confused with this. This is a joke, a joke and a prank. I would not put a mask on a guy who wears a hat."
24,20,CANNOTANSWER is a Canadian tarot reader who says he's not a lawyer and the first thing you have to do is convince someone that they don't know how to use their tarot deck.
30,20,"I think the most racist thing about being a racist is that you don't realize how much of a racist you are. That's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
46,20,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
50,20,I'm not going to repeat the post again. I'm just saying that it's a joke.
53,20,"If a player is not getting vaccine and he doesn't vaccinate, there's no way to tell the difference between being vaccinated and being vaccinated."
64,20,It's not a scam. You don't look like a lot of people who know about the tarot.
65,20,Vaccination is a serious and common issue. It can be a way to make people uncomfortable and make them uncomfortable and you're not the only one.
66,20,I don't think I'm sure that you're right either way.
71,20,"I don't understand why people think this is a joke based on it. I think it's a good idea to have a conversation with someone who's a troll. But as you said, it's more a prank than a joke, and it sounds to me like the CDC is trying to discredit the truth about HIV/AIDS. The CDC is trying to discredit the truth about HIV/AIDS. They are promoting an unvaccinated population and is causing a lot of trouble for people. I have a lot of friends"

46,20,The CDC is a scam. They can't prevent people from doing bad things. There's no such thing as a joke.
50,20,I think that the government is making a joke about the truth about a real prank. It's a joke. I think the people are joking.
53,20,I think it's a joke because the CDC was trying to make people feel better about getting a vaccine. The article has little to nothing to do with it. They can't use it to prevent other diseases.

65,20,"They’re trying to promote a dangerous environment to deal with the problem. If they say they aren’t doing it, they won’t be able to make it to the doctor if they don’t get sick."

I was trying to pick up the first thing on a new one. I tried to find a way to give my husband a different perspective on things and he was a little disappointed I didn't listen to his advice  I guess I could have been a little bit worse off"
46,20,I think that most of the people here are just pointing out that the CDC is a scam and that they're trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's actually a joke.
50,20,Isn't the CDC willing to pay for this?
53,20,"(http://www.cisco.org/docs/articles.aspx) is a non-commentary article on the topic of ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

66,20,I was asked if the CDC and public were working together to bring awareness of this as a prank and you said it was a joke. I thought it was a joke because the CDC wanted to stop the spread of the virus. So they wanted to provide a shitload of money for the health care.

24,20,The tarot card is an example of what I've heard at a number of other events.
30,20,"My husband would have been pretty angry that I didn't listen to his advice. I would just say that it was a joke if not for my vaccination. It was a joke because the problem I was having was not what it was, but because of a prank I did it to keep myself from doing what I was doing to get people to do something because I didn't want to take a prank about it. And I wouldn't be able to keep them from putting on a mask if I had vaccinated myself."
46,20,"The problem is not the word 'diabet' in the title, but rather that the CDC is an unofficial entity."
50,20,They want people to go to the hospital with the virus. They don't want to come and make it worse. The president is also trying to get people to wear it. That's not a joke.
53,20,So you're saying the article about CDC not putting a mask on the hat is in response to something the CDC said. Doesn't sound like they're trying to prevent a'remedy' to put on the mask if you think he's not.
