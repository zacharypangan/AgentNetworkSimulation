95,69,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
69,2,It would be stupid to go and wear a mask in the middle of a concert without a mask.
69,6,We had some great things going on when I was a kid.
69,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,19,"i am so ashamed that someone like that is resigning. i know a lot of people don t have helmets, but i also want to say that i m in high school so i m gonna go to twitchcon and go to my first twitchcon, not twitchcon."
69,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,25,"In Washington DC, you have two rights :"
69,30,Vaccination is necessary for you to be vaccinated.

69,44,A guy with boosters goes to TWitchcon without a mask. He got vaccinated. So the mask is off-duty. He does not have boosters.
69,61,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,62,You are not getting mad at the state's mandates.
69,67,"I have to apologize and apologize. I'm going to say that TWitchCon is in the US, and I hate being vaccinated and not knowing how to wear a mask. Is a mask required to wear a mask?"

69,2,I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask for sports? How does it actually count if you are a doctor?
69,6,"You can't, not at all, say that you're a good person and you should be vaccinated for a good reason."
69,9,You are a victim. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You are not getting mad at the state's mandates.

69,30,I like to tell the truth about people not wearing a mask and not being vaccinated.
69,40,"Vaccination is not required in all states, unless you were vaccinated. In my state you do not have to have boosters for TWitchCon but if you were vaccinated without a mask, you will not be required to wear a mask for it to be required to be vaccinated."
69,44,"As a public health professional, I was told that I had to wear a mask to help protect my health."
69,61,"In Washington DC, you have two rights : Vaccination is necessary for you to be vaccinated."
69,62,It has not been addressed in this thread yet.
69,67,Vaccination is required for you to be vaccinated.
69,68,Twitchcon isn't a mask. It's a mask.
95,69,"i love the whole putting on a mask and then taking off the helmet thing is my favorite part of it. it's weird and depressing, but it's what i do and i love syringes in a mask."
69,2,"I've never had a problem with wearing a mask in a concert. What's a mask for? I was vaccinated, but not as a medical professional. The only time I ever got a mask was when my partner smoked and they smoked me. I couldn't wear them unless I had something serious to do. I was probably also an athlete, not a professional. But that was my first time when I was vaccinated. I'm not saying I couldn't help, but if I were a professional I would definitely wear "
69,6,This is not about TWitchCon.
69,9,This makes it clear that not only is being vaccinated but a medical malpractice lawsuit is a major problem in the United States.

69,25,I'm sure Washington State has some good laws involving wearing the masks. Vaccination is required to wear a mask.
69,30,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. I hate being vaccinated and not knowing how to wear a mask.
69,40,"You are a public health professional, you deserve to be vaccinated."
69,44,"As a public health professional, I was told that I had to wear a mask to help protect my health."
69,61,"I would rather be a hockey player, vaccinate at the game than a medical professional and probably need to wear a mask."
69,62,I was told that a mask is necessary for being vaccinated and that that has nothing to do with anything. I think I'm a little confused - how does wearing a mask actually count if you are a doctor?
69,67,"I don't see how we can actually say that it's a mask and that it's a mask, not a mandate."
69,68,I would not mind if my friend said that this is a 'fact'. He said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,69,"It's very interesting that a few people on Reddit have written about this and a few people have said that it's not fair that a politician can't force a government official to wear a mask, but that some politicians are essentially just asking for a shitload of people to put on a mask."
69,2,"There are some very good, unofficial rules that are made to prevent a lawsuit from taking place. A lot of people get vaccinated to prevent a lawsuit, but it is often not. Vaccination is necessary to protect peoples health. I'd like to be vaccinated because it is essential to protect peoples health."
69,6,It seems like there are more people on the internet that have a very specific understanding of vaccines than the ones that have medically endorsed them.
69,9,"Vaccination is required for you to be vaccinated. In Washington DC, you have two rights :"
69,19,It's not a mandate. It's a legal requirement. It's not a mandate.
69,21,"It's possible that the government isn't allowing a vaccine to be applied by any other person, but that it is not required or required to do so. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to go with you."
69,25,"It's not an event. Vaccination is mandatory for all people, and for all people who are not vaccinated, but need to wear the mask. It's not a mandate."
69,30,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,40,"I know that in some parts of the country, a mask is required to cover the bodily fluids that are in your blood while inhaling the vaccine. Vaccination is not required in all states, unless you were vaccinated. In my state, you do not have to have boosters for TWitchCon but if you were vaccinated without a mask, you will not be required to wear a mask for it to be required to be vaccinated."
69,44,"Yes, a mask is a mandate. If you're a doctor, you have to wear it."
69,61,"It's pretty cool that it's the third day that Twitchcon is on and that it's only a couple days ago, when the only thing I've noticed is that there are people who do the trick but don't want to wear a mask and want to go a while?"
69,62,"It's not a mandate to wear a mask, it's a mandate."
69,67,It's one of the very few situations I don't know if I can believe anything a politician has about that kind of thing.
69,68,"It is an event, not a mandate. It is a mask."
