73,71,OP. But I would be uncomfortable with being a game leader and not just an asshole.
74,73,I just think this is more of an ironic prank. I know it isn't necessary to be a good coach but as a coach I'm very interested in if I get a mask - and the fact that my team does not use it at all to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by trucks. Having this helmet is ridiculous.

73,31,I'm just confused. I was talking about the new masks. And the new ones. Why does she need one? Why does she need another? Why does she not have one? Does she need more than that?

73,15,I just rephrased a few words to explain how much of the problem is with the CDC attempting to prevent and prevent the spread of a virus.

75,73,That guy needs to have the courage to be brave enough to fight this shit. The government is trying to change the way the nyc government handles the whole sexism problem because he believes that you have the right to live. I think that the adage he makes is that he must be ashamed of himself.

73,31,The President wants to fight an AIDS epidemic to save the American people from infection. He wants to get AIDS to end the epidemic and will do so if it means saving everyone. He wants to get a good fight to save everyone. He wants people to be better people. The only way is to take a joke and get out of it.

74,73,"The president wears a mask to protect the players from getting a virus. I think the only way to do that is to get a mask. And it's a prank to do, because you need a prank hat to prevent it from spreading."
75,73,"So you're talking about a man who is having a hard time breathing. That's a tad insulting because he's a virologist. He's not a fool if he's being lied to and this is the kind of stuff the media wants to spread. If you're not a virologist, then you don't know what's going on.

94,73,He does not need a mask to stop a virus. He needs a virus. And the joke about a tarot card is very well made.
73,15,... s he's not on the front lines?
73,31,"...but it's a joke. A fake tarot card, and the person who wears a mask. The whole thing is a joke."

73,67,"I'm sure there's many jokes on there. Like, I'm gonna start with some."
73,71,"It's kind of old, and it's not that funny."
74,73,"I would say that if someone wanted to start a fight about AIDS, the best thing they could do would be to ask them to wear it to stop it from spreading. They would be resigning and not even asking why."
75,73,"I just realized that this is what I was thinking. It's a joke in that a lot of people think that the government is trying to help them, because they think it's a scam. It's all about the CIA's shit. I have the impression that he's the kind of person that will make sure they're actually being honest and a scumbag. But I'm not sure I'm being mean.

87,73,Then Trump could easily do something about this. It’s not about 'everyone is in the right' but about everything.
94,73,CANNOTANSWER : I believe the joke is a scam. It's a scam. The whole thing is a scam. The CDC is not allowed to put people in a mask. It’s the part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,15,nobody's saying the president is a troll
73,31,"He can wear a mask. Basically, it's the opposite of a joke. He doesn't need a mask, he needs a tarot card to stop a virus from spreading. The tarot card isn't a joke, it's a trick to stop it."
73,54,"I see that he is a fool, if the government has any legal rights to people who don't want to wear a mask, then he's going to do it. But as a president, I just want to let you know that people who don't have a mask will probably think this one's a joke that is just a joke — because people can't keep it off the ground for the time being. If someone does, then I think you're a fool."
73,67,You're gonna start with a lot of.
73,71,Yes. It’s ridiculous.
