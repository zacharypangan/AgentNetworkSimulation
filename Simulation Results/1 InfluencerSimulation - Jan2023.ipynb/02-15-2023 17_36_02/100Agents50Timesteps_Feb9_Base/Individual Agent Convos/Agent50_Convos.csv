79,50,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
80,50,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."

50,20,"I can't remember the last time I was caught with a fbi virus, but he said it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
50,21,The thing is that it's only the right thing to do. That's the way the system works.
50,32,>We lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
50,33,"My favorite thing about it is the fact that you lose your mask a lot, I'm so embarrassed."
50,37,It's been a long time since I've lost a mask.
50,42,I think you've got something wrong with the government censoring and censoring the public's access to contaminated health information.
55,50,That is my favorite. My friend is not on twitter.
61,50,I was reading this a while back and was a bit confused as to why it was that simple. It's not like we'should'be wearing a mask anymore.
79,50,I don't think it's that simple. But I am a smoker.
80,50,This whole thing is a scam.
85,50,My mom says she has no problem wearing a mask all day every day. I'm sure she'll find someone who has a hard time breathing after that.
50,7,"I'm a fan of the idea of wearing a mask. It’s just a way of saying I should not have to wear a mask. If I want to be more like someone who has a cough, I can use a mask. I want them to do something they don’t want to do. That’s why I’ve been doing a bunch of things that I know nothing about."
50,11,So if I lose my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
50,20,I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. The thing is that it's only the right thing to do. That's the way the system works.

50,32,I've lost a mask.
50,33,I'm surprised he's getting any response after that!
50,37,I lost my mask in a vaccinating coma and I still can't find my mask.
50,42,"I want to apologize for losing a mask and if it were just a scam, I would definitely do it."
55,50,"There are plenty of other states that mandate people to wear masks. There are in the states as well, but in Connecticut it's not a federal law."
61,50,"This whole thing is a scam. I mean, I could have an asthma attack if I didn't like the one thing you said? How much is it worth, to me, that wearing a mask isn't worth doing, and that isn't really a good idea."
79,50,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,50,"i would be very happy if i was black. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in"
85,50,">... I'm not so much a sick person, but I could be a sick person, at least in my opinion. What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead."
50,7,It's not just a way of saying I should not have to wear a mask.
50,11,It seems the fact that a man hasn't lost a mask has made this a scam.
50,20,So you've been doing a bunch of things that I don't know about?
50,21,>We lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
50,32,> We lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This
50,33,I know this's a bit of a dickish thing to say to someone.
50,37,I can't imagine how many people would be on Twitter and it'd be the biggest scam ever. I can't imagine how many would be on the phone.
50,42,"I can't believe this. We don't even use the word ""scam"" unless it's in the wiki page. The whole thing is a scam."
55,50,I would be suspicious. I'm gonna tell my doctor that the reason he's not wearing a mask is because the federal government wants to stop the spread of a virus.
61,50,This is pretty common in the United States. I'm in the United States and I have been wearing a mask and a mask for about 3 years now. I think it's part of the government's strategy to prevent and prevent outbreaks of viruses.
79,50,"The words that make you feel like you're in a mask and a horrible thing to say about it aren't very useful, but they're not."
80,50,I don't think that's a good ad for you to look at. There are a lot of issues with the health care system. I think the fact that some people do this is a big deal in my country.
85,50,"I was a student in college. I lost my mask on my way to work and my friends didn't care about me, it was a terrible idea."
50,7,"I lost a mask on my way home, smashed a nail, and went fuck myself."
50,11,The fact that people are wearing masks in certain places makes it pretty difficult to tell if the doctor is right or wrong and then don't care anymore. I would also suggest you check your medical records on the person who was trying to give you a warning that your doctor is trying to tell you that you did not wear a mask.
50,20,This is a scam. It's not because there are more scams than the actual one. It's because you get a bunch of nasty rumors.
50,21,He's gonna have a massive conversation about it.
50,32,I lied to my doctor about having to wear a mask in order to be protected from a virus. I can tell you this isn't a scam. Is this really the problem or is this the problem?
50,33,"I was in the US as a student in college. I lost a mask on my way to work and my friends didn't care about me, it was a terrible idea."
50,37,The US government has a big problem with health care for the last 10 years. We don't need to worry about the virus.
50,42,">... I'm not so much a sick person, but I could be a sick person, at least in my opinion. What are you going to do with your mask? If it is a scam then you are going to be dead."
55,50,> The entire government's power has been rescinded by the government. It's time to change this.
61,50,"I just don't understand why he doesn't seem to think that a mask is a good idea. Usually, people in hospitals wear one. Mostly, people that are not healthy eat their whole diet anyway."
79,50,"When I read that, I felt it was a metaphor for the situation."
80,50,You are going to get a fucking sickle pigeon on top of this? I can't even look at the face.
85,50,"My parents are so crazy. They have one of these masks at the office in the lobby and my parents are so disgusted, because they have never been around a man who is not sick. This is just such a bad idea."
50,7,The whole thing is a scam.
50,11,"""Discipline to the public is not just a legitimate question to be answered."""
50,20,"> I lost a mask on my way home, smashed a nail, and went fuck myself."
50,21,It sounds like you were lied to.
50,32,> [We lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
50,33,"I'm sorry but I'm not sure that the doctor's job was to help protect you, so his message to your doctor should be : ""You lost your mask on your way to work, your friends didn't care about you, it was a terrible idea."""
50,37,"Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a huge problem in the US. We have a lot of issues with our health care system. If you're willing to risk your health to be raped or killed by an untreated illness and make it your fault, your doctor is going to screw you up. He'll be fine, but you have to keep trying."
50,42,You have already told a doctor in the mail that it is a scam. It's one of the biggest frauds in history.
55,50,So the federal government would be in contempt to do the same? Is that just me?
61,50,So the issue isn't your mask. It's a 'war on drugs'. They're just trying to make a deal with people.
79,50,I'm a huge believer that people have the right to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus. I can only speak from experience.
80,50,There is a huge problem with this type of stuff. You can't just get rid of the government to have your health at risk.
85,50,"I'm not an expert on this, but I don't think I've heard a single kool aid."
50,7,I have this idea of having a mask for the bare minimum of 24 hours a day. I'm so sick of my mom going fuck me up a whole week. She's got it. I feel like I've been too busy with my own job to be comfortable with the fact that I'm a patient and have no money to pay the bills. I have a bit of a problem with it.
50,11,"He didn't say anything about you in the article, but I can't see any explanation for why he did that. That he's on the internet? Is that all true?"
50,20,This shit sounds like a bit of a dick move.
50,21,I just don't understand why he doesn't seem to think that a mask is a good idea.
50,32,I don't know who the victim is.
50,33,"I have a doctor who has the option of trying to get me to wear a mask to protect me from getting a virus. That's why he's such a dick. You guys are a family, so we can do the same."
50,37,"I feel like a prank call here. It's not that you have to wear a mask to protect yourself, it's just that you have to know if it's a real thing or a fake."
50,42,It's time for the government to have a different take on the issue. The US government has a big problem with health care for the last 10 years. We don't need to worry about the virus.
55,50,Is your doctor wearing a mask in the US?
61,50,"So, the main problem with this is that the government has put in place these new laws to get people to wear them, and they have nothing to do with it. I don't think you need to go there to get a mask. You don't have to wear a mask."
79,50,"It seems like the most common definition is ""diog"" that refers to a different kind of mask, but not a particular type of mask. You don't want to think ""masked"" means to be a sort of ""sick person""; it's ""very dangerous"" and ""impossibly easy"" to describe what a ""masked"" means."
80,50,I don't understand your point.
85,50,I've found a really nice guy out of nowhere who will say I'm a hive mind. I think he's funny but in a way that's not a big deal. He's also been through a lot of it.
50,7,"Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a huge problem in the US. We have a lot of issues with our health care system.

50,20,I am not sure what the person I am talking about is asking for.
50,21,"They don't wear masks in the US, they wear them on the people they are going to infect and that's a big fucking problem."
50,32,"he's a dick, he's an idiot."
50,33,>I feel like I've been too busy with my own job to be comfortable with the fact that I'm a patient and have no money to pay the bills.
50,37,"I had to re-read the headline. The doctor said he was worried about that and I have told him about it but that he is going to try to use it, and it doesn't really matter. I re-read the article and thought the doctor was just telling me he was going to try to use the same jargon on a fake one."
50,42,"You're right that wearing a mask is a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk. The government wants you to wear a mask and your doctor won't accept it. But if your doctor has a moral right to do it if you do, he'll do it and no matter who he doesn't trust, it will be worth it. He can't believe it."
55,50,"Is there a reason for the government not doing this? This is not something that should be expected. If you are a federal worker, you are in no position to prevent people from going to public health events. If you are not on twitter."
61,50,"It's not even a real thing. It's the same reason why people wear glasses in public. In fact, it doesn't exist."
79,50,"No, because you need to stop putting up with a virus and don't like it."
80,50,"Yes, but I also don't think the President is doing anything to protect you from the vile scumbags that are trying to sell the government a vaccine."
85,50,So what do you call the hive mind? He’s a real hive mind.
50,7,"I'd afk it to the news because I have a mask in my job and we're a bunch of sick people who go to public health events when there's nothing to pay for. Unless I can find one in the mail and give it to them or some other person, I'd have no problem being a patient and don't feel bad because I don't have a mask."
50,11,It's a bit like a prank call that a lot of people don't realize how well it all goes. A doctor trying to sabotage the public health system is the best solution. Having the doctor on the hook for a prank call means that the doctor has been on the hook. The government does not want people to put up with the vile scumbags who are trying to sell the government a vaccine.
50,20,">I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.

50,32,"It's a scam, a hive mind is a fucking scam."
50,33,I feel like the word 'prank' is a bit misleading and ambiguous. It's an inconsequential statement and it's not my opinion.
50,37,The president is doing everything he can to help us. There is not much you can do without your mask. It doesn't seem as if the government is really doing anything to prevent the disease and/or the hive mind.
50,42,"If I had to reread that headline I would have said, ""No, it's not a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk."""
55,50,"The CDC is suing the person who said the mask was made in the US. Its a scam, not a scam."
61,50,"""It's not even a real thing. It's the same reason why people wear glasses in public. In fact, it doesn't exist."""
79,50,Basically the same thing that I do at school :)
80,50,It's not a scam. It's a scam. Vaccination is not a scam because it is a serious disease unless the doctor tells you otherwise.
85,50,"I mean, you guys aren't just talking to each other with a mask. They're talking to one another by telling people what they think they have and they have to be more careful with their words."
50,7,"I want to say, I've heard the story in the past but not that I don't think it's possible to do it with my own eyes. I think the CDC has a pretty strong case of 'Having a mask' and 'Vetsy' is a legitimate thing to do but the government is doing nothing wrong to prevent and deter viruses and'shrug' is the best option."
50,11,"No, that's a scam. It is a scam."
50,20,"You're right that wearing a mask is a dick move because it's not a legitimate health risk. The government wants you to wear a mask and your doctor won't accept it. But if your doctor has a moral right to do it if you do, he'll do it and no matter who he doesn't trust, it will be worth it."
50,21,"What a fucking hive mind, I troll."
50,32,It’s all in the context of the ''reality'’ of the joke.
50,33,"I was in school where this was happening. I had to talk to a nurse who had had a miscarriage of the vaccination list. She told me that I would be able to afford it. So we were both in the hospital. So, I have been there too."
50,37,It's not a scam. It's a scam. They're talking about a sick guy who's not even sick enough to actually wear a mask for the purpose of protecting his son.
50,42,"... And the one thing the CDC doesn't want to do is to stop people from going to public health events because the people with boosters have been vaccinated, is have the disease passed on, which is not a dick move."
55,50,"If you are a federal worker, you are in no position to prevent people from going to public health events. If you are not on twitter."
61,50,This is the biggest joke I've ever heard.
79,50,"'It seems like the most common definition of ""diog"" that refers to a different kind of mask, but not a particular kind of mask."
80,50,I am a black American and I have to go to the doctor and a nurse to get it checked out.
85,50,"The government isn't really interested in helping with the problem but it's getting people to help, a way to get people to believe in themselves and do the right thing. It's called a 'hive mind' which sounds like a form of a 'compassionate' approach."
50,7,Basically the same thing that I've ever heard.
50,11,They're not trying to sell a vaccine.
50,20,Ahhh. I'm trying to get off of that as fast as possible.
50,21,"It's a real joke. I'm going to have to say, I've heard the story in the past but not that I don't think it's possible to do it with my own eyes."
50,32,"... i was a doctor. I had a nurse that had a miscarriage of the vaccine list, and the only person I was able to get to get it was the man with a mask and a mask. I can say this isn't a scam. Is this really the problem or is this the problem?"
50,33,So you don't think that the president is really doing anything wrong?
50,37,"I've heard about people claiming that it's a dick move for a woman to lose her own mask, which is actually a bit misleading. The article has a lot of similar jargon on the same person, but isn't accurate."
50,42,"It's a scam! I mean, he has to wear his mask twice, so yes. That's a scam. But if the government wants to stop people from going to public health events, the government does not want to help if you lose a mask. He has to re-evaluate it. I mean, that was a pretty easy joke to make. But he didn't say, ""It's not a scam. It's not a scam, because it's a scam."""
55,50,I'm a fdw worker and have been there. I don't believe in anything else.
61,50,You sounded a bit crooked.
79,50,"> ""Smothering is a sign of a failing health care system."
80,50,Are you a bit of a conservative?
85,50,">As a child I had a hive mind. So I lost my face because I wore a mask for work. I lost my face because I wore a mask for work, and I had no choice but to keep it on because I lost some flies, and the first time I tried to use a mask, it was because of cold, wind."
50,7,"""This is one of the biggest frauds in history. So the government would be in contempt to do the same,"""
50,11,"ah, you have a lot of shit to do here."
50,20,You're an idiot. I had a hive mind.
50,21,"It's not a scam, because it's not the way the system works."
50,32,"I've had the opportunity to make jokes on this guy in the past with the president. He seemed like a snide, out of the blue guy. It's a joke."
50,33,A fucking naughty man.
50,37,"> I lost my mask in a vaccinating coma and I still can't find my mask."""
50,42,I'm pretty sure they know.
55,50,"The fact that the CDC revoked their power is more indicative of the fact that the federal government is not able to prevent the spread of AIDS. If you want to go to a twitchcon that doesn't involve a mask, you need to go get a tarot card instead of the mask."
61,50,"If a government wants to rip a profit off your mouth, they need to make that deal with you first and foremost. They can go to your mouth and rip your throat. You can't just stop with a mask if you don't stop."
79,50,"I can’t think of any kind of government-sponsored or government-sponsored medical research. AIDS is probably a very small minority in the US, and the US has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the US. AIDS is definitely a high percentage of AIDS."
80,50,A lot of people in my country are getting a smothering of pigeons and a fetus. I don't really like the health care.
85,50,My wife has a hive mind. It's a symphony of a hive mind (symphony for hive mind).
50,7,"I know a lot about the system that relates to the idea that ""Having a mask"" is a scam but when you talk about the idea of it being a scam to prevent a virus from spreading in the US, that can be considered a scam if it is properly implemented."
50,11,"No, no, no. There are still many doctors in the US that do not know their job. They do not get to know people until they have a more accurate estimate of the costs associated with a mask."
50,20,It is a symphony. A hive mind.
50,21,"I'm sorry but I have a hive mind that can't be described and understood as a serious issue. The CDC hasn't revoked their power to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC has, however, apparently tried to do something to smother people that aren't properly protected under existing public health laws - but the government hasn't."
50,32,I'm pretty sure the wording of this is incorrect and the article is misleading.
50,33,"The president, as a Democrat, is very concerned for health and human rights."
50,37,>I lost my mask in a vaccinating coma and I still can't find my mask. I can't imagine how many people would be on Twitter and it'd be the biggest scam ever. I can't imagine how many would be on phone.
50,42,That is a scam. Using a mask is not a scam.
55,50,This guy is not actually a doctor. He is a woman who is in the same position as you.
61,50,"As I've been saying since reading the article, I am quite sure that this post is a bit much to nitpick about."
79,50,"People are very different, which is why the ""masked"" part is a joke. They don't need to be funny to do it, because it's not their duty."
80,50,"In my country, we do not get a full blown vaccine, but most of the patients have it. There are plenty of other illnesses, but they aren't covered by vaccines. The President is not a member of the CDC, but has a vested interest in a vaccine that helps stop the spread of AIDS. He is a racist, and his record is a piece of shit, so he has nothing to lose."
85,50,That's a good way to put it. Is it really the only way to scare people?
50,7,They have to have the right to put things on people for their own safety and comfort. That's what I do for fun.
50,11,This is a joke in which the doctor says he would be a good one. He doesn't need a mask to see if he can use the vaccine.
50,20,"So, when the President's a racist, his record is a piece of shit, so he has nothing to lose."
50,21,"That's exactly the type of stuff I think any American would feel comfortable talking to a doctor about, including them. They're not going to talk about what the CDC has done, but will just go on a trip there."
50,32,"I'm not trying to be rude or insulting, but in a way I'm trying to convey my stance that I would like to be taken on board in this thread and in other comments I'll try to take a step back and make it clear that I think this is really a scam. I'm trying to get the other people to agree with me that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the federal government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
50,33,I'd be shocked if the President were in the hospital.
50,37,"It's a scam. I'm so sorry I'm being downvoted, but here goes."
50,42,"The only problem with this is the lack of transparency on the side of the government, and the government's lack of transparency in the way that health care is funded."
55,50,I have been to many twitches. But I also have a couple. I feel awful if I go to any twitchycon.
61,50,The fact that a mask is being used is a huge red flag.

80,50,"A doctor has no business selling vaccines to you. They cant sell them to anybody in the US and they cant sell them to anyone in the US. The CDC isnt a legitimate thing to sell it, it's a scam because it helps people and they know where to look."
85,50,>'What is the best way to answer questions about a prank?
50,7,I can assure you that a lot of people are going to be really envious of this shit.
50,11,A doctor who plays this type of prank to get people to wear a mask may or may not be being targeted by the CDC based on a number of reasons.
50,20,Affirmative action is a problem because of how they control the health system and make money. People in the U.S. aren't allowed to use them because it isn't a proper method of preventing them from getting a'real' vaccine.
50,21,"""I just don't understand why he doesn't seem to think that a mask is a good idea."""
50,32,I don't know what the next part of the article is.
50,33,So this is the most important point.
50,37,The US government has been doing everything they can to stop people from using a mask. But I think it's a joke and a scam.
50,42,What's the most likely story that the president is the one who is the one to have a prank?
55,50,They’re suing the people who made it.
61,50,The CDC has a monopoly. There's not a single law that prohibits him from wearing a mask. The CDC has a monopoly on the internet.
79,50,In order to make this joke.
80,50,He is not even a member of the CDC and is a vendor.
85,50,"""I am just so sad because I lost my face because I wore a mask in the first place and my friends didn't care about me, it was a terrible idea."""
50,7,"I'm surprised that the President hasn't taken the time to do something like this before. He's been in a position to make a public health joke on a lot of occasions in order to influence the world. It is not going to be good for him, it just goes to be a little more outlandish."
50,11,I would try and ask what's the best way to answer questions about the prank?
50,20,"If you're being sarcastic, you're actually not a racist jerk."
50,21,You're not wrong. That was my thought. I was being frank.
50,32,"I feel you. I'm going to have to say this one thing, I'm not saying the president should be in charge of anything, I just haven't seen it myself. And this is just the way of thinking:"
50,33,i've been in a lot of situations like this
50,37,A prankster in your situation is claiming to have lost their mask. I don't believe that a scammer would ever give up their mask and get away with it.
50,42,"This is a lot of things that are hard to solve in a normal situation. The best way to look at this is to put a red flag. If you think your mask is a joke, you're right that it's a joke. That's a joke, huh?"
55,50,So this guy is suing the government to stop AIDS?
61,50,I have seen a couple of good tarot cards. I think one is more of a joke than a joke.
79,50,i have no idea why the CDC does that...
80,50,"Well, it isn't just the CDC."
85,50,He didn't tell you that it was a joke he just wanted to tell you about what happened in the video.
50,7,aaaaaaaand now we've got a whole lot of problems.
50,11,The idea of a mask isn't about doing something else. This is about putting a mask on and helping the government.
50,20,"It's a tad more of a joke, but it's also not a prank."
50,21,It's a joke. He's trying to put a person on a list. It's a scam.
50,32,"he had a medical emergency and the man with a mask had an emergency narcissist who lost his job because of his medical condition, is the worst kind of prankster. he is going to get a new mask, but that is not a joke."
50,33,"I don't think anyone thinks that it's a prank. It's a very interesting story. I think it's a bit of a jumbled rumor, but I do think it's interesting. The president and his associates have been very close to the truth about that. If they're not bothered to put up with it at the same time, I think they're on to something."
50,37,"I mean, do you have any knowledge of how this a scam works? If not, you can tell me that the CDC has no authority over this."
50,42,"So, the president pranks the people in his town to protect their health, and then goes back to his city in order to prevent this from happening?"
55,50,"A lot of people have to go to TwitchyCon and get their hands on the mask, but that’s not the point."
61,50,CANNOTANSWER:
79,50,"A ""mask is not a joke"" is a phrase that refers to a specific way of expressing an infection. It's usually used to describe how it is."
80,50,"A virulent virus is a virus that has no biological activity in it. It causes you to die from it, and the effects will be a virus which can be transmitted by virus. Its a very serious disease and can cause a lot of problems. If you are sick from it, it will come back as a virus and you will be the first person to die from it, and it will probably lead you to death. The only thing that would prevent that is the presence of a disease - infecting your body, and if you were in the hospital that will be going to"
85,50,"I've learned a lot from this. The CDC is not an official body of the CDC, which is why they are able to help people."
50,7,"You are talking about the whole ""having a mask is a scam."" tarot card thing that the CDC and others made about it before. It's a joke that is probably being made about a prank."
50,11,If it wasn't for a virus it wouldn't be any better.
50,20,"I'm going to say something similar... but I'm going to call the CDC the ""scam"" for making me look like a shithead to you."
50,21,"I'm confused on what that means, but if you're describing a hive mind that has no connection with AIDS, it could have been a'shame' at best."
50,32,"It's a prank, no joke. It's not a joke, and it's certainly not a prank."
50,33,A prankster is in fact a prank.
50,37,"CANNOTANSWER: A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A prankster in your situation is claiming to have lost their mask.

50,42,There's a bunch of people who say they know that it's a joke. And the ones who say it's a scam. But they don't know that it's a scam.
55,50,This is a huge piece of shit.
61,50,I would just throw some more money at the CDC.
79,50,"People have a phobia of wearing masks. What's more, if people don't smother their hands with a mask, the more prone they will be to get AIDS."
80,50,"> ""We need to move. Because in order to keep us safe, it's a big issue."", ""I love the word ""religious"""
85,50,"People often think this shit and don't understand it and are trying to make a joke out of it. If they don't get the message, they'll try to get someone to do it and they will get it figured out. If they don't, they'll just make it a joke and then turn it into a joke."
50,7,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I mean, do you have any knowledge of how this a scam works?

A lot of people have to go to TwitchyCon and get their hands on a mask."
50,11,People who are interested in trying to stop the spread of the virus may be interested in trying to stop a prank.
50,20,It is a joke. It is also a joke. I don't think this guy is a scumbag.
50,21,"I think the issue with the CDC isn't the lack of authority, but a lack of a legitimate interest in getting people to buy vaccines. It's an issue that will be resolved with the government getting involved."
50,32,This hive mind is not a joke. The CDC isn't a government agency that makes any money. It is a political organization. They don't make money by pretending to be their government. They do it to get money from government agencies.
50,33,"The CDC, and many other non-profits, are trying to prevent AIDS. The CDC is trying to prevent it. Its part of a campaign to prevent it from happening."
50,37,"I wore a mask for a while back after a trip to a shaming contest, then the government contacted me about it. They called it ""scam"" and the CDC called it ""scam"". That was a very poor call on a joke in which the CDC has been saying what's ""scam"" because they don't know what it's called."
50,42,This is why people go to TwitchyCon and buy the masks.
55,50,The guy's not a doctor. It's a fake.
61,50,"You're going to get a smack of a shit ton of negative connotations of ""We should've been wearing a mask anymore."" The article, ""What exactly does a mask have to do with the spread of a virus?"", ""The article, ""I think this isn't even a joke. It's the only thing that works, and the government has no monopoly. The only way to protect the public is to go to a therapist. The only way to protect the public is to go to a therapist."""
79,50,The fact that the CDC is not in charge of the health care system doesn't change its attitude towards AIDS.
80,50,Are you a little racist?
85,50,"No, they aren't being funny. They are trying to get people to take a joke out of it."
50,7,I'm gonna start by reiterating the first sentence: It's a lot of things that are hard to solve in a normal situation.
50,11,I can't stand the CDC. It is trying to sabotage the health system.
50,20,"People will have to wear masks and fuck themselves, but don't want to risk it, you have to be aware that people don't get vaccines and have not had one."
50,21,"CANNOTANSWER: AIDS is a disease that many people in general are willing to deal with, and has caused a huge amount of suffering in the past for a long time. They're not going to find the solution, and they're not going to find it."
50,32,"I don't think I'm racist, but when you say ""I'm trying to convince people that this isn't a scam"" - ""They don't make money because they are trying to get people to buy vaccines."" - ""I think this is a scam. It's a scam. I think it's a scam. '""I don't believe that a scammer would ever give up their mask and get away with it. ''I'm trying to convince people that it's a scam.'"""
50,33,"CDC isn't in charge of the health care system. The government is the only thing that works, and has no monopoly. The only way to protect the public is to go to a therapist."
50,37,The CDC has a problem.
50,42,The president is not going to be able to give the truth. He has no legal monopoly.
55,50,What did he say to the CDC about this? :)
61,50,That's kind of a huge red flag.
79,50,I've got a very good idea of how to use this. I think I can use a mask when trying to make a joke. I just can't put my hands on the smothering mask because they are so fragile.
80,50,The white house should talk to a white woman about it.
85,50,"There are a lot of stories about the hive mind - ""I have a little phobia but I really want to help him, but I don't want him to be gone."" (And I'll probably be able to find the book.)"
50,7,I think this is a real problem for the whole country. I know it's hard for some people to understand how it works.
50,11,"A lot of the times people are wearing masks because they're scary and have horrible scars, especially with AIDS/hepatitis. And a lot of people don't know that the CDC isn't working on a vaccine that's effective enough for people with it, and the president has no legal power over the CDC unless they've made some good progress."
50,20,I think the president is trying to convince people to stop doing this.
50,21,"a lot of stories about the hive mind - ""I don't think this is a scam. It's the only thing that works, and the government has no legal monopoly. The only way to protect the public is to go to a therapist. The only way to protect the public is to go to a therapist."""
50,32,"The point is the article is misleading. The president said something similar to this. If you're looking for a new mask. The CDC doesn't know what it's called, or how to get the new one replaced."
50,33,It's a joke. It doesn't say anything about the people who don't want to risk it.
50,37,The CDC hasn't even been in charge of the health care system. The government isn't in charge of the health care system. The president isn't in charge of the health care system.
50,42,"The only thing that is important is that people keep their noses shut and don't let the masks fly. And the masks are also supposed to be safe. So if you can't give people the same masks, then you're a prick."

50,21,The president needs to get the mask back. He can't troll it. I don't think it's a joke.

61,50,This is a very fucked up video game.
79,50,"The people saying smothering is a joke. If this were me, I'd say you know what's wrong? A tampon is not a joke at all. It's a little silly and a little absurd. I mean it's the people saying it, but the government isn't getting serious and making a joke about it is the wrong thing to do."
