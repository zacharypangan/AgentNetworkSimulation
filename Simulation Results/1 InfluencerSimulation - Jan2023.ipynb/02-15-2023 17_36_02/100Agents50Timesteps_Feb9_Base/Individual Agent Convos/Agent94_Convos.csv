94,11,The CDC has made it a habit to get in contact with people who have been in the news recently. They don't want to be a smirk at the people they're in the news with. They're threatening a massive riot if they have a mask.
94,15,So the president who did the mask thing is a joke?

94,40,I believe that a tarot card is a joke. It's a joke.

If he was not trying to sell a mask, and you thought it was a joke, then you are probably right that this is a scam. You have to wear a mask and you don't have to use it to stop it.

94,39,">""The fact that they contacted a government employee who lost a tarot card after a time out or even after a disaster is a warning to the government."""
