80,51,I believe it is the people who are most affected by AIDS who are most likely a victim of the CDC's scamming. I think we should just not let the CDC tell us that we would want to get rid of the stigma about AIDS because of how it affects us.

80,51,CDC has a massive stake in HIV/AIDS.
92,51,It sounds like the mask is a scam. It's a scam because of the virus. It's not a scam because of the virus. The CDC will never do anything about it. The fact that people are actually worried about it is what's been called a scam.

51,37,The CDC is just as good at trying to get the public to go out and support them as the people who work on that project. They get the people to vote and the people that get the public's support from the government.
51,39,"This is why I threw a fit in a restaurant, where a man walked out and told me that he had to remove the mask from the bathroom floor. When the woman came back I just asked her if she could afford to take my mask off and then said I would put it on. She replied saying that he had to wear it when he saw signs of AIDS and that he did not want me to."

80,51,"""Can you have any ad with a mask on if you're black?"""
92,51,I think the CDC is using false information about AIDS to get the money back. I'm in the same boat as you idk about being the CDC (no question);
51,21,"The thing that the CDC is doing is getting a huge stake in HIV/AIDS. They are trying to give you a false positive that you're actually sick (the HIV vaccine is actually a legitimate issue). And it is definitely not the CDC's job to tell you what is wrong or wrong, that's for sure."

51,40,"Vaccination is illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the ""Vehicle Protection Act"" which protects them from the government. That's just what they are."
61,51,"I don't know why it makes you think this is a joke. There's no ""right"" answer."
65,51,"Vaccination is a major health concern, and it is a joke. It is about not using them. It is a joke. Vaccination is not about saving lives. It isn't a scam. It is a serious disease.

79,51,Is it a joke?
80,51,I'm just trying to make a joke. I'm not sure how the guy was allowed to buy a vaccination but I know he was only allowed to sell a vaccine if he is black and still is. Is that why you should have mystico and a mask?
92,51,I really don't want to sound like a scumbag here.
51,21,I think we are a little out of touch in a lot of ways. It's hard to put together a complete list.
51,37,The truth is a scumbag.

80,51,"I don't think this is a legitimate issue or the issue of the mask. It's more about making sure people have the proper care and the chance to get their disease or to have some privacy about how they get their treatment and the effects on the health of their kids, and also the prevention of stigma surrounding AIDS."
92,51,You have been vaccinated. You have the option to keep your mask. I've lost it at least four times. This whole thing is a scam. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
51,21,>I'm not sure why it makes you think this is a joke.
51,37,I'm not going to get into this. The virus is a problem and the government is going to stomp on people with it. I'm going to tell you what a lot of people think that is a scam.
51,39,I know that it is difficult to figure out if a new drug is really a scam. But maybe you'll understand that it's not a scam to give millions of dollars worth of money every month to vaccinate people who don't get a vaccine.
51,40,Vaccination is not a legitimate health concern. It is not a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a serious health concern. It is a serious health concern. It is not a serious health concern.

92,51,"I like a bit of a joke, but I think the whole thing is really a scam."
51,21,You're not an ill health person.
51,37,This is a really good way to make people think the CDC has been misconstrued for a joke.
51,39,"The only thing the CDC does is sabotage a lot of people's health, not to mention retaliate against people who don't get vaccinated. That is, if it was the CDC, why not use it as a marketing tool to advertise a vaccine, rather than a tool for identifying a specific type of virus."
51,40,"I'm not sure that is a scam, and I do think this is the first attempt to explain why this is a scam, but I don't think it would happen again."
61,51,I'd say it's a scam. They aren't in a position to stop the spread of a virus. They're not in a position to stop the spread of a virus.
65,51,"""You are a douchebag. You're a douchebag."""
79,51,"It's not funny, it's funny, but it sounds like the CDC and the government are really working together to help the sane people with HIV. That's why they're working with a few different government programs, and it seems to be very complex."
80,51,So the president is saying that he has a phobia of a drug that causes HIV/AIDS?
92,51,"I think people here are using the term ""scam"" to refer to the medical care of people in the US. This is not to be confused with the word ""scam"" and it is actually more generic..."
51,21,"Virus isn't a scam, unless it is specifically designated to be part of the ""Vehicle Protection Act"" which protects them from the government."
51,37,I have a feeling the truth is a scam. I think it is a scam.
51,39,"I'm not sure what the problem is in the government that this is a scam, and that they're trying to make a huge amount of money off it."
51,40,So the government's policies are a tad bit too complex?
61,51,"People in the US should stop wearing masks. The CDC is a monopoly on the internet, not the health department. Its all a scam. It's a joke and not a joke."
65,51,What about a doctor that gets vaccinated for his own disease and then starts to question it and then starts to make jokes?
79,51,"I haven't seen a single narcissistic doctor in a long time claiming that she is a liar who makes a lot of jokes about her profession but I'm sure a few of them did, and I think it's kind of the right thing to do."

92,51,"I think if the CDC wasn't paying out for my insurance, the first thing I would do is buy them. It isn't a scam because they are making false claims and putting them in the public's pockets to try to protect people. It's also scam because it's a legitimate medical device."
51,21,"It's a joke. I think it is funny because people here are using the term ""scam"" to describe the healthcare system in their country. It sounds like they're all shady and they're trying to make their money off of it."

80,51,"I think the CDC is an unaffected, uninformed twat. The whole thing sounds too easy. It's a bit sad, but it's a very real issue."
92,51,It sounds like the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The government is making false claims and putting them in the public's pockets to try to protect people.

51,21,"The most interesting thing about a mask is that if you get a lot of it, it's supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It's also supposed to prevent more than just getting the virus – it can do more than stop a virus spreading. It's supposed to prevent the spread of the virus. It's supposed to prevent more or less AIDS and its largely dependent on vaccines, but it's also supposed to stop the spread of other diseases. It's also supposed to prevent the spread of a vaccine if the vaccinated person is "

51,21,It sounds like the CDC is doing something to make people look sick. It sounds like they're basically trying to make people look sick. CDC is basically trying to give out billions of dollars worth of money every month for this.
51,37,It's a sleaze when I say that you can't get the vaccine for the flu - but that sassy asshole is going to make you feel bad for anyone who tries it on. Having a mask can actually help your lungs and guts if you are a little bit irritable and you are allergic.

51,40,"You know, when this happened, the CDC was going to make a massive snarky, cheesy attempt at putting a fake vaccination on the people who got sick. They were not allowed to have vaccines on the public, but it was a scam. They did it by using a fake vaccine, which did not work. The people who got sick and had it could have been hospitalized without a fake vaccine."
61,51,"This isn't a prank. It's a scam. They're a prankster. They have no reason to change their minds about the fact that their policies are fucking stupid, fucking unfunny."
65,51,"I would definitely do the vaccation but I don't want to put up with it, if this happened to me in a public place I would be able to get away with it. That is why I'd put up with it. I do feel like it's a joke that you don't like."

51,40,"And that's one reason the vaccine isn't a serious health concern. I think it's a very valid reason to get vaccinated for the flu, especially since the CDC is an agency that is actually working to prevent people from getting the virus."

79,51,"I think it's a joke, btw."
80,51,I don't understand how this is a scam. I think it is just a hivemind rumor that the government is trying to rip the CDC off and do some shady thing and sabotage the public health. This is an incredibly difficult one.
92,51,"It's a scam to pretend a virus has spread to the wrong people. It's a scam to actually help them spread the virus, but this is a scam for being a doctor to smuggle people with HIV-related diseases."
51,21,Vaccination is not a serious health concern. It's not a serious health concern. It's a serious health concern.

80,51,"I don't really like the CDC. I don't care if they're trying to rip off the CDC or even if they're trying to sell a vaccine or not, but I think if they can't sell the vaccines it's too scary and scary to me. The CDC is a scammed company that has a monopoly on ad money. They don't want to talk about that issue."
92,51,"I have a virus, and I'm going to get it a lot. I have a viral fever, and I am a huge skeptic and there is no way that I will get vaccinated again.

51,39,"The people who are trying to avoid getting vaccinated are going to have a lot of problems, preventing people from being vaccinated. A lot of people are vaccinated because they have a fever, and the people who are vaccinated are sick because they have a virus that is spread to everyone and they are not vaccinated."
51,40,You mean that CDC is a scammed company that has a monopoly on ad money.
61,51,It's a joke and not a joke. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
65,51,The CDC is trying to make it sound like a joke.
79,51,"The CDC is trying to prevent people from using a mask, but they don't know how to use them. Clearly, it's a terrible way to describe a virus."
80,51,"If the CDC is selling an AIDS vaccine to the public, then it's likely the FDA is investigating. I'd be happy to see a doctor who can do that for free."
92,51,The first part is misleading because the CDC is giving out fake vaccines to protect people from HIV.

80,51,"I was in the military. And I'm going to get some vaccinated people into the country. I have an adecia and I am not sure what to do with it. Why do the CDC even have a contract with the CDC?

51,21,"I'd be curious about whether a person would be able to do anything on a CDC based on their past experiences and what they were doing. Obviously, it's the CDC's job to spread the virus, and if it's not an ACA. But if it's a scam, it's the government. They're essentially saying that the CDC's job is to prevent people from getting sick and that's it."
51,37,"I don't get it, it's just that they're trying to make people feel sick and be more dangerous. That's why the CDC is putting up with this type of thing? I would definitely try to tell people that it's a scam to make people feel bad about themselves and it's not good for their health."

The CDC is just putting it on because they have no idea what a mask is. The CDC is trying to push people into mental health institutions. It's funny to see that the government is trying to push people into mental health institutions. It's funny to see that the CDC is trying to push people into mental health institutions."

51,21,What’s interesting about the concept of “ask me what a medical question is” is the part of the article that makes me wonder what kind of health concern that would be a real problem to the person who was vaccinated or who did not want to.
