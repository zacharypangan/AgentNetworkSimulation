92,88,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
96,88,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
99,88,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
100,88,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
88,33,What kind of rules do you have on it? Have you worn your mask?
88,49,"You lose a mask a lot, and you lose a lot. Do not wear a mask."
88,82,I see an unfortunate case of people going for the helmet if a nipple is on the lungs
92,88,"I do it on purpose - I mean the irrational, I lost my mask."

88,33,"This is so cool, I always think that when I hear a mask on the radio a nipple is always on me, I just try to avoid it."
88,49,Is it the nipple on the lungs?
88,82,This is how people get masks — they're just an artificial mask that helps them breathe through them. The thing that is really so bad about wearing a mask is that a few people can't breathe properly in the first place (and they don't work out a lot) because of some weird symptom. There's a rule here that will not work if you wear a mask in the first place.
92,88,'I don't think anyone said it would be a scam for me if I had the money. I'm sure they would do the same shit for me. I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life. I don't think they actually wear it in a manner to stop the spread of a virus. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lost a mask at least four times a day.
96,88,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,88,I lose a mask about five times a day.
100,88,"The word is used in the movie ""My Little Little Little Blue One"". It's the one that's commonly referred to as the ""The One and Only"""
88,33,The first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that I lose my mask several times a day because my nipple is getting sick.
88,49,"I can't wear my mask, and I can't help it. It's a joke to me."
88,82,My little little blue one was released last year. I just bought one of these in 2001.
92,88,It's a really complicated thing to learn.
96,88,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,88,Is it possible to make a new business with a mask?
100,88,"I woke up with a headache after getting in my car with the loud, dark sound of smoke blowing out of my mouth. It was terrifying."
88,33,I've never even worn a mask... I see some funny people in this thread who think that wearing a mask might help them.
88,49,"They have all sorts of rules for dealing with the government and promoting a ""comprehensive"", illegal, irrational, or fraudulently administered HIV drug. If they do so you have to be aware of the rules and laws, or they'll be wrong to call you a ""comprehensive"" person for something they do not respect."
88,82,"I can tell you from experience, that the first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that I lose a mask several times a day because my nipple is getting sick. I can't wear my mask, and I can't help it."
92,88,They are all scams. They're not fools.
96,88,"I got a call from my neighbor, who is having a terrible cough and had a serious cough and she has had her first antibiotics removed and the only thing he does is cough and run. I was on a drug bus for 3 years and was told he had a bad cough and had a bad cough. She was trying to tell her friends what happened but we haven't heard back from her since."
99,88,A lot of people on this sub aren't familiar with the tarot card thing.
100,88,"If you're still in the hospital, they'll probably send you back to work and you'll be fine."

88,49,">They have all sorts of rules for dealing with the government and promoting a ""comprehensive"", illegal, irrational, or fraudulently administered HIV drug."
88,82,You need a nipple mask.
92,88,It’s like saying “I woke up a bit late to the party” for me...
96,88,...and then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,88,"It's not a scam, it's the aforementioned tarot card. Its not fake or false."
100,88,A bit like... you're telling me that you're not a doctor and that a mask will help prevent you from getting the AIDS.
88,33,"It's very interesting that the tarot card is one of the oldest tarot cards I've ever read. I know it has a few different meanings, but it's just not as simple as ""I was trying to buy a mask, but youre probably wrong."""
88,49,I would be fucking terrified to wear a mask.
88,82,The only reason for a nipple mask is because the patient doesn't have it.
92,88,"I think the point of this post is because a lot of the people who do this have no idea what they're talking about. You should look into what this CDC says about AIDS and not just how long it takes for the doctors to come back and replace it. It's not a scam, it's a scam. It's the type of thing people in medicine are willing to do and have no evidence, which is not how most people do it."
96,88,You are the first to ask if there's a way to make a joke about how this guy's mom has been having a bad cough? 'No' - but there is a way to make a joke about how she's having a bad cough.
99,88,"I mean, what's the biggest scam I see in Canada?"
100,88,"I just heard a song, ""The One and Only"" by a man who's a little bit older than me. It was the best song I've ever heard."
88,33,People are fools. They're just a group of idiots.
88,49,"Yes, you're very right. And you know what, if I were you I'd be wearing a mask if I had a bad cough."
88,82,I'm not a doctor but I read it a lot and know that this is the exact truth. There are dozens of myths that are written all over the world. It's not something that you can just read the tarot and find out what you're talking about.
92,88,So it's a scam. It's a scam. A good thing. It's a scam. It's a scam.
96,88,"- ""The thing with a mask is that it's a way to protect people who don't wear a mask. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is happening, so they're really the ones making I think it's very funny that the man says the word ""hive mind"" and it makes her uncomfortable. I wonder what it's for?"
99,88,I'm from the US.
100,88,"You know, a lot of people like to joke about AIDS, but they aren't allowed to lie about it."
88,33,What is the point of this thread?
88,49,"I think it's interesting that the CDC says AIDS is ""a big red flag""."
88,82,"In the US, that's the best thing to do."
92,88,"I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm not gonna lie to you. Is there an actual science to prove that the CDC can't test it and they don't actually do it?"
96,88,"Because if she was wearing a mask, she might as well tell her friends that she was having a hard time breathing, or she might see a psychiatrist, because they think she might not have the capacity to breathe properly, or perhaps because the doctors couldn't diagnose her, or have a good idea of what she was doing - in the name of the health or well being of her patient."
99,88,CANNOTANSWER: There's nothing more I can do - I don't like the way people do. I think it's a little sad that my masks have been worn.
100,88,"""The government is using it to combat AIDS."""
88,33,So you're telling me how sexist and stupid this is?
88,49,"""I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. But I do have a disability, and I have to be physically healthy for a year or two."""
88,82,That is a pretty common problem.
92,88,So isn't this an article about the government's approach to the spread of AIDS?
96,88,>Here's the remark:
99,88,The problem here is that the guy who made the fake tarot card is a scammer. He's probably going to end up getting a new one. I think it's a scam. It's like I'm a professional tarot reader.
100,88,"A mask prevents the spread of a virus. That is, to be fair, a really naive idea. People who aren't a doctor aren't allowed to lie about it. And that is why people don't want people to laugh about it. There are tons of people who don't want to hear that joke."
88,33,The tarot card hasn't been proven to be a fake. It is only a trick that helps keep people from trying to get AIDS. It hasn't proved to be a fake. The government isn't even able to tell who is wearing what because it doesn't matter who is in it. The masks prevent AIDS by preventing people from knowing what is happening. Rather they say the government is enabling the spread of the virus by preventing the spread.
88,49,"The CDC is using it to combat AIDS, and I'm not a doctor. But I have a disability. I have to be physically healthy for a year or two. What else do I have to do? I need to wear something."
88,82,I read a lot of tarot cards recently. Then I noticed that the CDC makes a joke about the guy who made the mask.
92,88,"OP, this is a scam. I think you're right."
96,88,"So, if I were to make a joke about a guy who was wearing a mask and his mom was having a bad cough, it would be like saying ""Hey, I think it is kind of creepy that they're putting a mask on a woman, and that makes me realize it's probably not even a fake, but rather a joke."""

88,49,That's why you're not gonna wear a mask. You're going to get an infection. The government is doing nothing to stop that.
88,82,>The CDC is using it to combat AIDS.
92,88,"I don't think you've heard the phrase ""I've seen a mask wearable for at least three times in my life. I don't think they actually wear it in a manner to stop the spread of a virus. I lost a mask at least four times a day."""

100,88,"I hear a song about a mask that was made for Face the AIDS. It's basically a song about the government using it to combat the virus, but is also an actual slur that people get on the radio. This is one of the best quotes I've ever heard on a podcast - ""We can never forget that stuff."""
88,33,It's been said by a lot of tarot readers that a mask prevents the spread of AIDS. That's why people who aren't a doctor aren't allowed to lie about it. It's also a great piece of advice.
88,49,I think that we are at a point where it's important to look outside the box.
88,82,CANNOTANSWER said wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,88,"If a doctor can’t test it, that’s not a scam. You’re probably a scammer for buying a mask for a sick person. I can see why some people are just getting sick."
96,88,>The worst part is that the people that don't know the meaning of hive mind know a lot more about their masks than they really do. They don't know anything about the fact that it is just a joke. The whole thing seems like a joke.
99,88,"The trick is to find the one that says if a person is out of luck for two weeks, you don't need to have a deck on them."
100,88,"So I can't listen to the song ""We can never forget that stuff."" and hear the rap for sure."

88,82,It's not a scam. It's a scam.

92,88,The first few snippets of the post are all from a post in the AIDS Forum where you will find the first five comments.
96,88,i have no idea what it is but i know that there is a way to make a joke about a guy who wears a mask and he has a bad cough. that makes him uncomfortable. but no one wants to talk about that
99,88,"In the context of 'Getting a mask at least four times a day.' I think the article describes it as '[Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus.''

92,88,So a friend of mine who had a cold went to the CDC and they used a mask that it was just too big to put on and she was able to get out of bed with the help of the mask. She also said she used the mask to put on her hands when she lost her dick.
96,88,[sic] [sic] (http://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/) A guy got a big break with a mask and said that it was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,88,"He's making a good point, but he's not a real tarot deck reader."
100,88,That's an incompetent way of saying it.
88,33,"This is one of the things that I want to hear as part of a weekly routine, not just as part of a weekly routine. I want to hear how I am going to be able to stand up and give my best to these people in order to keep me safe unless I go on vacation if I can't find my way out."
88,49,It doesn't sound like the CDC will do much to stop the spread of the disease.
88,82,The way tarot cards are written is that the deck is based off of what the tarot card says and in this context there are more than two possible outcomes:
92,88,"If it were a scam, I think this would be a great place to put it, as the CDC and the other health systems don't believe it's a scam."

We had some dick and I could get it back, and it didn't take too long for the CDC to tell the doctor I was a scammer. So that might have been a scam, but the fact that it's a scam is just too much of a scam."
96,88,They need to find a way to stop a person putting their mask on them and ensuring they're not putting themselves in a dangerous situation. This is not a joke.

88,49,The US and Canada have implemented laws to prevent a man from being infected with HIV.

92,88,"I'm very confused, but I really need to see what the CDC's message is."

100,88,"I had a conversation with a friend when I was a doctor with AIDS and she said that this was not a joke, but a joke about a health emergency. I think this is how people get sick because they are uncomfortable and not even able to see what it is."
88,33,"I'd like to think that this is the main point of this subreddit, which has been about the government for a while now."
88,49,He's not a doctor. But he's a professional. The CDC is promoting a 'comprehensive' HIV drug based on the fact that a few Canadians were actually able to get AIDS to a few of the people who needed them. And he knows he is a good doctor but is not a professional at all.
88,82,"A good part of the tarot deck is the fact that the person with the HIV was born with a mask, not a virus, and he got a bad rap. This is not a joke, but a joke."
92,88,I think it's a scam because you are not aware of how serious the virus is. That's why I'm in the right here.
96,88,I'm assuming this is something like [A man wearing a mask does not actually know the meaning of his mask](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/) or [what do you think about a guy wearing a mask?](http://www.reddit.com/r/adhoc_social_science/)?

88,33,"I’ve been doing the reading for about a year, and my friend said I was wrong because he got caught in a bunch of rape stories. I’m not sure how well this shit works, but it’s really cool that there is a really good chance that the government actually works on this. It’s nice tarot reading, but it seems like there are some things we can do to stop it, if you’re not already familiar with it and like how to do it."
88,49,The only thing you can do is if you want to go to a doc's office and tell them you need to wear a mask. You can't do it. And you can't do it because you don't want to. But you can't.
88,82,I know what you're going to be trying to say. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make any actual claims.
92,88,What he said was literally a lot like saying you’re going to get shit out of it?
96,88,"It’s very likely that if there are not more people in the subreddit to talk about, that it doesn’t fit into the category of “no jokes.”"
99,88,The post is referencing the fact that the person who made the fake tarot card is a scammer.
100,88,"It's probably a joke, but I don't get why people get sick. It's not a joke. It's just a joke."
88,33,"So the first thing that comes to mind is the fact that I lost my mask several times a day because my nipple is getting sick. I can't wear my mask, and I can't help it. They are all scams. They're not fools."
88,49,The man with HIV who is not actually a doctor in the US and Canada is not a professional. But he does not have the means to take HIV to a doctors office.
88,82,So you're saying it's a joke based on a joke that was made out of the deck? I thought you just thought it was a joke.
92,88,I'd recommend doing some research. It's the CDC's approach to putting people in danger. It's really complicated.
96,88,"I like a lot of things about it, but it doesn't fit into the category of jokes."
99,88,"I've never heard a story like this before, but there's a good chance this is a very common joke and it's a scam in Canada. I guess I would have a lot of fun in the US with my masks. But I'd also try to find something that's not used in a tarot deck and try it."
100,88,I would not make this a joke. I would make it a joke to those who don't want to get sick.
88,33,''People are fools. They're just a bunch of idiots. They're people. They're people.'''
88,49,"I'm not sure it would fit in the category of ""no jokes"" but I think I'm tired of being told these things are wrong."
88,82,So I see a doctor wearing a mask in Canada that said it was meant for the doctor.
92,88,"The most important thing for you to know is that if you're going to lie about it, you should actually be talking about it."
96,88,">the thing with a mask is that it is a way to protect people who don't wear a mask. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is happening, so they're really the ones making I think it's funny, because I don't think it's funny. I’m sorry, I don’t even know what it is a joke."
99,88,CANNOTANSWER: I lost a mask about five times a day. 'I lost a mask at least four times a day. '
100,88,>It's a joke because people don't like it. It’s just a joke. It’s just stupid.
88,33,What's the name of the card in the book?
88,49,So why would you do that?
88,82,>The best thing to do. I would not make this a joke. I'm just tired of being told these things are wrong.
92,88,You are the CDC. No one ever calls you a scammers and no one makes you believe it is a scam.
96,88,"This subreddit is full of people who don't know the meaning of a mask or that they don't think the term hive is a joke, and it's not funny."
99,88,">In the context of 'Getting a mask at least four times a day.', ""I lost a mask about five times a day.'Is it possible to make a new business with a mask?''"
100,88,It's a joke because people get sick. It's a joke because people don't like it.
88,33,The tarot is one of the oldest tarot cards I have ever read.
88,49,It's a joke because it's in the world's most hated comic book. I think it's a joke because people are making it easy for people to believe things like that.
88,82,">The most important thing for you to know is that if you're going to lie about it, you should actually be talking about it."
92,88,I don't think you need to be so crazy to think that a guy who is in fact a doctor that was only told one time that he was a scammer or is one of the ones that is a scammer.
96,88,"It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is not a joke. A mask is just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It's not a joke. A mask is a joke. A mask is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on, so they're really the ones making it funny."
99,88,"CANNOTANSWER: I read a piece about a man who said he lost a mask about five times a day. The story had to do with his friend lying in front of him in front of him, so it was a scam to his job."
100,88,This is the best part about the quote and sarcasm. You can't change a phrase. You can't change a sentence.
88,33,>I think the tarot is one of the oldest tarot cards I have ever read.
88,49,"So, the word 'humor' in this context is the tarot, not the joke."
88,82,">The mask is basically a tarot card that says that if a person is out of luck for two weeks, you don't need a deck on them."
92,88,"I'm not sure what you're talking about. The actual part of the story that makes the most sense is that people are able to prevent a'scam' from going around wearing the masks because of a virus, and when they get sick enough to see an'scam', they get the information and not just be concerned about it."
96,88,Isn’t a joke made up to be funny?
99,88,CANNOTANSWER : The story is referencing the fact that the person who made the fake tarot deck is a scammer.
100,88,There are some things we're not allowed to say to people who don't understand what the quote is about. It is a joke and sarcasm is a bad word.
88,33,This sub is full of people who don't know what it is. The fact that people are doing this to their own benefit makes it hard to believe. I wouldn't want to make this the big deal and start to make it a big deal.
88,49,The CDC is running a lot of anti-HIV programs.
88,82,The problem is not that a guy who is in fact a doctor who was only told one time that he was a scammer is not a fraud.
92,88,I don't have a good way to tell the story of how I lost my mask.
96,88,"If I remember correctly, you have a mask. And if you get a mask, you give it a nice ring and put it on the door, and put the mask on, and put it on the door. Obviously, it's not the same as a full body mask, but if you get it off it sounds like a very good joke to me."
99,88,>How do people always confuse the word tarot with tarot cards?
100,88,I think you're right. Apparently the quote is on the front page of the AIDS AIDS Support Group.
88,33,"I had a tarot reader get a piece of tarot a few weeks ago that I read in a conversation at a local bar with a guy who was telling me the same thing. I got it out of the box and told him he had lost a mask, and his wife is the guy I was going to have a conversation with, and it was his friend who would also say the same thing. They just kept putting it in the first place because he thought they were the guy who was going to be telling me that he had gone through the process"
88,49,"""I have not read the tarot, I am not a doctor."""
88,82,My favorite part about reading tarot cards is the fact that the card is literally one of the first things that comes to mind when I read it.
92,88,You're being a shill.
96,88,"A hive mind isn't a joke, it's just a way to prevent people from being able to see what is going on. It's just a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on."
99,88,"CANNOTANSWER. Why do people always confuse the word tarot with tarot cards? There is a huge gap between the US and the Canadian government. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US and the Canadian government. A false tarot deck is a deck that says that if a person is out of luck for two weeks, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
100,88,It's on the front page of the AIDS AIDS Support Group. The song has more to do with the issue of why it's a joke and sarcasm in a joke.
88,33,"Why can't the government work on this? The tarot doesn't help in the long run. It's a great idea. You can do it if you have the opportunity, but you have to put your foot down."
88,49,"And the guy got a mask because of the tarot card. It says that if a person gets sick for 2 weeks, he doesn't need a mask."
88,82,I want to make sure that people are aware of how it works. But I can't really understand what the reason for the mask is. I'm pretty sure it's actually a joke based off of the card.
92,88,"AIDS is not a virus. It's not a virus. The CDC is scamming people into doing their job. Because if you get sick and then get vaccinated you're not going to get a virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. The fact that people scream out ""I'm not sure what I'm talking about. The fact that people scream out ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
96,88,I would not like to live with that.
99,88,CANNOTANSWER: [I lost a mask about five times a day. I lost a mask about five times a day.
100,88,"I grew up on a farm in Maryland, and I still don't have a lot of people around me to know the meaning of the word ""Joke"" for the whole thing."
88,33,...But I have to put my foot down. This whole thing is a scam.
88,49,"As someone who has taken an HIV/AIDS test for HIV infection and is not a professional, I can confirm with certainty that your comments are based on some factual material about the situation."
88,82,"There's a video posted on r/Tarot.com which has a lot of information about this, as well as the tarot decks."
92,88,"Vaccines are not ""scams"". They are a scam. The only way to stop it from spread is to get people vaccinated. The only way to stop it from spreading is to find the best med possible, and find the best way. The only way to get people to vaccinate is to get them vaccinated and get a vaccine. But if you get sick, then get vaccinated, then you're not a sick person, so you have to get a lot of meds available. You're just a scam"
96,88,I think it’s funny that people are narcissists that don’t get to discuss the actual meaning of a mask. They are going to be upset that something that could easily affect a person’s mental health isn’t going to be made.
99,88,I think I know a lot of people who have not heard of the article.
100,88,"It's the only reason they call a joke a joke, it's why we call it a joke."
88,33,"I've never read the tarot, so i'm not really familiar with this, but it's my favourite quote from it"
88,49,I am not a doctor. I am a doctor. My life is sabotaged by my ignorance of the system.
88,82,"A deck that says ""If a person is out of luck for two weeks, you don't need a mask on them."", ""There's another tarot card called ""The One and Only."""
92,88,"The CDC says that it will help prevent the spread of AIDS, but AIDS has been causing serious harm for 15 years, so we're talking about about this, and I'll probably have to call someone out on it."
96,88,It's a way to prevent people from being able to see what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on. It is a way to keep people from knowing what is going on.
99,88,"I've read a lot of these words in books, books, tv shows, and movies. I don't know if I've ever heard anything about them, but I can't imagine my brain understanding why I'm wasting my time on that kind of stuff."
100,88,It's a joke because there is no logical reason to believe that a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus.
88,33,"This is why they make me a joke and then use the humor to lash out at me and make me sad, because that’s not how it works. It’s just that I can’t get AIDS treatment for it and that’s not a real issue to me."
88,49,I'm sorry that it's so strange that the title isn't correct.
88,82,>My favorite part about reading tarot cards is the fact that the card is literally one of the first things that comes to mind when I read it.
92,88,"So when people make that assumption about the CDC, they are claiming that the CDC can't test AIDS or that there is some real evidence that it is a scam?"
96,88,So that means he could go around talking to someone on the street in a hive mind.
99,88,So how can people confuse the word tarot with tarot cards?
100,88,The lyrics of the song are on the radio. They're a joke.
88,33,I'd say it's a good idea if they are willing to put the tarot deck in a place where people know what they're getting.
88,49,"I read the article, and I can tell you that they are using a tarot card in the context of the word ""Joke"". It's the tarot that says ""If a person gets sick for two weeks, you don't need to have a mask on them. The trick is to find the one that says ""If a person gets sick for two weeks, you don't need a mask on them. The trick is to find the one that says ""If a person gets sick for two weeks, then get vaccinate, then get "
88,82,">I want to make sure that people are aware of how it works. I'm just tired of being told these things are wrong. They're wrong, and they're not."","
92,88,"If they vaccinate people who don't know what they are getting, they can get some of that money back. That's a legitimate shady plan of action, the CDC wants to do it, but it's not working."
96,88,"People are going to know what a hive mind is, but it's going to be a joke."
99,88,The Canadian government has never had a problem with the fact that they used fake cards for anything but the purpose of preventing a virus spread.
100,88,"Yes, it is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke because it's about the truth. People with AIDS are going to find it very difficult to fight the virus. In fact, it's a really scary condition. You don't need a mask to fight it. You just need a mask. This is why people use r/aspn. This is not the time to be a doctor because it's not funny."
88,33,Vaccination is a good idea but you can't be a doctor when your mask is out of your hands. A mask is not a good thing. A mask is a good idea when your hands are in your hands.
88,49,A lot of people who are in the US are in this subreddit because of the shady plans. And this guy is one of them. I think it's a good idea if they are willing to put the tarot card in a place where people are aware of how it works.
88,82,CANNOTANSWER : I resign and don't coach until this nonsense stops. [WHERE IS THE FUCK GUY?](http://www.aspn.gov/science/how-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-to-fail-how-to-fail-
92,88,"I was born with a virus, and have lost many health care choices. It has been in my family for 20 years, and I was constantly asked for help. There is a lot more to this than just being sick, so the doctor should help me figure out the answer."
96,88,"I think it's a very good joke that is being made about how a hive mind is a joke, that's the same thing the people who hate it don't like it."
99,88,CANNOTANSWER: Getting a mask about five times a day. I lost a mask about five times a day. 'I lost a mask about five times a day. ''I lost a mask about five times a day.''' I lost a mask about five times a day.
100,88,"The joke is about trying to stop the spread of HIV, which is a big problem for many people and causes a lot of problems for many people. If the disease is something that you can't eat, I don't know what you're talking about."
88,33,I think it's a great idea if they are willing to put the tarot card in a place where people know what they're getting. I think it's a good idea if they are willing to put it in a place where people are aware of how it works.
88,49,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
88,82,I don't understand how the mask is even part of the question.

99,88,People have the right to know and have a good understanding of the meaning of the word tarot. The government can use them for the purpose of helping a virus spread.

88,49,It's a joke.
88,82,The CDC will have to use an official tarot deck to ensure that the players are protected. The fact that a person doesn't need a mask for a two week illness is an indicator that the medical professional is actually doing something wrong and is avoiding doing anything wrong.
92,88,Is the CDC a scam? Because that's how they have to respond to you.
96,88,It's a great idea and it's just funny.

88,33,I've been a huge fan of this book. But the one who hasn't read it has actually been telling me it's a scam. It seems like a good idea.
88,49,"I don't think there is any moral difference between a tarot deck and a tarot card, it just looks like a joke."
88,82,I don't really see why a doctor shouldn't want a mask on the back of his head. He is not a tarot card author. I think it's a great idea if they are willing to put it in a place where people are aware of how it works.
92,88,I don't have the answer.
96,88,"""... And then you realize that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,88,"I'm not going to lie, the people I know who said it's not a scam are just being weird, and that's why he's talking about a fake tarot deck."
100,88,"My first thought was to tell you that he's a doctor who is not only concerned with preventing the spread of the disease, but also concerned about people getting sick. A few years ago, when he was a doctor and my parents thought he was a doctor, they told him he had to work on the AIDS outbreak, and told him the AIDS is something that should be cured with a new mask to save lives."
88,33,"A lot of people in the US are putting the tarot on TV to make a joke. It's like they can't trust the people they know about a tarot deck, and not even a lot of people are interested in knowing the meaning of the tarot deck. That's not even a joke."
