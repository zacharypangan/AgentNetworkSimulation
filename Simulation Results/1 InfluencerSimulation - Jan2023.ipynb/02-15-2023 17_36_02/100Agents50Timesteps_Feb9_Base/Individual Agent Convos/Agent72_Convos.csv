79,72,You need to stop using your job as a shield against the threat of an HIV. It's the fucking government.
72,40,You need to stop using your job as a shield against the threat of an HIV. It's the fucking government.
79,72,I've had a virus that I didn't understand until I started going away and being in the military. It was a symptom of a health care problem.
72,40,This is how it is supposed to be:
79,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,40,"The first paragraph is supposed to be about the government. You can't tell who's actually involved in any of this, and if they are not involved in any of it they aren't being aware of it."
79,72,"The government is basically making this very hard, especially with all the ridiculous people."
72,40,"The government is basically making this very hard, especially with all the ridiculous people."
79,72,"And in case you haven't guessed, the CDC isn't a government agency."
72,40,"The government has no control over what the public knows about HIV, and they have nothing to do with HIV. They only control the people who know and know what HIV actually is."
79,72,"The CDC is basically making this very hard, especially with all the ridiculous people."
72,40,You don't get to see all the people who are genuinely in contact with the CDC.
79,72,"I mean, you can't just use a mask and die, you have to go to the doctor, just get a new one."
72,40,I'm not sure if they could ever actually get rid of the CDC but the public knows it's not a serious infection.
79,72,"I think there is a lot of confusion around the definition of ""smothering"", but I can't think of any sort of government-sponsored or government-sponsored medical research."
72,40,"The CDC is a government agency, not a government agency."
79,72,"It's probably because the government is allowing that to happen, rather than what they've got done with other people and the CDC has failed."
72,40,"I think there is a lot of confusion around the definition of ""smothering""."
79,72,">Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works. I'm going to go pause and say: ""Always wear a mask....but I've never tried it, but I know I've found it to be just plain useless."""
72,40,"No, it is the government that is enabling that. I don't know how that works."
79,72,The CDC isn't a government agency. It's a public health agency that deals with the CDC. The CDC is actually the FDA.
72,40,"I read this as: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works."
79,72,... and it is actually the government. I'm going to say:
72,40,Its just a way to go. My wife is a doctor so she knows they could get her own body shot. I also know she had an HIV virus and she has been able to treat it. I am not sure if they even want to have their own medical doctor or not but we have a lot of other people in the hospital so she can get help to treat HIV.
79,72,I think the fact that a new mask was invented by the US government shows it's kind of the wrong thing to do.

79,72,I am not in the military yet.
72,40,I think it's weird that I have to tell my doctor how to get a new mask. I don't want to take care of them.
79,72,"""I'm not in the military yet. I think the problem is that the US government can't just treat the illness without a mask. That mask isn't the real problem. There is a lot of racist stuff in this series."
72,40,...and it is actually the government.
79,72,"I'm afraid the article is full of snarky comments, but it is also true that the CDC has failed."
72,40,The US government has failed. It has failed.
79,72,The CDC is a public health agency. The FDA isn't. It's a federal agency. They deal with all the different agencies.
72,40,It's a pretty decent idea and not something you'll find elsewhere.
79,72,... And the title is just a joke. a rebuttal of all of the comments in this sub.
72,40,...and the title is just a joke. a rebuttal of all of the comments in this sub.
79,72,The entire CDC is the government.
72,40,Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works.
79,72,"a few sentences later, [The article](http://www.sciencereview.org/) CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It means we don't think a mask would be helpful.""..."
72,40,It sounds like a dick joke.
79,72,"I have this problem: it is the government, and the government is responsible for everything. It is the health system, it is the government and not the agency. It is not the government that is responsible for anything."
72,40,They aren't even getting rid of the CDC.
79,72,I don't see how the whole thing has been the same.
72,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.

79,72,"""Making"" isn't exactly the most adolescent humor and it has some pretty dark threads about the government, especially the government's responsibilities in this particular topic. I mean, the whole series is about an unremarkable number of people (I have the word ""Making"" in my mouth), I haven't seen much of anything in that one."
72,40,“Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don’t know how that works.”
79,72,"The CDC is not a government agency. They're a federal agency, a private one. It's a national agency."

79,72,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.''"
72,40,So I want to be the man.
79,72,"""Hey, I'm sick, but I'm not in the military yet."""
72,40,It's kind of the wrong thing to do because the government doesn't have any say in the government's decision making. We need to get some new masks and get back to the people who can't or won't accept it.
79,72,"I know, right? But the point of the AMA was to show the government is actually being a government agency. A CDC agency would be a state agency and not the federal government. They would be a public health agency with a state agency. A federal agency with a state agency would be a federal agency."
72,40,"- ""We're the government"" - ""No, it is the government that is enabling that. I don't think the whole thing has been the same. ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works."""
79,72,I thought the same thing about the article. It says that the CDC is working to prevent people from getting AIDS. Probably in the same sense as the U.S. government. It's also a tampon.
72,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage.

79,72,A new mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,40,I just came off a piece of a joke.
79,72,"We can’t just use a mask, because the government is trying to push people into mental health institutions."
72,40,"i think they think you can't really be so sure. if you want to be a doctor, and are a doctor, i would just ask you about how you could be a doctor. you might get some ideas about the meaning of a mask, and then you are left thinking you are a doctor, not a doctor."
79,72,"I am a lawyer in Washington, DC. I'm not really a lawyer or anything like that."
72,40,"My wife and I got together and got to talk about the AIDS epidemic and it was pretty much a comedy about the government. It was the CDC trying to keep people from getting sick, the government was essentially trying to keep people in the U.S. government. We have been doing it a long time, and they need to get back to the people that aren't in the CDC. We need to take a look at the CDC, the CDC and how much money it spends on treatment for the HIV patients. I'm trying to get a more realistic picture of"
79,72,"I thought the article was about the CDC, not about the CDC itself, but about the government. Considering that they do not seem to be doing anything else with that information, I would have to get on a tampon first if I could."

79,72,It sounds like you want me to tell you that he is being a little bit of an asshole and I'm trying to talk his way through the whole thing.
72,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The CDC is not a government agency, but they deal with all the different agencies."""
79,72,We're going to have to have some psychiatric tests and make sure you have all the facts.
72,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The CDC is a government agency, not a government agency. '...and they aren't getting rid of the CDC"""
79,72,Is this the right answer for you?
72,40,"I am going to go out on a limb here and say that ""As for the government, this isn't really a question of what the government is trying to do for a living. It's a question of whether or not this is a real thing. You can't say I think we can't understand the underlying concept of ""government"" but it's the concept of a government agency that has to deal with the government's priorities. I'm going to say that they aren't going to be a doctor."
79,72,What if you read the article first?
72,40,"The US government doesn't have any say over what people know about HIV/AIDS. It's just the government doing it, not the CDC, and they have no say over what the people who know what HIV actually is."
79,72,> Is this the right answer for you?
72,40,"I'm trying to get a more realistic picture of what a CDC has to do to people, but that's all about the 'Museum' and the 'Museum' a little bit more than just the CDC. I don't think it's necessary to do a ""meal"" as the person who has the AIDS."
79,72,A very funny phrase but I can tell you that a lot of people are just cynical about it and you just have to get over it.
72,40,">I read this as: ""Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system? I don't know how that works."""
79,72,>I think the whole thing has been the same. I think the whole thing has been the same.
72,40,I don't like the idea of the masks in that sentence... I think this is the best one to be given.
79,72,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

79,72,>[[NAME]](http://no.nAME.org/)
72,40,The US government has been doing it since the beginning of the 20th century.
79,72,It is not a joke. It’s a joke.
72,40,"There is a lot of confusion around what the CDC and the CDC are trying to do, which is what 'gov't is trying to do' and 'government' is actually the government, which is what 'gov't' is."
79,72,You're not joking here. This is a joke about how the government is working to prevent the spread of a virus.
72,40,"You could also say that some governments are in no position to change this, because it will cause more people to be in the country and have more problems."
79,72,"This is a very specific situation where you're essentially asking how to get your job if you're not in the military. But the article itself isn't a joke, it's a joke."
72,40,The CDC has been doing it for nearly 200 years.
