41,26,That would be an awesome way to have a public speaking engagement.

41,39,"As a big fan of the government, and a person of a certain age, this might be a good thing for the people of the world."
41,40,Its not about the mask. Its about wearing a mask. Wearing a mask as a mask is about it.
65,41,It doesn't make a lot of sense to put on a mask. The idea of a mask to stop the spread of a virus is a big deal. It doesn't mean a person has the right to die and infect people.
82,41,I'd rather that the people who wear masks do not get paid to do it.

41,3,"You don't have to be a politician, you have to be a politician and there will always be someone who will be in power."
41,13,"Its a bit like a metaphor for a car, but you see it that way all the time."
41,14,I have a problem with the people who wear masks. They're just a big fan of their own country.

41,35,"No one has been wearing a mask to stop a virus and that's just a way of saying fuck you, you gotta go. There's a lot of people out there that do this."
41,39,You've been on the right track.'
41,40,"I want a team for my son. I'm still not quite convinced it would stop the virus. But, it's only about it if it's dangerous and if I'm not, it's not about the person. The problem is the mask is a health scare. It's not about what's actually going on, but what's on a person who isn't going to go around doing it."
65,41,"It would be fun to wear a mask and walk up to someone for a moment, but then you would have to be extremely careful when you were going to get in."
82,41,"So what? I can't speak for everyone, but I'm in the minority."
95,41,"There's a great book titled 'The Man Who Got The Virus,' by Robert F. Devine, titled the ""My Man Who Got the Virus,"" which is about how masks are used to stop the spread of a virus."

41,14,"They have a right to not wear a mask, but he also wears a mask to keep the flies from getting there."
41,17,What does the government have to do with the virus?

65,41,"I don't really think the federal government should put a ban on putting on a mask, a lot of people don't think there is a problem here."
82,41,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
95,41,"There is no real excuse for the government not doing anything that would make you feel safe, especially not the one that you want to help, but that's just the way it is."
96,41,Yeah that is a hard time to understand. If they want to keep putting on masks they have to have people who wear masks. Until then I'm not a guy and I don't even see the point in wearing a mask. I don't even see a problem with wearing a mask.

41,13,This is a really naive and naive idea that people have to be in their right to not wear a mask.
41,14,"There is a lot of controversy over what the word mask does, and how a mask is necessary to help stop the spread of a virus, and this issue is why they can't do it."

41,39,I know it sounds like a funny and funny thing but I'm not sure what to say.
41,40,"I know this isn't just the news but a lot of people don't really believe it. A lot of people are a bit dickish, and I don't think the government really cares much."
65,41,"I've been working in a doctor's office with a pulmonary allergy so if you ever need to be vaccinated it would be more likely you'll need a respirator or a nasal mask. In a hospital I could literally just use the ""vaccinated"" part."

41,2,"This is the most obvious thing about the government and how people are perceived and how their actions affect people, because people don't just wear a mask all the time, and the government does nothing wrong. There's an enormous amount of information available online about how the government treats the medical profession in various ways, from the people involved to the people themselves. It's a pretty shitty thing to say."
41,3,I wear a mask to keep my face off my nose.

41,14,I'm a doctor. My favorite part is the part where I've never even been in a doctor's office.
41,17,It is a sappy way to describe the kind of stuff you would normally wear all day.
41,21,"In all fairness to the guy, I would never go out without a mask."
41,25,It is so far from being a real life thing. I'm not sure if there's much more to this world than what you described. There's literally nothing I can say to justify that kind of behavior.
41,26,I'm trying to get in a good relationship with this guy.
41,32,This is a lot of naive and funny things to say.

65,41,The idea that a mask can kill bacteria is the wrong thing to do. It's also an issue for insurance companies because there are literally nothing to be ashamed of in the process. But the problem is that that's not an excuse. It's a fucked up fact.
82,41,"I think this is a scumbag thing to say, and I hope you think that’s the point."
95,41,"Unless he was a doctor he is doing absolutely nothing. This virus is not the same as having the face on your face. He just told him that he's smothered the virus, if he's not comfortable with a helmet or using a mask and doesn't want to use the face, he will be screened."
96,41,That's an absolute garbage comment. People are fucking a bunch of people.
41,1,It is an excellent thing to ask a doctor or a lawyer. I can't help you see the link but I feel like this is a good place to start.
41,2,[NAME]: I'm not sure what to say.
41,3,"I think a lot of this is just a weird thing that i don't understand. Those are both valid reasons for wearing a mask, but are you interested in finding out more about how people in these countries feel about them?"
41,13,My favorite part of my job is where I'm in the office. It is a sappy way to describe the kind of stuff I would normally wear all day. It is a pretty shitty thing to say.
41,14,"It's not the whole story, it's the only way to do it. The first thing you need to know is that, if it were me, I'd tell people to fuck it up. And you can't tell them to fuck it up. It's just a weird way of looking at it."
41,17,This guy is a bad friend.
41,21,It sounds like it's not funny at all. I've never even been in a doctor's office. I'm a doctor.
41,25,I think the question is whether you are naive and funny about this because there are plenty of people on here that think that being a doctor is a health scare? Maybe it is because the government just wants to stop people from being sick.
41,26,I'm trying to get in a good relationship with this guy.
41,32,It's a scumbag thing to say.
41,35,"I’d love to see some evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease, even if that means taking a mask off and being comfortable without it."
41,39,He is an idiot. Not a doctor. He has a bad habit of being smothered by a virus and then telling them to go home. This man is trying to make a career and hasn't done a good job of doing it.
41,40,This is why I have to wear a mask.
65,41,"You can fucking hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates. I'm sorry, but I've never seen anything like that in a public place."

41,39,I'm sure there is a story here. It's not a joke.
41,40,I don't see why he is being a dick and not a doctor.
65,41,I don't know about you but I'm a guy in Canada. We had a guy in the hospital who wore a mask when he got sick.
82,41,It’s the one thing that’s funny about the tarot cards I have.
95,41,"The only thing I can remember from this movie is that it was a long list of jokes. I actually like wearing a mask, so I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. It's also a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the virus. It's also a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the virus."
96,41,"Why should people wear a mask? Or the word ""hive mind""? Because I don't think people can just wear a mask all day."
41,1,As a former hospitalist I would say they're making a lot of money selling the “shrugs” so the government is essentially giving away information to keep the people safe and not to interfere with the health of the people.
41,2,"'... I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. It's also a good chuckle for people who aren't into the twilight era, who don't know enough about the virus. Why should people wear a mask?"
41,3,"It's not an answer to your problem, but it's the answer."
41,13,I am a doctor and I want to tell people that I am a bit of a dick. It is not a good thing to make the public feel safe.

41,21,I feel like I was a bit dumb. I don't wear the mask because I don't want to... but I don't like it because I want to be a doctor.
41,25,People can make it very hard for people to just not wear a mask all the time.
41,26,We are gonna get downvoted for this but I'm not even that sure about the point.
41,32,"I had an aunt who wore a mask to get her children's vaccinations. She was in hospital and had a horrible bout of a flu like the ones that are mentioned in the film. She wore a mask to go to the hospital and take care of her children. I did not want to be with anyone else. She was just so uncomfortable I'd say go to the doctor. I wore it because of the fear of infection, but didn't like the smell or smell."
41,35,I really liked the movie “The Matrix” a lot but never made it to the sequel.
41,39,"There's a lot of people that want to get sick and die on a tv show and wear masks. There are some, like, doctors that have been around a while but not as much as the people who are currently in the field. It doesn't make it a joke. But it's a good thing."
41,40,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
65,41,I agree with what everyone else has said.
82,41,I have to say this to my lawyer as well as the other people. They're very serious people and I'm sure there's more to the story than I'm trying to get the whole thing out of context.
95,41,I hate that you were so excited to hear the joke. I can't believe this is still true.
96,41,What about the word 'hive mind'?
41,1,"I'm a doctor. I don't understand a lot of the jokes, but I also think the 'hive mind' is just a silly way of looking at it. It's a joke, but the story is interesting."
41,2,"It has nothing to do with the morals of the story, it doesn't matter how much it hurts others. I want to put down that it's a great joke."
41,3,> Why should people wear a mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,13,I think the point of dressing as a doctor is that it makes the people uncomfortable and makes you uncomfortable. I think the point is that people can be in the right to be safe. The point is to be able to see the health implications and the effect it has on you.
41,14,"I'm going to be very brief and not joking, but I know the meaning. It's going to make people feel awful and if that person is uncomfortable with it then they're more than welcome to wear it."

41,25,I'm really surprised there's actually no point in thinking that people who get sick on TV is a doctor. That's the point of this post.
41,26,"I wore a mask when I was in a medical school. Then I was a little nervous because the doctor told me the vaccinated child had already been sick. Then I started to think, ""Hey yea, I've got to go get a helmet""."

41,35,"I think it's a great way to encourage people to work out in order to prevent diseases. The movie was amazing and I'm glad I did, because I was in such an unhealthy position if they tried to stop the spread of a virus."
41,39,"I had to see a doctor a few years back because it really didn't matter. He got into a very deep depression and I felt really stupid for that, but I still knew I had a serious case. And he blew his brain off the couch."

96,41,It's a joke.
41,1,The movie has a lot of jokes about the government trying to stop the spread of AIDS and the people's lives. The movie is the story of how we can prevent HIV in people and stop them from being able to get that vaccine.

41,26,"It's a great joke. The joke is the ""We are gonna get downvoted for this but I'm not even that sure about the point."""
41,32,What's more ridiculous is the fact that there's a government-mandated vaccine campaign that was funded by the CDC. That's pretty stupid.
41,35,What if you were in a hospital and that's the same doctor who did the doctor's job? The doctor is the only one who isn't a doctor. I guess it makes you want to be a doctor?

65,41,"I'm a doctor and if someone asks me why I want to be in a hospital wearing a mask, I'm going to be the one to tell them to tell me that they will never wear a mask, and I’m afraid they will get sick."
82,41,A lot of people on here say this.
95,41,I like the part that's pretty cool. I think you're joking. What is this joke that you like?
96,41,They put on a mask because it makes people less likely to talk about how they think they have to get the hive mind.
41,1,"I would say he isn't comfortable with a mask because he can't talk and is worried about the fact that the government doesn't want to change peoples lives. That is a shame, because it's a joke."

41,17,The mask is not a joke. It's a way of proving that you are a doctor. The doctors are more concerned with saving lives than they are about preventing the spread of the disease. They are more concerned with saving lives than any other profession.
41,21,"I think that your comment is too twisted. The idea of an ""indeed, I'm not sure if you have a job, you can be a doctor and keep a mask on when you go out with friends"" comment is also very silly. If you do not have a job, and you don't wear one, it's probably to keep a mask on you when you're out with friends."

41,39,You're going to need to make a TED Talk about this a lot. It's a great opportunity for your community to support your goals.
41,40,This is probably one of the few times I've seen a doctor wearing a mask. I would suggest that you call it a mask.
65,41,People are sick because the government is acting like a devil.
82,41,"In my opinion, I'm very familiar with the tarot, and have a strong feeling that tarot is just as good as actual tarot. It's a logical way to get a positive effect in your life. But then again, in your opinion, I have a hard time understanding how to get the facts straight."
95,41,My nanny asked me the same thing that happened to her and I told her that my daughter is sick from AIDS (as opposed to having to keep it off the field) despite her being at a hospital and undergoing treatment. It was a long list of narcissistic snark about the CDC addressing her skepticism and the problem causing it.

41,13,I’m not going to tell you anything. I just want to say that I don’t think people in this sub are assholes as they are. I can’t find anything about a doctor wearing a mask. It seems like there is a certain sort of resentment for the government. The president was on a med school assignment and I got a'real' job doing the same thing I was.
41,14,"The mask does not help prevent infections, the public knows exactly what it is and doesn't care to find out the reasons behind it. It's just a weird way of looking at it. The first thing you need to know is that, if it were me, I'd tell people to fuck it up. And if he's not comfortable with a helmet or using a mask, he will be screened.

41,25,"It's been pretty good. I think you're pretty funny. This is a joke, and the thing that makes it all the more funny is that the joke is so funny that a guy who gets a mask is only a little bit funny and a little funny because of the hive mind."
41,26,I don't see how a doctor can say this without putting on a mask. It's more like a metaphor for a car. I see how that might be useful.
41,32,The CDC has a right to not wear a mask.
41,35,"You're joking. I'd like to see some evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease, even if that means taking a mask off and being comfortable without it."
41,39,I'm sorry but there is not one or enough evidence to support a comment. It was a joke. It's a common joke and it has been for a while.

Then, if you're worried about the effects of a virus, ask your attorney to explain it to you. I think you need to reevaluate yourself for this. It is a very serious disease. Vaccination is the best, most effective way to treat it. Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam."
95,41,"It was a joke, the joke was not funny."
96,41,"I have an issue with people not knowing the meaning of their masks. I know many of them don't understand it, I know it sounds horrible, and I know I have had the same problem. But as a man who wears a mask and a mask all day, I know it's a joke."
41,1,"I've read more than a few quotes based on this stuff, but you're still making the most point. The hive mind, not the mask."
41,2,I think the only way to know what's going on is to think that they're just joking.
41,3,oh and that one person is the most likely person to die from a virus?
41,13,"It was a joke, and I get that it was actually a joke, and I agree, he is probably going to do it again."
41,14,"It's a joke. Rather than be funny. Hence, why the joke. It's not about the mask, it's about what it does. It's about the people who are putting on it and talking about their health problems. That's not what it is."
41,17,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They have a legitimate right to prevent it. It's all jokes, but we don't owe them anything. They're going to need a new one soon."

41,25,"I don't get why people would think that is funny, just a joke. You're right. It's a joke. But the thing is, it's actually a joke. People don't wear masks all the time."
41,26,"There are some of the jokes that you mention, as a non-smoking way of expressing yourself, but don't take it seriously. And there's a lot of people who think it's funny."
41,32,A doctor with AIDS was in the hospital despite the fact that he wore a mask. He can't afford to get screened. He could be doing what he wants in a hospital environment and will eventually go to hospital and not risk getting sick. He has to wear a mask. But then the people who actually wear a mask don't have to do it.
41,35,This is just a joke. This is a joke.
41,39,"You are trying to make the CDC a ""tarot"" who is trying to have a positive impact on people."
41,40,"Unless it is actually a joke, that's probably not a joke."

82,41,"I had an actual tarot card once, and the doctor was shocked to find it in the store!"
95,41,"I'm a big fan of David himself. I'm an avid hockey player, and have been a regular at the CDC for a long time. I like how he was such a wacky person and very friendly."
96,41,I'm not going to give you the facts on this. But it was an interesting tidbit that I figured it'd be useful if I just stopped asking questions and started putting in my own thoughts. It's not a good idea to take it to a third party that is trying to tell you that it is a joke. It sounds like it's a little vague and vague.
41,1,"""I'd rather that the people who wear masks do not get paid to do it. So they just call people a team, and if they don't do something wrong they are a team?"""
41,2,People don't know the meaning of their masks. They're not sure what it means. They're not sure what it means and what the meaning means.

41,13,I don't understand why people don't know the meaning of the masks. I know some people don't. If there is a 'team' to help them there's a reason. I would say people on the CDC have a right to wear a mask and not a mask. But they also have a right to keep themselves from getting infected. It's not the same as having a face on your face. It's not the same as not being able to see the other way around the doctor.
41,14,AIDS is a very serious disease and Vaccination isn't a scam. They have a legitimate right to prevent it. Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam.
41,17,[It's not a good idea to take it to a third party that is trying to tell you that it is a joke.
41,21,"People wear masks in places like the hospital, schools, etc."
41,25,I think the purpose of a mask is to make it uncomfortable and makes people uncomfortable because it is part of being a doctor.
41,26,"I'm sure that a lot of people in the public sector are pretty good at jibbering about people wearing masks, too."
41,32,...but then the people who actually wear a mask don't have to do it.

However, in order to prevent spreading of this illness, a doctor is also required to wear a mask that is a mask that is not designed to help prevent and control the spread of this disease."
82,41,Vaccination isn't a scam. A scam is a scam.
95,41,"I've also heard of this movie, and that the CDC is the real culprit."
96,41,A good part of the jokes in this sub are about a guy getting a break with a mask.
41,1,"Vaccination is a scam. It's the only way to stop it from spreading, so it isn't a scam."
41,2,I'm going to end this.
41,3,"I was in that movie for a year because I couldn't remember what the joke was. I would laugh at it as an example of a very normal situation, and I couldn't keep an eye on it for a long time because that's what I would look for in the movie."

41,17,Is there a part of the story in your post that's still relevant and interesting to you?
41,21,I don't think it's a joke. It's just a joke. It's not the most 'fun' way to use the tarot card.
41,25,"I'm going to start writing them down and give them to my parents. I'm going to be the one to tell them to tell me that they will never wear a mask. That's the point of this post."""
41,26,"I think I’m going to ask the other person out there who’s the best friend I know about a person that is really sick and having AIDS, how is that a good way to end a life? If I wasn’t dead in a room with a fake tarot deck and an AIDS AIDs, I wouldn’t wear a mask. It’s just a way to get around being sick without it and still getting sick."
41,32,I have no idea what this is about.
41,35,"i mean, if you haven't seen the movie you're joking."
41,39,It's a joke. It's a joke.
41,40,It is a joke. You can't force your partner to wear a mask.
65,41,"No, the government is trying to make people more aware of the AIDS epidemic. They're trying to make people more aware that they can get a vaccine but don't have the funds to pay for it. There's a lot of nonsense."
82,41,CANNOTANSWER said wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,41,No. You are not the one getting that kind of a joke.
96,41,I think we're all going to have to live with these jokes.
41,1,"There's literally nothing wrong with wearing a mask. I mean, he's not actually a doctor or a lawyer, and this isn't actually a joke. It's just a way to avoid a conversation and to avoid a negative conversation with the person who's actually in your situation."
41,2,"AIDS is a symptom of the US being more aware and taking care of the virus than most other people. In terms of the real problem, this is something that I have to deal with in the future."
41,3,Because we've been around all the tarot cards and are getting so far away from the people in need a bunch of them. And now a lot of people don't get to see them so it's not so important that anyone on the outside sees them.
41,13,AIDS is a very serious disease and Vaccination isn't a scam. They have a legitimate right to prevent it.
41,14,AIDS is a serious disease and Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam.
41,17,"[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination isn't a scam. A scam is a scam. I've also heard of this movie, and that the CDC is the real culprit. A good part of the jokes in this sub are about a guy getting a break with a mask. Vaccination isn't a scam. A scam is a scam.

41,21,I think this is the only sub where I can give the best explanation to my friend.
41,25,"You aren't wrong. The government has a long history of stealing people from their families. They are also being able to eat and drink when they get sick, but are not able to protect them from being infected by the disease."
41,26,AIDS is really getting out of control. I just want to know how much it's getting out of my system and how it works.
41,32,I'm not saying a mask is a joke. It is a way of saying the people who actually wear a mask don't have to do it. I'm saying this because they are being naive and not a joke. It's not going to stop AIDS or to stop people from getting vaccines and it is going to stop AIDS.
41,35,I would say it's the best way for you to live.
41,39,"I've heard of one of these posts, and I'm not sure what the joke is."
41,40,"It's a joke if you want to be a chemist, and it's funny for me, but it's not a joke if I want to be a doctor."
65,41,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a serious health concern. They're trying to make people more aware that the government is trying to create a dangerous environment to deal with it.
82,41,"I'm a chemist, so I want to try this one one - I'm afraid I'll be the only one to have to explain it to my lawyer, because I'm a chemist, so it's a bit of a bit cheesy to try and figure this out."
95,41,CANNOTANSWER: You are the CDC. That is a joke. The only thing you need to know about the CDC is that it is a joke.
96,41,"'We have an issue with people not knowing the meaning of their masks', 'They put on a mask because it makes people less likely to talk about how they think they have to get the hive mind.'"
41,1,Vaccination is a scam.
41,2,There is an important distinction in that I think it is in a lot of ways.
41,3,So what I'm saying is:
41,13,"I don't think you're being sarcastic, but i think you're being sarcastic if you're being sarcastic if you're being sarcastic if you're being critical."
41,14,I agree with him. This is the joke you are getting.
41,17,"The CDC is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They are merely trying to help people who aren't sick. They're trying to convince people to get vaccines for AIDS, but they're focusing too much on protecting people from AIDS and they're making sure that people can get the vaccine they want. This isn't a joke."
41,21,What is it about the tarot cards that makes me uncomfortable to wear them?
41,25,I think that some people get sick because of their masks. It's a joke.
41,26,I think it's a good idea to put a mask on and help to keep people from thinking about it a bit.
41,32,"I think the reason for this is that I do not really have a choice between a mask and a tarot card, especially since my job is to warn my friends about the risk. I also don't believe the government's policy of keeping people vaccinated is the case here."
41,35,Vaccination is not a scam. It is a way of saying the people who actually wear a mask don't have to do it.
41,39,"There is not a reason that the government should not have put in place anything, but there is a need for a government tarot book."
41,40,"I'd say it's a joke because it makes people less likely to talk about the hive mind. I know I would be a bit sorry if I were you, but this joke is just a joke."
65,41,"The fact that it is a joke and you are fucked by the government seems to be a sign that you're a moron, too. I like to think it's a good idea to wear a mask and you get to have a conversation about it, but it's not as if it's being made up."
82,41,Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. It is a scam because the scammers aren't actually trying to stop people from getting vaccinated. Vaccination isn't a scam.
95,41,The movie is a joke about the CDC trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
96,41,">'We have an issue with people not knowing the meaning of their masks, and people being narcissists that say the term ""hive mind""?"
41,1,Vaccination is a scam. It isn't a scam because the CDC is trying to help people get vaccinated. They are trying to convince people to get vaccines for AIDS. They are trying to convince people to get vaccinated. Vaccination isn't a scam. It is a scam because the scammers aren't actually trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The movie is the story of how we can prevent AIDS and the people's lives. The movie is the story of how the government is being vested in place
41,2,"The only reason I can consider a joke is because it's a joke and I don't believe in the CDC. They are attempting to get rid of people that actually get the vaccine. The CDC is a scam, but they are trying to convince people to get the vaccine."
41,3,"The CDC is not trying to stop AIDS, they are merely trying to help people in need. Vaccination is not a scam. They are trying to convince people to get the vaccine they want."
41,13,"I think it's good that a bunch of people do it as a way to avoid getting sick, as long as the mask doesn't cause any harm or harm, and that there are people who want to do it and would rather not do it than being a total scumbag, but the mask would be a good way to get a grip on a situation."
41,14,Vaccination is a scam. Vaccination is a scam.
41,17,CANNOTANSWER: You are the CDC. That is a joke. The only thing you need to know about the CDC is that it is a joke.
41,21,"I like the ""Masked for Life"" kinda joke, but I'm more interested in reading the jokes in it.', ""I think the ""I think there's a lack of evidence for this 'hive mind'. It's all a joke."", ""I think that some people get sick because of their masks."", ""I think...I think people should have a more rational understanding of the government.'"""
41,25,Vaccination isn't a joke.
41,26,"""We are gonna get downvoted for this but I'm not even that sure about the point."""
41,32,"I am a huge fan of the word ""hive mind"" because it's the most common term I've ever heard and you may be thinking of the term ""sake"". Then again, it's a little odd that it comes from so many different words..."
41,35,"My mom is a very talented physician, and I like her work. Her job is to warn her of the dangers that can come with being vaccinated. Her work is important to me because it is a great and important part of her job. So, I am going to get vaccinated, but the time to go get me is not right for me because I do not like the stigma of having a mask unless I’m going to be able to help her with her illness."
41,39,There's a lot more to this world than just those people.
41,40,The fact that it's a joke is just a joke. I think that's the way to describe it.
65,41,"""You don't like that the idea of wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,41,The CDC is trying to deter a lot of people from getting vaccinated. It isn't a scam. Vaccination isn't a scam. They are trying to make it clear that they are not scammers.
95,41,There's a joke about how they can't stop the spread of AIDS.
96,41,I'm a little confused. Does this mean that a lot of people are saying you can't just wear a mask. Or that you can't just wear a mask? Because that's not a good idea.
41,1,"I agree with the other comments here, but I've never been in a situation where I don't think the government really cares."
41,2,The CDC is trying to convince people that they are scammers. They are trying to convince people to get the vaccine. Vaccination is a scam. They are trying to convince people to get the vaccine.
41,3,A lot of people say that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
41,13,"I just wanted to say that I don't think people in this sub are assholes as they are. The only reason I'm not going to tell you anything is because I don't like the CDC's job, which is to try to stop the spread of AIDS."
41,14,The joke is a good one and it's a scam. It's not a scam. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. And it's just a joke.
41,17,"They want you to know that you are a doctor, not a scammer"
41,21,I'm a doctor and I do this a lot. My job is to help people who are sick and I'm not worried about the hive mind.
41,25,"People are also very hard to fool with. A lot of people think that a hooded cop has AIDS, that's why they keep going to the gym to try and avoid it. I think it's because the government is trying to convince people to get vaccinated. It's all a joke."
41,26,"There's a lot of people in this sub that aren't in a position to be a joke about the CDC, but they seem to be making an effort to get them to stop the spread. Vaccination isn't a scam, as much as it isn't trying to stop the spread."
41,32,I'm not sure the proper meaning isn't there in that sentence. I would make a statement and reword it and say it in an eloquent way.
41,35,"This is a joke. A joke that is just a joke. It sounds like an exaggeration. It's a joke, but the actual joke is a joke. I don't think that it's a joke."
41,39,"No, the CDC is not a scam, they are trying to change this so that they can get people to get the vaccine."
41,40,"I don't know what to think now. I am just asking for clarification about how a ""hive mind"" would have the effect of a ""Hive Mind"", and I don't think I'd find that as a joke, but I find that it would be a bit strange to take the word hive mind a step further, but I don't think that is what that is."
65,41,i am not a doctor and i don't really like the idea of wearing a mask. I'm a doctor and i have been told before by people i work with to tell me what to do for me in the hospital
82,41,"Yes, a lot of people do. I want a tarot deck, not a mask, and that's all a scam."
95,41,"I think you are making a great point. If you want to make a great point, you should do that."
96,41,It is not a joke.
41,1,"In fact, I would say that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus, and because it's a joke, it's a scam."
41,2,You are joking. I don't want to say you are being joking. I don't want to be joking.
41,3,"The point of wearing a mask is to show the people in need of the vaccine and to show that the government has an important role to play in preventing the spread of HIV. That's a joke. It's a joke. They want to give a lot of people a voice in a situation, but they're trying to get the government to stop the spread of AIDS. This is a joke."

41,13,I am not a fan of this sub. I've posted a number of articles and articles about it. I can't even believe the CDC's trying to prevent HIV/AIDS.
41,14,I would think that's something that would happen if the government tried to get people to get vaccinated? Is that a joke if it happened if they tried to get people to get vaccinated?
41,17,"CDC is the real culprit. I'm very sick of all this, and it's scary that it doesn't make sense to say that you are a doctor. Having a mask for your illness is a serious health concern.

41,25,AIDS has been very dangerous for people and there is only a small percentage of people in the world that get AIDS due to a mask. I believe the CDC and the CDC have a history of having a history of getting AIDS.

41,21,I've read a lot of tarot cards and I think it's pretty common to wear them on the job to be a doctor and they're often a joke. I'd say it's probably because people in that sub think it's funny and not because they know the joke or are ok with it.
41,25,I don't think the government is able to actually do anything. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. They need to stop it and stop it before it is a problem.

41,32,There is a difference between a joke and a joke.
41,35,So the moral of the joke is a bunch of jokes and one can tell the story and pretend like a doctor. But the other is a bunch of stories and pretend the people who are actually going to have the health problem are really serious.

96,41,"So when the doctor told him he was going to get the hive mind and had it on, and he was being honest, he's going to say something about how the virus would get into his system, how much is he relying on other people's health? He says he would be doing it all day and not a hive mind."
