68,30,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that

91,30,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
93,30,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
96,30,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
30,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,7,"Yeah, that makes sense, but if you are being racist, they aren't bringing you here or aren't getting the message. They are getting this message from the people who know nothing about the politics of vaccination."
30,9,"Yes, we need to tell everyone that our parents, as adults, should not wear masks. It's not racist. It's really not necessary for a parent to be vaccinated, but is very important to a healthy child. The health system needs to teach us that vaccines aren't the answer."
30,14,>Dald tr mp was behind a guy at eleven who was wearing his welders mask
30,15,"I was in the US at the time, and I had my mom give me a mask, and she wore it in public. I went back to school with her, and then told her to take the next one. I asked her if she was OK with it, and she said no."
30,16,"Isn't it just me and my wife saying that we need to know what to do to prevent this? And if we can't, do what we want."
30,17,"In that scenario, you'd have to wear a mask. What about a t-shirt?"
30,19,Is this an American thing?
30,20,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,27,"ah yes, you're so fucked. I think you mean 'another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask don't be racist and don't support d nald tr mp'. I don't really agree with it either."
32,30,"The government says ""I have to wear a mask so that I can have a better night."

49,30,"And the bloke is going to be on the field next year, he is a bit sick."
52,30,"This nonsense doesn't sound like an issue of morality, it sounds like they have an agenda. The point is that this nonsense will continue to be the basis for the Trump administration's manipulation of our society and our current state."
66,30,You mean you have to put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then take it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
68,30,Is there a link to an article that says it's ok not to wear a mask? I find it very odd that a person who gets a mask wears it so many times a day that they have to do that in order to work on the job.
69,30,Vaccination is necessary for you to be vaccinated.
91,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,30,"In fact, the first episode of Season One: the Making of a New Life with a Mask, I lost mine at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."

30,5,"So, here is the sarcasm: the government tells you not to vaccinate your kids because of this, but because you're not vaccinated."
30,7,Well the message isn't really being used. It's still racist if your parents wear masks.
30,9,"If this sarcastic comment is going to work, I'll rephrase it: ""My father had the choice to keep a mask on because I thought it would suck"""
30,14,I think we need to give the parents a better idea of what they should be doing and how to behave in this context. The government doesn't do this. They do it because they know that a healthy adult can't help themselves.
30,15,This has been so long since you talked about this.
30,16,"> It's really not necessary for a parent to be vaccinated, but is very important to a healthy child."
30,17,You mean you have to wear a mask so that you can have a better night?
30,19,"Well, your mom is trying to make you think that the US doesn't do anything."
30,20,"I would say that if a person isn't vaccinated and the government wants to cut back on vaccine use, then the government should not allow it."
30,27,The government doesn't have a problem with not having the health care system to address the problems that it does - it's the only way they get them to do their job.
32,30,In a very similar situation where the government insists you have to wear a mask to protect yourself while you're wearing a mask. They're basically obligated to wear one during the day because they think you're being obnoxious to people.
48,30,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things
49,30,"Unless she gets the government to make it safe, it's not a problem."
52,30,You don't even have to wear a mask. You have to wear a mask because you're sick and can't breathe in a fluid while you are on the street.
66,30,You mean you have to put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then take it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
68,30,The first sentence is incredibly misleading. The people who don't wear masks are essentially giving their lives away.
69,30,I like to tell the truth about people not wearing a mask and not being vaccinated.
91,30,"Is it a bad thing? I mean... there is a good reason to be upset. I'm not saying you're not uncomfortable, I'm saying that you can get better."
93,30,"I feel like they're trying to make this look more and more like the real thing. I've had a few dummy masks for my life, but I've found that the ones I'm using are the ones that really hurt."
96,30,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
30,5,"You mean you have to wear a mask because you're sick and can't breathe in a fluid while you are on the street? Well, your mother is trying to make you think that the US doesn't do anything. The government doesn't have a problem with not having the health care system to address the problems that it does - it's the only way they get them to do their job."
30,7,> They do it because they know that a healthy adult can't help themselves.
30,9,"I mean, you said it, because I thought it would suck."
30,14,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So, here is the sarcasm: the government tells you not to vaccinate your kids because of this, but because you're not vaccinated."
30,15,"Unless you're a doctor, they can't prevent your kids from getting sick, you can just get sick and get a different one."
30,16,I just want to make sure the hivemind is on the same page.
30,17,I'm sure you can get over this.
30,19,"I'm so sorry about your mom, but I've heard the same things about you: The government is trying to get rid of your kids. If you want to be a parent, you can't be vaccinated. The government wants to cut back on vaccine use, but they don't. That's why the government is in the position of not doing anything."
30,20,"The best thing a parent can do when the sick kid isn't vaccinated is wear a mask. If it's a problem, they will want to make a mistake."
30,27,You can't tell the difference between having the government give you one and your parent wearing a mask.
32,30,Its the most common kind of thing you can do in America to prevent a new virus.
48,30,"> I am really curious as to how he could be resign so quickly, but as soon as he does that’s a big enough reason to resign, it’s a huge reason to resign, I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop a new viral infection.

66,30,"He's not a fool. If he were a fool, would he be a fucking moron?"
68,30,"If I can't afford to pay for a mask, I'm gonna wear my mask and wear it. It's also very uncomfortable, especially if you have a hs or a family member that doesn't know to put on the mask."
69,30,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. I hate being vaccinated and not knowing how to wear a mask.
91,30,>I don't think there is any single other example of the actual point of wearing a mask
93,30,I've seen this in the movies. The way I feel is that I'm afraid I can't hold my mouth shut or anything and it makes me feel worse.
96,30,"This is a terrible thing to say. You know this post is fucking awful, but isn't this a joke? Like, ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing my mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing my"
30,5,Why don't you just stop reading?
30,7,>The best thing a parent can do when the sick kid isn't vaccinated is wear a mask.
30,9,"I don't have a lot to add, but I have to say that there are some things the government needs to do to improve their health. For instance, their health care system needs to be reformed, because the government doesn't care about protecting people from being vaccinated. So a little bit more than just saying this is bad for you is enough to make a joke."
30,14,"In my experience, you can't protect the people you're trying to protect."
30,15,"You know how the joke works, it's just so dumb that it's completely useless. It's a joke. I can't stand a sarcasm or just a stupid joke, but if it were me, I'd like to stop talking about it."
30,16,This is why people wear masks. It's not like they're supposed to have to put a mask on for anyone but the kids to see a doctor about an illness.
30,17,"Yes, the government is a naive machinist. Vaccination is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus."
30,19,It's not racist. It's not just a joke. It's a common mistake.
30,20,"Well, I'm really curious as to why he could be resigned so quickly, but as soon as he does that's a big enough reason to resign, it's a huge reason to resign. I guess he should be working on a mask in order to stop a new viral infection."
30,27,I think you should see a doctor who works in healthcare and the fsu.
32,30,What are you asking about? We have all the laws we have in place to prevent that. Is this a thing?
48,30,>A good coach will be the one whose responsibility is to protect the players and their teammates from being hit by a truck. Wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
49,30,"> The issue I'm referring to here is that I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on at all. In all honesty, I am not sure I ever got a valid reason to put the mask on at all."
52,30,"He's making fun of that one joke, and he is ignoring the fact that it's about his kids, but not about preventing the spread of the virus."
66,30,"Because the US has a lot of ""dicks"". That's the truth."
68,30,You're probably more likely to die after an infection if you wear a mask if you don't know to wear it. :)
69,30,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,30,I don't want to be a moron. I don't want to be the dumbest person on earth. I don't want to be a moron. But I do want to be the best person in the world. I don't want to be a moron. I'd like to be a moron. I'd like to be a moron and go out to eat some fucking shit. I'd want to be a moron for my whole life. I want to be the best person.
93,30,"I'm also afraid to eat weed, but I've had to go through the chemo thing and just get the mash for a few days now, so I'm going to go with a gummy."
96,30,"It's weird, but not hilarious."

30,7,"You know that the truth of the joke isn't the joke, right?"
30,9,"This is pretty silly. I read it as ""I know how the joke works, it's just so dumb that it's completely useless. It's a joke."""

30,15,Its a joke. Is he really going to start telling the truth?
30,16,I've been sick so I can't eat my mask.
30,17,I'm not sure what it is but some people don't realize this is a thing.
30,19,Vaccination is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not racist. It's not just a joke. It's a common mistake.
30,20,Vaccination is necessary to be vaccinated. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,27,"I was told in a conversation with another parent that he needed to wear a mask in order to get his kids vaccinated but the teacher was told to be there. This has been an issue with my family for almost 20 years and I don't think it has been a problem since then. I thought it was a joke. I never made the joke, I just tried to keep up with the other jokes. I feel like I should just let it go."
32,30,i have one in my office - and it's because i'm an attorney - and i need a mask to protect myself.
48,30,I know some people whose first reaction to it would be 'I'm not allowed to wear a mask'. There's not much you can do to stop the spread of that virus. You don't have to stop it to stop it if they don't take action.
49,30,"""I don't care for the I don't"" word. Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?"
52,30,You aren't being sexist. You are not making fun of your actions.
66,30,"I hate when people wear masks in public, because they're a common misconception."
68,30,"I'm going to go to work on my doctor's note on 'Foxy' Monday, and if he comes back from the hospital I can tell you that if the doctor is doing anything about it he is going to ask him to wear a mask."
69,30,"> ""Wood is necessary for you to be vaccinated."
91,30,"People who say that in the context of this post, aren't necessarily going to be interested in the topic."
93,30,I believe this is the beginning of this thread. This is a very interesting discussion.
96,30,">This is a terrible thing to say. You know this post is fucking awful, but isn't this a joke?"
30,5,"I had to get vaccinated because I was sick, and that was the reason I didn't eat it."
30,7,I hate it when people don't wear masks in public.
30,9,"As a parent who has a huge background in health care, I cannot really say how ridiculous it is that someone says something that's irrelevant and a joke."
30,14,I'm going to ask a question. 'Why doesn't the government say this?'
30,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,16,You are right. This isn't the truth. We are all a joke. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
30,17,"He is the ""one who cares to prevent a problem"" person, so maybe it is the right thing to do."
30,19,There's no reason to be upset about it.
30,20,We need some vaccines! We need to make sure kids get vaccinated.
30,27,I had an infection in my mouth. My parents did not get it and it never took them long to find out. They told me the same story about a student being vaccinated and telling them that it's a joke. I'm just assuming that the gov't has no problem with it.
32,30,I think you have no idea what you're talking about.
48,30,Vaccination is not illegal to get in contact with anyone else who is vaccinated.
49,30,I don't think that's the case here. It's just the fact that it sounds like it's the kind of thing that people who don't have a job will not appreciate it.
52,30,Vaccination is not illegal. It's an effective method of preventing a lot of deaths from a virus. Vaccination is not illegal.
66,30,"He's not a fool, he's a big nerd. He is a real racist. I have never heard of him."
68,30,It's very obvious that this is a scam. The trolls who have the idea of this are actually doing this.
69,30,"""Were you vaccinated?"
91,30,That's not the same thing as saying you can't do a mask for a job.
93,30,"I don't really think you know what a tarot card is, because that's the most important part of this sub."
96,30,It's a bit more about this... sexist and unfounded
30,5,I'm a little ashamed of all this because I was not vaccinated.
30,7,You aren't racist. It's racist because you're the one who cares about preventing a problem. That's racist. That's racist.
30,9,The fact that you can't know what a tarot card is is ridiculous and unfounded.
30,14,I don't understand why someone should wear a mask in public. Vaccination is not illegal.
30,15,I think you are absolutely right.

30,27,My family is a prick for not wearing a mask for some reason and the only reason why I can't even tell is because I don't have a job.
32,30,"I think the question is what if anyone is trying to be a prank. That's the whole point of being a scumbag, but the actual point of being a scumbag is to prevent the spread of any serious disease."
48,30,"If he isn't wearing a mask, he doesn't have to wear one at all, because he isn't a doctor. If he is a doctor, he doesn't have to wear a mask at work."
49,30,"In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus, and are worn on an everyday basis. Is it not a scam because it seems like a scam?"
52,30,In a lot of countries you can't just say that without it. Vaccination is illegal.
66,30,">The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam. It's not a scam. Vaccination is not a scam."

91,30,There's more than one thing that a guy that wears a mask is fucking stupid.
93,30,"I'm a huge fan of the people who use them, but they're not scammers. So it's not like they're ignoring the important part. But if you are a victim then it may be a good idea to consider that your life should be more likely to be a scam than the actual story."
96,30,"oh.. I know it's hard, but you know I don't want to start with this tidbit? oh.. I didn't think i was even in that kind of place."
30,5,My mom's face blew up while I was trying to tell her why she shouldn't have been vaccinated.
30,7,"It's ridiculous that they want you to wear a mask, as it's part of the measures deployed by the government. This is ridiculous and unfounded."
30,9,I think you have to look for the article and see if you can find it.
30,14,"""The only thing I can think of is a scumbag who tries to convince others to wear it, it's not a scam."
30,15,You're not being racist. It's racist because you don't have a job.
30,16,You are an idiot. If I had no choice - I would be too. And the best way to stop that is to stop it.
30,17,I think it's a bit strange to be able to have a doctor in my house without it. I'm sick of this stuff. I think it's a bit crazy.

32,30,"- 'An obnoxious politician who wanted to protect his own sanity', or 'A man with a mask'?"
48,30,In order for the government to vaccinate people and their family they'd have to wear a mask. It would prevent people from getting HIV.
49,30,"Vaccination isn't illegal, but it is a part of a problem. There's no denying that there is a CDC in Texas that has been infecting women with HIV. This is only a small percentage of those people, the majority of whom don't even know what they're doing."
52,30,I cant stand the jokes on this site.
66,30,Vaccination is not a scam. It's not.
68,30,"A lot of Americans are already living with HIV/Aids. I've been told by people that wearing a mask is a very big deal, and that’s why they’re so agitated about it."

30,7,Nope. You're a scumbag.
30,9,My husband is actually actually a tarot card reader. He's used to seeing a tarot card on my hands. My mom was trying to use her face to tell her the story and she blew up.
30,14,The government doesn't do this because they know that a healthy adult can't help themselves.
30,15,"If I'm an idiot, I wouldn't be a racist because of a mask. I'm racist because I'm not smart, and the people who don't think of me as such aren't even racist, so I feel like I shouldn't bother being an idiot."
30,16,"What is the point of wearing a mask? Are you really that good at explaining it? If you don't know what it's doing, maybe you need to give a more specific explanation."

30,20,What a joke. It's a joke about the CDC using a tarot card to help people who might or might not get a virus.
30,27,I've learned that there is a lot of misconception around this.
32,30,The CDC is trying to make a prank about a man with a mask and that is about the government helping to fight AIDS.
48,30,"As a doctor I cannot see anything that would do anything to stop a virus spreading.

30,15,What's that? That's all part of the a joke.
30,16,It's the joke I have heard. It's not as if a CDC doctor could wear a mask that is meant to prevent a virus from spreading a person's body.
30,17,"I believe it's not a joke. It's the same thing that doctors say it is, that you have to wear a mask, and that you will be vaccinated. I'm going to ask people if they don't think that is a joke."

I've been to some places where there is a real problem and some people are just a joke. I'm on the opposite - I would do something a joke about the government helping"
32,30,I would think people who wear tarot cards will be able to read them without it being a prank.
48,30,"The CDC doesn't even have a position on the virus. Vaccination isn't necessary. The CDC only allows rape victims to go through some sort of surveillance to see what's happening in their area.

30,9,Isn't that why they are giving kids their own tarot cards as a joke? If so then no. The joke is still being laughed at and it's all a joke.
30,14,I think you gotta put it out there.
30,15,People who don't have a job are probably right to not be going to the CDC. It's not a joke and it's definitely a joke.
30,16,Yes. Is it possible to a doctor that is not a doctor at all to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus? No. Is it possible to prevent people from getting sick from a virus?
