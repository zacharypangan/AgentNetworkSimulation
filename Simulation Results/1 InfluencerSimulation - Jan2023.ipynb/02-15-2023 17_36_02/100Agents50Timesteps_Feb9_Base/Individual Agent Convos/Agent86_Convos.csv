91,86,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
95,86,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
86,8,"They're stupid. I'm not even sure if the rest is just because they think they're stupid. I'm in college and I like to wear a mask to sleep. When I'm sitting in a seat in a cafeteria, I put on a mask. I'll leave my chair on because it sucks."
86,11,This is actually a valid concern in a lot of states. I don't want to see this as a violation of the federal government's regulations about how to handle public safety.
86,25,"I work in an office and would try to do this, but that doesn't make me a bad coach. I've done this to players."

86,84,I'm sure you've had a few conversations on this. Basically I don't understand why a mask is so useless. It's like when a doctor takes a patient to a doctor and says it's impossible to smoke in your own bed when the doctor is trying to tell you they've done this before.
91,86,I think you are missing the point oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
95,86,"I'm sorry but I think this is just my personal opinion. The fact that I was the only one who did this to me is actually pretty interesting. I would definitely never wear a mask at all. If you haven't seen it before it may have been a symptom of a virus causing you to have to play, and if you are, I would say that wearing a mask isn't a good idea because that's something that many players want to avoid."
86,8,"So, I'm really glad that this isn't true."
86,11,"This is where it is on the wiki page, where people are trying to talk about how many people should not wear masks."

86,73,"I don't know, but I can tell you what this is:"
86,76,"So this explains why the government is allowing a narcotic to spread in the form of smoke. It's a myth, and I'm not sure it's true."
86,79,That's the point of a mask. This is not a one-off thing. This is a common mistake and it should not be the only thing that you can do to get rid of that nonsense.

86,11,"You're right, the government's regulations are naive. They don't really apply. What you're describing is a huge apathy against narcotics. The way they're deployed in the US is to allow for that a certain amount of narcotics spread from a certain place - from a small part of the throat to the eyes.

86,73,What a shitty remark...
86,76,The people who do this really aren't the ones who are getting fucked.
86,79,"You're not stupid enough to understand what they mean. But if you don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking."
86,84,"In addition to the many stupid things the government does for your health, it can also be a way to prevent you from becoming an asshole like my parents. The government can not be responsible for you if your helmet does not fit you."
91,86,I can't imagine how I would do that. The people who think you are in the minority are the ones that think that you can't be a good person without a mask.
95,86,"You can go see the movie, The Man Who Got The Virus. It's on Netflix."
86,8,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,11,So you're suggesting that putting on a mask for sleep is a thing in a way which is naive. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,25,"I can see why the government is allowing a virus to spread from a small part of the throat to the eyes. Basically, this mask is a medical treatment based on a pre-existing condition. Whether or not it's actually a cure for this is another story."
86,73,"...and that I can only speak for a few days at a time, because I'm not gonna say I'd rather do the best I can for my health without a mask. I am not sure what a shitty remark it was, but I could tell you what was meant. if you don't understand what they meant it's pretty messed up..."
86,76,Apparently the person doing this was the CDC that made the statement. The CDC would've been right to do it in an emergency if the person didn't put on a mask.
86,79,"It's the fucking government. If it doesn't work well and they're making a statement about that, I'm sure they'll agree and say something like ""You don't understand what they mean, but if they don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking."
86,84,The wiki page is just a great place to get a sense of what the people do to a mask.
91,86,"He's not saying the government is responsible for trying to stop the spread of a virus, he's saying that that is an understatement."
95,86,He said something about being the only person who smothered a virus in his life.
86,8,"This whole whole whole thing is a joke. I'm not even sure if this is the truth, but they are absolutely fucking ignorant."
86,11,>He's saying something about being the only person who smothered a virus in his life
86,25,"I can see why the government is allowing this to happen in a medical facility and how it will actually make you a good person, and that is one of the dumbest things I've ever done."
86,73,"I'm not sure if you're serious but this doesn't seem like a really bad thing. I was wondering how it was possible to go from 1 to 0 without a mask. If only, if the mask wasn't in the right place."
86,76,This is so ridiculous that it ruined my job for about three weeks in college. I still have to wear a mask.
86,79,""" I'm not stupid enough to understand what they mean. But if they don't understand what they mean, then yes they are stupid enough to understand their way of thinking."""
86,84,"If you wear a mask for sleep, you have to show an instructor what it means."

86,8,"The whole thing is a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
86,11,"That's kind of an understatement, I thought that was all part of the explanation."
86,25,"The mask is really the real thing, and when they use it, you can't change it, especially not when you're still in the office. And your body's ability to recognize it is insufficient, and your ability to get it out is insufficient."
86,73,This guy seems like a scumbag who does not want to put on a mask. He's just a jerk who will go crazy if he can't change a mask.
86,76,"I think the reason they are allowing this to happen is because it is so ridiculous, but I can see why people would not do it."
86,79,"I mean this is one of those things where you literally need to wear a mask to take advantage of a virus before you start thinking about it. That's not really how you would do a job, that's why you need a mask, that's why a man who smothered a virus in his life needs to go to a doctor first, and then after awhile the doctor can say what he means to you when he tries to go to a psychiatric clinic, etc. The thing he can't do is a doctor"
86,84,"The government was wrong. I'm not sure that's true, but they are completely stupid. I think they're fucking dumb."
91,86,There's more than one thing that a guy that wears a mask is fucking stupid. He can't be a good person without a mask. This is just not an easy idea.
95,86,This makes me sick to hear.
86,8,"It's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
86,11,"So, you know how to deal with someone in the medical field, right? I don't know. But it's a huge difference between not doing something and actually doing something. You're just going to feel a bit like you're doing something wrong. This isn't something that you can be happy with and I'd probably try it. But, that's not how you think it should be. So you're going to be miserable if you don't do it."
86,25,"I think this is what he was trying to do, but apparently he was simply trying to smother his teammates by using the mask as a way of protecting himself from the virus"
86,73,... and that I'm not gonna say I'd rather do the best I can for my health without a mask.

86,84,A guy has been a terrible prick all his life.
91,86,This is the most garbage comment I've ever read. OP has a very bad amputation of the brain. It's the best thing in the world to learn and have a better one than the most stupid one.
95,86,"What do you mean by ""This makes me sick to hear""? ""As a kid I used to play hockey, I like wearing masks, so I just keep trying to be better. I love hockey, and I know how it's not a problem if I'm not wearing one. I'd have to change it. I'm not sure I want to. It's just a joke."

86,25,"I think the joke would be “that this man just wears a mask to smother his teammates and keep trying to be better.” Or “Hey, it’s actually not a joke” because “he was trying to help to keep a person healthy and healthy.”"
86,73,"OP: ""I am not sure what a shitty remark...', ""...and that I'm not gonna say I'd rather do the best I can for my health without a mask. I am not sure what a shitty remark it was, but I could tell you what was meant."" Is this really a joke?"
86,76,"They don't believe the government is allowing this. If they are allowing this, then they are allowing it to happen."
86,79,"I'm in the process of going through this myself, and if they don't work for me, they will not give me a full explanation of what smothering is."
86,84,You're not trying to be funny. You're trying to be serious.
91,86,The people that think you are in the minority are the ones that think you can't be a good person without a mask.

95,86,/r/legaladvice will be re-reading the full report if you want to get the complete picture.
86,8,"The word ""jam"" doesn't even get thrown out. They are not funny because they are not going to make a joke. It gets thrown out because they are putting a shit in your face and trying to get people in the game. It's just that the joke doesn't get to be in a real way."
86,11,>He's saying something about being the only person who smothered a virus in his life
86,25,"This is not just a joke. This is a joke. It's like how people will have a bad time saying something ""I am not sure what a joke is"", ""I am not sure what a joke is."""

86,79,"It's not funny, its a joke."
86,84,What are you talking about. The government is a bit of a jerk. This is what the government does.

86,11,Is a mask not a joke?
86,25,"There's an article in the article stating that the use of a mask is based on a condition, and that it is a type of treatment for the flu."
86,73,"In this thread, I see a post about ""Secret Advice,"" in which one of the guys is ""I would rather go to the doctor"" instead of blaming his wife for having a hard time breathing."
86,76,"I don't know how many people I know who are getting in the virus fucking up and they are saying this. It's not a joke. The government is a jerk. This is what the government does. If the government isn't going to work for you, they are allowing it."
86,79,OP is the one who is going to get infected by a virus.
86,84,I think the government is just trying to get more people to understand what's going on.
91,86,"I don't think the wiki article is being particularly interesting, but that is just because the people here are not that familiar with it."
95,86,"I've played on the Hockey team in the NHL for 8 years and have never seen a team wearing a mask. I'm not sure why they would let a team not wear it for the entire game and they would let a team wear it for the whole game. Then you'd see the game in person, see what happens, he's an assistant whose job it is to keep the players on the field."
86,8,I don't understand why he's asking for jokes and saying that he won't be doing them or even trying to bring them up but the fact that the government is trying to make a joke for the sake of a good person.
86,11,It's not a joke - it's a joke. It's a joke. The government is a jerk. They're just trying to push people in.
86,25,It's the right answer for you.
