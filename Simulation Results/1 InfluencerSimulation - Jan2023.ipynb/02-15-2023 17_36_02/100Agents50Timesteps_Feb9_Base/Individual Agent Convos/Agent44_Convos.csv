44,18,You’re absolutely right. I do not believe in the use of a mask or masking. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,29,This makes me wonder how much of a problem football and the like have in common as a result of people not wearing masks.

65,44,"Ingraham did not mention that wearing a mask was necessary to stop a virus from spreading. You are completely correct, but I think the whole point is, I know you're being wrong, but you're completely right."
69,44,A guy with boosters goes to TWitchcon without a mask. He got vaccinated. So the mask is off-duty. He does not have boosters.
83,44,"What I mean is that I am in the hvac community and i am going to be an attunement on these issues, if you've got a mask you can go to a theater with the vaccinated person, and then use it to go to the party with me, and you can't really go anywhere with the vaccinated person. Unless you have a health insurance it is absolutely not appropriate to wear a mask, or to have a health insurance that you can wear while you're vaccinated, not for vaccinated"

46,44,"We can say things like this as a company or an individual, but I think it makes me sick. I can't stand being a person wearing a mask in public, and the fact that I am in a position to tell someone who's a horrible person who isn't in charge of my life and not a politician is just so sad that people are scared of people doing bad things in public."
53,44,"I'm pretty sure there are no signs that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government. I mean, it's still the rule. But what makes this a problem? I'm not sure what it means. I have no idea how many people have said this."
65,44,Vaccination - not to mention the fact that it isn't in your docs.
69,44,"As a public health professional, I was told that I had to wear a mask to help protect my health."
83,44,"Yes, it's not an issue of ""wearing a mask."" It's not something that's enforced by the government. This is why we have all the laws we have in place to prevent that."
44,18,It makes me wonder how much of a problem football and the like have in common as a result of people not wearing masks.
44,29,I feel like I have to say something to the effect of I want to wear my mask when he's in the hospital. What I would do is not say it to him in public.
44,38,What is the definition of a mask?
44,42,I don't even know how that came to be. I didn't really look it up but the X-ray machine would help me see how thick the mask can get and makes the masks look like the old ones
46,44,There's so much that can be done to stop the spread of a virus. The government isn't doing the right thing. They aren't trying to do the right thing.
53,44,"I'm going to ask a guy how he came to the conclusion that he doesn't care for the ""I don't"" word. Is that how the US Government has been treating the US this way?"
65,44,"In the past when the health insurance companies had a ""free"" policy for a certain kind of product, they'd always say ""funny stuff."" I've gotten a lot of this in the past when my gf was in a really messed up situation. I wore a mask every day. My gf was wearing a mask everyday for several years but I'm still scared of getting sick because I couldn't breathe, I was afraid of getting in to someone I didn't want to leave with."
69,44,"As a public health professional, I was told that I had to wear a mask to help protect my health."
83,44,I know. It makes you wonder why we don't use them in public. You are right that the CDC doesn't have mandates. It doesn't make sense for people to wear a mask in public when you are in public. You don't even know the problem.
44,18,"I don't even know why people wear masks in public, but to me the fact that it can make me sick makes me sad."
44,29,i think there is a lot of good news. a lot of people in hvac are saying it as a way to help with the issue
44,38,"This is not a new thing, but it is a way of looking at it."

65,44,I'd be so ashamed of my mask to be able to go to a hospital and have a doctor ask me if I have a mask and I go to work.
69,44,"Yes, a mask is a mandate. If you're a doctor, you have to wear it."
83,44,">Also, there are dozens of groups that I think are in favor of a mask."
44,18,You know what's funny? The CDC didn't have mandates. It's a big red flag.
44,29,I think the thing is the problem is that people don't actually wear masks or are wearing them at all. I'm more concerned with protecting my body from other people who may see it.
44,38,The people who grew up in the US who grew up in countries with masks are the most ill people. We have to wear them and not be forced into it.
44,42,"It's really hard to believe that this is a thing we can do to stop this from happening, given that this isn't a problem. It's about how people who aren't healthy in a health care system, get sick. That's something we need to be concerned about."

65,44,I have to ask my gf to have a doctor ask her how she's doing. And if it doesn't help with her health.
69,44,You said it was mandatory to wear a mask to protect yourself.
83,44,"I don't think the CDC actually has mandates because it isn't in place for everyone to have to wear a mask. They aren't trying to make the public do that. They are trying to make it so that no one gets an infection, and that's a red flag."
44,18,It's called a 'big red flag'.
44,29,"No one in hvac would believe that people are wearing a mask. No one in hvac would ever see anyone wearing it and the only thing they would be able to see is the NSA, which is a conspiracy nut."
44,38,"If the US government doesn't want to help, then I don't see a problem with them. There is a problem because of the CDC and the public health profession. You can see the problem, the problem is the government has to help."
44,42,It doesn't make sense to wear a mask if you're going to a health care facility. The other person's concern is that the mask is actually necessary to prevent infections or to prevent infected people from getting sick.
46,44,>It seems like they’re a lot more than just covering up fake news stories.
53,44,That is exactly the kind of thing that a lot of people don't understand. That's a great question. I'd like to get a little help. I'm in a vaccinated state but the government has the same issue. I'm in a vaccinated state but the government has the same issue.

It sounds like the reason Trump has been ad-free about it is because they're a good health system. Why not have your doctor check your masks or something?

83,44,My friends and I are all in favor of wearing masks.
44,18,This is a common thing for the people who are a member of the CDC. People that have been in the CDC's department of health are not a member. There are other things they should be doing.
44,29,Vaccination is a big deal. People need a mask if they want to stop an outbreak or to fight it.
44,38,"Because, while the CDC is working on keeping people safe and safe, the problem is that they are being inept. In the US, they can only get better, and a big hooded mask will only make the problem worse."
44,42,"The masks are just a way to show to doctors that if they don't want to wear them, the disease will likely not spread. The government should not be able to provide an actual vaccine, which would cause that issue. I don't see why it's hard to believe that wearing a mask is necessary. They've already proven that it is necessary."

83,44,You guys seem like a bunch of 'obvious idiots' that just wanted to make fun of it.
44,18,We are now surrounded by a large population of people who are not going to be able to get sick if they aren't on a mask. We have no idea what we are doing here and aren't being able to continue educating our people a bit. We are just going to have to put up with the CDC because we haven't been able to get enough information and it's a big deal.
44,29,"CDC has been in place for some time. So maybe you're not aware of it, but this is also one of the issues with the CDC and its staff. So, yes, I think there's a lot of good news."
44,38,"Yes, it's a big deal. The people who have masks and go out to see a doctor are the ones who want to help. The people who are the best at protecting the population are those who are the worst at having them."

83,44,Vaccination of hvac patients is one of the measures to prevent that spread.
44,18,If you really don't want to get vaccinated you should get it. A lot of people have different concerns about getting vaccines.
44,29,This has been discussed and discussed in a lot of different ways. Among them: Vaccination is a big deal. People need to wear them if they want to stop the spread of a virus.

53,44,Vaccination isn't just a safety issue. There is no such thing as a “vaccination” in the US.
65,44,The fact that the CDC's mask doesn't count as a joke doesn't mean they need to go against all of their mandates.
69,44,I think this is the only one I'm interested in.
83,44,"It's hard to believe that we're talking about the government, and that the mask in question doesn't apply to anything outside of AIDS and its vaccinations. There's a lot more to it than the other ones."

44,18,I think it's a joke that people are making fun of.
44,29,"The joke is actually a joke, but the fact is, if you don't actually wear a mask or are sick to the point of wearing a mask, you're essentially saying, ""What if you wear a mask?

44,38,I was just talking to a person I knew on social media about this issue. I was really intrigued by the article and was enlightened to find the CDC is an anti-viral drug....but I was surprised to find the CDC not only allows people to have HIV vaccines but also that it prevents cancer. I have no idea how to find that information - there are a lot of doctors that could provide HIV vaccines at their disposal. I mean a lot of people that could not get vaccines are still at risk of it.
44,42,"Then you're just asking ""I don't want you to get sick or die or be in a position to help someone who doesn't have a phobia of people."" This is the kind of joke that's a bit of a dick joke."

44,29,This is really good. I'll take my time and get a real laugh out of it.
44,38,I think that this is a joke that is not relevant.

69,44,Why does this not be a joke?
83,44,It’s a joke because a health care worker said that this was necessary because the CDC is sabotage the public’s health by sabotage people’s health – so they've told them that it is a joke.
44,18,There's a reason to have them.
44,29,"I don't know where the ""Joke"" is. ""I don't know how people are asking a joke if a joke is a joke."""

44,42,I’m still a troll.
46,44,CANNOTANSWER. I'd say a hat and a hat are two different things. It's not a joke. It's a joke because people have a phobia of people. They are just trying to make people act stupid. It's a joke.
53,44,"I don't get what you mean, but I think you mean that the CDC is trying to convince the CDC that vaccination isn't the answer to the AIDS epidemic. This is not about a prank and it's about the CDC being a joke."
65,44,"I think the premise is that it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The premise is that the government can't make the government do what they want. 'The only way it's funny is to make people laugh. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
69,44,Then you've gotta be mad and have a real discussion with me on what's funny.
83,44,"I'm not sure if this is any more appropriate than I thought it was, but it's worth noting the amount of BS and BS people make out about the CDC's mandates."
44,18,"I think it's hilarious that you've got to be a bit introspective. 'The CDC is a dick. It's not a joke. It's a joke because you know how much people think vaccination is a joke, but you know how it's a joke because you've got a bad ear.'"

53,44,"And if you get it a few days later, he is going to try to convince him to stop and reevaluate it."
65,44,"He was trying to make a point, but he was trying to imply that a mask was needed to stop the spread of the virus, and that a medical procedure is needed to stop that."
69,44,"I feel like I have lost this joke to a [NAME] because it was just made up. I'd rather be mad, than sarcastic."
83,44,"I'm a woman, and I'm afraid I've been called a joke, because my husband is a narcissist and he didn't understand that his joke was a joke."
44,18,I think if they want the CDC to have mandates it should get rid of them. I have a pretty bad feeling about my friends being raped. I like to joke around with people who don't understand why they don't want to have a mandate for them to do something that will be necessary to stop a shit-do you mean joke.

53,44,It's a joke because the government wants to save people's lives. It's a joke. It's a joke because the government wants to take the real solution and make things right.
65,44,The thing is the masks are pretty cheap and the cost isn't that low. They're a lot of funnier than the actual things on show.
69,44,"So the only reason he's mad is that his reaction to it is so a joke is not funny, they're just jokes?"
83,44,There are two main problems: 1) It’s an inadequacy of CDC’s mandates; 2) It sucks because the CDC didn’t know that vaccinating people would be a real problem.
