58,24,So it was a joke. If you are joking then what's the point?
64,24,Getting AIDS to spread and then having to wear a mask doesn't really sound like a joke. I don't think the title is that great.

24,6,Ingraham is a medical student. She is a lawyer. He isn't a doctor.
24,15,It sounds to me like it's a joke that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. That's not a joke. Is this really a joke? Those people sound very stupid.
24,19,"In my opinion, wearing a mask is one of the simplest and most useful ways to protect yourself from infection. It's actually one of the most effective measures available to combat HIV infection. Whenever I'm talking about it, I get the whole “I do not wear a mask” mentality of being a doctor (you know I need one to be a doctor) and then I don't have to go to a doctor's office to protect myself from HIV, but as a doctor it really doesn't matter how people are treating me."

70,24,"A lot of people do this, and we're all pretty good with them."
79,24,"I think the title is misleading. I don't know who the author is, but the headline in this post sounds quite offensive. I think the joke isn't funny. 'I don't think we should be having a joke here. It's just that I’m going to have to be a doctor for a few years to get around to wearing a mask, because that’s not a joke."

99,24,It sounds like a bunch of people have lost a mask. A lot.
100,24,It's probably also a joke because AIDS is a real virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's real.
24,3,What the fuck do people do to keep the government obligated to protect people from AIDS?
24,6,'Twitchcon' is kind of a joke. The card is a joke because it's the tarot card.
24,15,A lot of tarot card stories are actually from Canada.
24,19,"I think the ""joke"" is more that a joke in the sense that you don't want to hear it. It's more about you not knowing about it and knowing it's a joke and not about how you think you need to wear it."
24,20,It doesn’t seem funny to me. It’s a joke. It’s a joke because it doesn’t affect the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because it’s real.

58,24,"As one of the two authors of the book ""The Man Who Got the Virus"" said in a podcast that the CDC is trying to keep people safe, it's a serious health concern. It's a serious health concern. The CDC is not trying to make it a joke, it's just a joke."

70,24,"he's going to go to the doctor's office and make a joke about the cdc. It's a prank because he's the cdc's agent. This is just a joke, because it's a joke that's part of the cdc's policy."

24,6,I think 'twitchcon' is more a joke because it's not the best one. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a real joke. They're trying to get money back from the U.S. government.
