87,23,Exactly! So why doesn't Ms. Ingraham be out with them? She's out there with them.
87,24,I've seen a bunch of fake news stories that I had to watch for.
87,27,I know a lot of people who like to take their masks off. I can get to work on a laptop or a PC at work and see if I can get one at work without a mask on.

87,52,Is the whole thing fake? They are so sexist that I don't know if they believe anything.
87,55,"I mean, that would be a lot of the problems that are common in our society today. It's not like someone who is stupid is actually a person who knows this and has the right to tell others, but just because you know the facts doesn't mean they're not innocent."

87,73,This is so... stupid that I want to be mad at the people who are taking my money.

87,23,It's a good idea to get a real one to help you if you want to. Having a few people help you would make you more and more dependent on that one.

87,55,The whole government has some nonsense to do with the government rescinding the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
87,58,I'm so frustrated with the people who believe it's a good idea to go to the doctor and get a full blown HIV shot? I'm too tired of talking about them.
87,61,"So you're gonna tell me that they were trying to force us to stop this? You're going to say, ""Hello, do you know how this happened"" and then rephrase it to ""Hey, do you know how this happened? We need to stop this,"" but then they won't let us stop it."
87,62,>We rescinded the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
87,64,It's a terrible way to tell a lot of people.

87,70,What are you referring to? This is not a good idea to make an appointment to go through all the paperwork and documenting the events.
87,71,I know this isn't very likely to happen in our country.
87,73,It's all a scam.
87,77,"In a way, that's a bit of a descriptor."
87,81,"The most recent news reports that show that a group of people died of cancer are from infected people being taken by the government, which in theory is a very big part of the problem of government propaganda."
87,84,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Are you a Republican? What is in you a Republican? Exactly! So why doesn't Ms. Ingraham be out there with them."""
99,87,Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus is the simplest thing to do.
87,2,"This is the only reason you have to be in a government with the right to do nothing. You're right, if you don't want to go to the doctor because you don't want to risk getting into the ER, you might as well do it yourself. This is one of those things where you have to be in a hospital to take care of people."
87,3,"This whole thing is sexist, so it's an obvious scam. Apparently the masks used aren't part of the laws rescinded by the government."
87,8,"The problem is that you need to talk to your state congressperson who voted to enact the government's ""mask protection"" legislation. There's a reason it's so hard to get people to take the health care legislation that's actually a good idea."
87,16,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In fact, in a nutshell, she's not a republican. This is in fact a Republican issue. It's a good idea to get a real one to help you if you want to."
87,19,"I know it's a joke, but this is a genuine example of how the US Government doesn't understand how it works."
87,23,I stayed here for six months and came across this one one day.
87,24,"Well, a little late in the thread. The trolls, and all the people who think that a troll can be a bad guy. I'm just going to get downvoted for trying to explain that. The most important thing to me is that they don't talk about 'I'm a Republican, a republican' and then continue to argue that it's a fraud."
87,27,"Generally the people are able to tell a lot of people and if they don't, that's not a bad idea. Unless you're in a position to speak with a politician about HIV/AIDS, it's a bad idea."
87,32,"I'm not sure why they're calling it a scam, they just haven't come up with something about a virus yet and have to make it up to their own people."
87,37,This sounds like it's kind of old. If there were people in your country that was a threat that would be more easily spread than the repercussions of them dying in a health emergency.
87,52,It's a good thing that the government won't even take an AIDS test if she doesn't know the law.
87,55,"I think they's just trying to stop the virus, but the government is not doing anything about it."
87,58,"So I say to you, ""We rescinded the decision to not wear the fabled mask as a condition of protection against a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it."
87,61,"So you're saying that I'm a Republican, and you're not an American. That means I'm not even American."

87,70,So what I would like you to do for an entire week is to go and get a full blown HIV shot?
87,71,"It's not a legitimate way to tell them how to stop it, but the idea of making it a threat has always been about making them aware of the threat and it's only the threat that will bother them and push them to do the right thing."
87,73,"I can't get to the doctor without a mask on, so I guess it's time to call the police?"
87,77,"I'm an American citizen. So why don't you get a face mask? Clearly you've got a bunch of facts to prove that I'm wrong, but it seems like the whole government has a legitimate issue with this."
87,81,"It's not about the mask, it's about the ability of people to tell others, and then if you don't, it's a little over their head to call you."
87,84,"I would like to point out that she had the same issues as Trump in her post. The fact that a virus has spread has made her a bad politician and she was a hypocrite and they're gonna take a hit on it again. They're going to be invading our country a lot, and they're not going to stop this."
99,87,Getting a mask is a scam.
87,2,The President's a hypocrite and it doesn't matter what he says. He's a real president.
87,3,I'd like to point out that the whole government has a legitimate issue with this.
87,8,Why do you think the people in question have been in a position to talk to someone about the health care legislation?
87,16,"I hate that this is a joke, but in the end I don't feel like it's relevant anymore."
87,19,"Obama said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"
87,23,">I'm not sure why they're calling it a scam, they just haven't come up with something about a virus yet and have to make it up to their own people."
87,24,"""The fact that a virus has spread has made her a bad politician and she was a hypocrite and they're gonna take a hit on it again."
87,27,"The truth is that a mask is really important. If you think it's a bad idea and you have an AIDS vaccine, you're in the right."
87,32,"As an American, I can see what you're saying. The government is the one that made this a joke, but he is not a troll. He is trying to hide that he is a troll."
87,37,"If you're not a Democrat, you could easily have an issue with the US government giving you a mask that doesn't have a mandate or protection in place."
87,52,Is there any way to know whether someone is going to go to the doctor?
87,55,"...because then, on top of that, the US Government will shit on a Republican candidate. And it's the Republican side that won't get involved. It's the country that isn't on their side."
87,58,"I'm gonna try to write you an update, please."
87,61,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus; they're not going to be doing anything about it.
87,62,I would want to tell people. That's the most insulting and derogatory thing to say.
87,64,I'm going to go ahead and put it like this.
87,68,It seems like the government has the same issue with this.
87,70,"I thought it was actually a joke, but I also thought that it's really about the mask. So why not get a full blown HIV shot? I really want to see if there are any signs of HIV on the news or in the streets."
87,71,This was done a long time ago by the US government.
87,73,"AIDS is like a virus that can kill any and everyone. I think you know that if the government has a legitimate problem with this it will be for you to find one, but it's not like they're doing it for other countries."
87,77,"Ingraham, as mentioned in the article, is a very good man. Having a face mask is really the first thing she will do."
87,81,You can have the AIDS mask.
87,84,Yes. This is a good point. This is a really good point.
99,87,"As a Canadian, this is a really big problem. The government needs to take steps to stop the spread of a virus."
87,2,"""What do you want to see at a doctor? This is one of those things where you have to be in a hospital to take care of people."""
87,3,"It's also the biggest fraud of any political campaign, if that's what you're going to call it."
87,8,Are they not the victims of HIV?
87,16,"The article is a lot of jokes, but there's nothing wrong with the joke being one."
87,19,That's how we are gonna get people sick. I can't say how far away we've been but I would want to see the health of the country. I've seen an article on that website that says that the government has a legitimate problem with this.
87,23,"The government is the one that made this a joke, but he is not a troll. He is trying to hide that he is a troll."
87,24,"He is actually a real anti-Wisconsin supporter of a virus, not a Democrat, but a Republican."

87,37,"In the US, there's a lot more than that."
87,52,The US government wants to use people like Obama to stop the spread of the disease. They don't want to do that.
87,55,"I don't see why it's a joke. I'm going to try to write you an update, please."
87,58,"Considering that the government is trying to kill a few people, this would make a lot of sense."
87,61,"The only person who can say it isn't true is an actual government official. The AIDS government has said that they are going to take steps to stop the spread of the virus, and that a mask isn't going to stop that."
87,62,He has no right to claim he is a troll for not being a legitimate politician.
87,64,I think this is a good point.
87,68,I think they have to pay attention to the context of the article in case there's any real difference. It's not like they're allowing the government to control what people are doing.
87,70,"I want to get a mask for a day or two because my job is not getting any money. I will get the full blown HIV shot, as well as a face mask for a month if I go to the doctor."
87,71,I see a problem with wearing a mask for that reason. It's just a disguise for an HIV epidemic.
87,73,"It was a big one and was a really big one for me, and I would tell every other Canadian who volunteered."
87,77,There is a bit of a fetish in the American media.
87,81,Ingraham and Obama have talked in this subreddit about how their masks have become a'shock attack'.
87,84,It’s just a big deal. A mask isn’t the only thing to help the disease. A government must take steps to stop the disease.

87,32,I don't care if you wear a mask to keep someone sick if you don't want to. You don't want to do it.
87,37,AIDS is a cult of the tarot. AIDS has become a religious race.
87,52,The AIDS government is trying to stop the spread of the disease. They don't want to do that. I think this is a good point. The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official.
87,55,Why are you so close to AIDS?
87,58,"As a Canadian whose job isn't getting any money, and if I go to the doctor, I'm not even sure I have enough money to support a family member that could get an HIV shot. I can't believe I didn't get a vaccine and I'm very confused."
87,61,I feel the masks are a big deal for the US to use to help the spread of HIV.
87,62,> He has no right to claim he is a troll for not being a legitimate politician.
87,64,That's a bit of a joke.
87,68,"A lot of Americans are already living with HIV/Aids. I’ve been told by people that wearing a mask is a very big deal, and that’s why they’re so agitated about it. The government is trying to use some crazy people to make it seem like the virus is only in the hands of those who are in control of what it does. And there’s the obvious possibility that they may have the idea that Obama is not in control of the country and that the US is trying to stop the disease."

I'm scared that I'm going to have a bad time with it."

87,16,"So, I'm going to give the fucking truth. That doesn't sound very credible. If the government has anything to worry about, the first step will be to take the fight to a more serious level than the one they've been doing. It will be time to make a real choice. The government has also shown that that's not the way to go if it's a really good idea."
87,19,"The truth is, it is not going to be in an article written by someone who has to be honest with you - it will not be in the news or the news."

87,32,if you do not care if you wear a mask and the doctor tells you you don't care if it is a tarot card or a fake tarot card then you don't care what you tell your doctor.
87,37,"Having a tarot card doesn't count, especially not for a friend of mine. AIDS is just a fetish and I'm just curious, as to what makes this a good thing?"

87,61,I think there are a lot of people out there who are worried about HIV/AIDS.
87,62,It was a joke. You just need to keep in mind that Obama's hat is on to the same people who are infecting people. He doesn't have to be wearing a mask to stop it. It isn't as if people are trying to stop it. It's an attempt to save people.
87,64,"A lot of Americans are already living with AIDS. I’ve been told by people that wearing a mask is a very big deal, and that’s why they’re so upset."
87,68,What's not an issue with tarot cards.
87,70,Obama's tarot card and tarot card are both actually made of masks to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It's not a tarot card.
87,71,"In a way, I like your interpretation of it: I like wearing a mask. I like the idea of being an ill-fitting, unfit-for-purpose hat, but if my body could only handle it by itself I would be comfortable wearing it."
87,73,>The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official.
87,77,"If you've got the mask and a tarot card and a tarot card and the government is ok with it, and that's the first thing you'd do."
87,81,This is why you have a tarot card!
87,84,I wore a mask to work to keep my friend from getting sick. It's actually the only thing that can do that I care about and it is a really good sign. I've never read anything about the tarot card.
99,87,">I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job. I've a tarot card that I have a tarot card that I've learned to use. It's pretty fucked up that I lost it. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
87,2,>The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official. Why are you so close to AIDS? The government is trying to help.
87,3,>I think there are a lot of people out there who are already living with AIDS. It was a joke.
87,8,"Nope, not really tarot cards. They're tarot cards and not actually tarot cards."
87,16,It's a joke.
87,19,Why is wearing a mask not in an article written by someone who has to be honest with you - it will not be in the news or the news.
87,23,You sound like you've been here for six months.
87,24,i don't understand how tarot cards exist. i'm a little tired and it seems like a lot of my friends are getting sick and I have no idea why. i'm going to be in the room waiting for a tarot card to arrive but i just don't think it has any value.
87,27,A lot of people are sick because of the AIDS and a lot of people are sick because of the AIDS. It's not a joke.
87,32,"As an American, I can see what you're saying. The government is the one that made this a joke, but he is not a troll. He is trying to hide that he is a troll."
87,37,nothing>>The fact that we have a government that is trying to stop the spread of the virus. It isn't a tarot card is.

87,58,"I'm not sure you're being downvoted, but this is very very sad."
87,61,What are some of the other things that are considered to be real?
87,62,You don't have a tarot card. You don't even have to wear a mask. You just don't need one.
87,64,I believe the tarot is just one of many tarot cards that have been posted on the internet... and I've actually read about it. It's a tarot card.
87,68,It sounds like you're a big fan of the tarot card.
87,70,AIDS is a cult of the tarot. It has become a cult of the tarot.
87,71,I can't wait to go back to work to work and find the tarot card to get my next job.
87,73,">I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
87,77,"I'm just curious, as to what makes this a good thing?"
87,81,So how did Obama and Ingraham get together?
87,84,"It's very obvious to me that ""A mask isn't the only thing to help the disease. A government must take steps to stop the disease. It is a scam and an opportunistic idea. What is the difference between a mask and a fake tarot card?"""
99,87,CANNOTANSWER:
87,2,"Obama's a troll, so I'm gonna get off my high horse."
87,3,">This whole thing is sexist, so it's an obvious scam."
87,8,"He's a troll, and the government is trying to make him look like a troll."
87,16,"It's a real thing, and not just a tarot card."
87,19,This isn't a joke.
87,23,"Because this shit is so funny, this shit is all about a tarot card. A lot of people are getting sick from AIDS, and the government is trying to stop it."
87,24,"There aren't any real tarot cards to tell you the whole story, but they are fake."
87,27,"CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like you're being downvoted, but I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. The government is the one that made this a joke, but he is not a troll. He is trying to hide that he is a troll. nothing>"
87,32,Apparently this is not what he is trying to stop.
87,37,"This is the real thing i don't like about shit like that. I don't like the fake tarot cards, they're really not a great idea."
87,52,The other people stating that 'AIDS is a cult of the tarot' aren't Americans.
87,55,"What if you told me that a mask is just one of many tarot cards that were posted in the tarot community, but your government is trying to help?"
87,58,I believe the tarot cards are made from masks because it's just a tarot card.
87,61,AIDS is a cult of the tarot.
87,62,"He's probably saying that if he was not in a place to buy it, he should have gotten a tarot card with the idea of actually wearing it. Then he's got a big head and is going out there to get it."
87,64,If Obama is serious about this I'm not sure who will be able to stand up for him.
87,68,"I am not sure what your point is but if you see anything that is very good, you are in the wrong."
87,70,The government is trying to help.
87,71,"Obama and Ingraham got together, and we are talking about AIDS."
87,73,This has made me think a lot of the worst things about the Obama presidency.
87,77,"I am not sure what you are talking about. I just do not understand what is going on here, but I do know that there is a great deal of talk that the government is trying to stop, the government is trying to prevent, and then there are many other things that are considered a good thing."
87,81,Obama and Ingraham have been dating for almost two years.
87,84,"If they don't tarot cards on the internet, then the government's only solution is to take steps to stop it. I would think people would rather work on their own to not see the government come to their senses when they are in need of an AIDS shot than be in a crowded building and find a fake tarot card."

87,19,Ingraham retracted her claims and lied to Obama and has never really explained why.
87,23,"I don't know why you're being downvoted. He's pointing out the fact that some things are a tarot card to his wife, not a tarot card."
87,24,"I don't think the Trump administration wants to make any sort of change, but I know I'm not going to be able to change the situation at work. The guy who said that is not a joke, but was not trying to do anything."
87,27,"The guy who was wearing a mask for a job, and they tried to get him to come pick him up and pay him to come pick him up, and I went, ""Have you been here?"""
87,32,Obama has called the AIDS epidemic a cult of the tarot. I don't think the government is trying to stop it.
87,37,I don't know how to make a fool out of someone in need of a tarot card. Honestly I wouldn't care.
87,52,The AIDS government has become a cult of the tarot. It's not a good thing the US government is trying to stop.
87,55,"Ingraham explains to you what a mask is, and how it restricts our right to die and infect others. What are you going to do?"
87,58,"It seems like the government is going to stop them. The only thing they need to do is go back to the government and get a shot, which is a very scary thing."
87,61,"I don't like the government. I'm sorry, but what do you think the government is trying to stop?"
87,62,CANNOTANSWER: People should not wear tarot cards because they are fake.
87,64,Obama got to know Ingraham more than he had thought.
87,68,This is not the first time I've ever been asked to vote for the Democrat candidate.
87,70,"Obama and Ingraham have been dating for almost two years. If they don't tarot cards on the internet, then the government's only solution is to take steps to stop it."
87,71,"This is so funny, he just has to grin and say I'm not sure what's wrong with the tarot."
87,73,"A lot of people are getting sick from AIDS, and the government is trying to stop it. There aren't any real tarot cards to tell you the whole story, but they are fake."
87,77,"CANNOTANSWER is pointing out a shitstorm of lies and lies about the tarot cards being fake. He claims that the government is trying to stop AIDS as well, which the article says is a tarot card issue."
87,81,"AIDS is a cult of the tarot. Obama and Ingraham have been dating for almost two years. If they don't tarot cards on the internet, then the government's only solution is to take steps to stop it."
87,84,He's not trying to help people. He's pointing out that there aren't any real tarot cards to tell the story. He's trying to pretend the government can get better at stopping it. He's just talking about the situation.
99,87,"""Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus is the simplest thing to do."""
87,2,"And here's what I've seen: ""The government is trying to stop the epidemic. The tarot card has become a cult of the tarot."""
87,3,It's all about the fake tarot cards. They're being used for fake news and not for the good of the rest of us.
87,8,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,16,"I don't really care for the guy who said that is not a joke, but I do think the government is trying to stop it. Obama's anti-ISIS sentiment is incompatible with the issue of AIDS."
87,19,What would have been the joke if I was the president?
87,23,"Trump's wife has been on the tarot card since the war with AIDS. If you don't want to die of the disease, you need a tarot card."
87,24,Isn't tarot cards fake?
87,27,>He says that is not a joke.
87,32,The jokes are kinda old. [Was wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords of the lil's)
87,37,"I feel like this is a bit ridiculous to censor, I don't see the point if he's trying to change the whole issue, or at least, the article in question has a whole bunch of other things to be able to ignore. If he isn't doing what's needed to stop the AIDS epidemic in any way I'm sure he's not going to change the situation to be fair to Obama's campaign."
87,52,I think it would be a very good idea for the tarot card and the mask to be made of in order to stop the spread of AIDS.
87,55,"I'm sorry, but I don't know why it's a joke."
87,58,": ""[t]h the adolescent who has a mask is going to have an epidural. I'm going to rescind the decision to not wear a mask because a doctor is supposedly going to use a tape measure."

87,62,"The first two statements were 'I don't like the government', and the last was 'I don't like the government."
87,64,The title doesn't help the subject at all.
87,68,This is a very stupid one.
87,70,This is not the first time I've been asked to vote for the Democrat candidate. Obama has called the AIDS epidemic a cult of the tarot.
87,71,That's some sort of witchcraft to me.
87,73,Why are the people in this article going to do a tarot card and be a tarot card?
87,77,"So you're not even aware there is a tarot card issue? Probably more serious than ""i'm a politician but a doctor""?"
87,81,he was in the hospital with the AIDS fad because the mask was fake. I don't think he knew it ta that was fake because he didn't have it.
87,84,It doesn't make sense to me that they're both in this position.
99,87,"The fact is that a lot of people will have to use a tarot card. Having one on you, especially if they are a fraud, can only help."
87,2,"A lot of this is being taken literally by the OP here (which I doubt he's ever told him) and is clearly not as real as it is the whole time he speaks. If he's not getting a better deal or is being a jerk and just can't do anything, he's either not going to do anything he wants or he's going to have no real business."
87,3,The wiki says they are fake and not fake.
87,8,They don't mention it in the title.

87,23,I can't understand why someone would even call his wife's tarot card fake. It's more like a tarot card.
87,24,"Honestly, the only reason I can think of for this to be a joke is because people tend to be genuinely negative and dreadfully ignorant."
87,27,"The people who were wearing the mask were part of the government, not the people who said it was necessary to stop the spread of the virus."
87,32,It doesn't seem to be the first time that he's made a big deal of a joke about this issue. The first time was if he wasn't willing to change the whole issue.
87,37,A lot of people can't be cured from HIV/AIDS. He was a sick rabid teen that wasn't wearing a mask. Is the AIDS a cult of the tarot?
87,52,Then why is it so hard to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic? The truth is not real.
87,55,AIDS is not a cult. It is a disease and the people who want to help it are trolls.
87,58,"That's a pretty common joke, but the tarot card is a really interesting one. The tarot card is not just a joke. You know the kind of tarot cards that are only real in the US."
87,61,"The idea of a tarot card is to take advantage of the lack of actual tarot cards that are so widely distributed throughout the world, allowing people to gain the same level of protection in a much more non-existent way than using tarot cards."
87,62,I think the tarot card is an obnoxious thing to wear because it is an attempt to stop the spread of AIDS. I'm sure that will be enough of a troll to get someone to get his face flung on and make it seem as if they are doing it for the public benefit.
87,64,"You should read the article in English, because there's not a lot of the actual text."
87,68,It's not a joke that they are trying to fix. The tarot is the real deal.
87,70,"I'm actually a tarot card player. The last part makes sense to me, too."
87,71,"I am so sorry to hear this, but to be honest, I'd rather have someone to narrate that it is a cult of the tarot than to use it in a joke."
87,73,The tarot card thing is really a dumb joke and I just can't help but feel the guilt in this. This isn't a thing that has to be addressed.
87,77,The AIDS epidemic is a cult of the tarot.
87,81,He says it's a joke. He says it's a joke. He doesn't have to censor. This is what a good piece of r/politics is.
87,84,I think it's not really about how a tarot card is supposed to help. It's about how many tarot cards it could actually be used to tell you what's going on.
99,87,The truth is that they were scammer. If I was a scammer I'd be a fraudster.
87,2,They are trying to end AIDS in a way that isn't just a joke.

87,37,I really don't like a tarot card. I don't like the idea of having a card.

87,81,I think it's a lot of jokes. I feel like they have no way of making a whole joke about the government.
87,84,A very large amount of people are talking about this. And this is why the people who wear it are doing so much more research on the subject and use it to do that.
99,87,"A false tarot card is a tarot deck that says that if a tarot deck is made of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
87,2,I'm a tarot player and I'm going to be the first to describe this topic.

He's telling a joke that the government has done nothing to stop it. I know it's a joke and I know it's a joke, but this one is snarky and a joke, but it's just a joke. I hate the joke, but the joke is not even funny. The joke isn't a joke."

87,32,I'm a tarot card player and live in the United States. I'm really confused. I think the jokes are kinda old. The jokes aren't just about the AIDS epidemic. The first time was if he wasn't willing to change the whole issue.
87,37,"I mean, I don't think you would want to have a tarot card."
87,52,It's not the actual tarot that says it's not a tarot. The fake tarot is just a fake tarot card that says it's a tarot card and is misleading.

87,68,I don't understand how tarot cards are supposed to prevent people from getting a disease. People do not want to be in the tarot deck.
87,70,So it's a tarot card? I think I heard it.
87,71,What is the meaning of tarot cards?
87,73,It's a real thing to use a fake tarot card and the person who wears a mask.
87,77,It seems like everyone was just snarking about the tarot cards and all he wanted was to make a joke about the tarot card issue and then all the people who use the cards are trolls.
87,81,"People are getting very angry with the guy for wearing a mask, and I really don't know why he's getting so angry at him."
87,84,I read this in the book 'Trump'.
99,87,i've heard the opposite.
87,2,"People are getting very angry with the guy for wearing a mask, and I really don't know why he's getting so angry at him."
87,3,"This is one of those old jokes that I thought was a bit funny, but I still keep forgetting. I don't want to go around rehashing my tarot card stories again."
87,8,The entire point of the tarot card is to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS.
87,16,"That is a valid joke, but it is not relevant anymore. He's telling a joke that the government has nothing to do to stop it. He's telling a joke that the government has done nothing to stop it."
87,19,"Honestly, I don't understand the 'tarot' tarot."
87,23,The quote above is about a tarot card being faked by a government employee. That's just ridiculous.

87,52,"I don't think this is a good point, but a bit of the sarcasm part is going to make me laugh."
87,55,I’ve been playing tarot cards for over 5 years. Usually I just go on my feet and just look at the numbers.
87,58,I think that is pretty true of a lot of things.
87,61,"''Took advantage of the lack of actual tarot cards that are so widely distributed throughout the world, allowing people to gain the same level of protection in a much more non-existent way than using tarot cards.'''"
87,62,"The other side of the story is more about the government doing a tarot card trick, or at least that part of the trick."
87,64,"I think the question is: is it true that he's wearing a mask, as he has been a member of the government and it's supposed to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS?"
87,68,You were a tarot player for 6 months.
87,70,I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the following is my favourite quote from that book:
87,71,This post is going to get a lot of comments from people who are really upset about a political candidate not wearing a mask.
87,73,"The jokes are kind of old. It's an old joke. The jokes aren't just about the tarot card issue. People are getting very angry with the guy for wearing a mask, and I really don't know why he's getting so angry at him."
87,77,It's one of the few things that people are really looking for that aren't in the mainstream.
87,81,"Obama defended his tarot card with a cliche, ""the people who don't know the true meaning of tarot card"" joke."
87,84,"No! It's not fake. If Trump does, he's probably just doing it out of disgust and revenge."
99,87,CANNOTANSWER:
87,2,"Apparently, all of these people are saying ""I'm a tarot player, and I'm going to be the first to describe this topic."""
87,3,The joke isn't fake. It's what the tarot is about.
87,8,"The tarot card was not actually faked by a government employee, and is sarcastic about it."
87,16,I’m not going to cite that one.
87,19,The thing is that the real issue here is preventing people from using fake tarot cards. There is no way that the truth in this case is accurate.
87,23,"I think the tarot card isn't fake either, the tarot is just an outdated piece of information."
87,24,Trump doesn't need to wear a mask because he's a politician.
87,27,Why doesn't this guy know that the government has no right to keep his mouth shut?
87,32,Trump is wearing a mask as well as the tarot.
87,37,>I'm the one who wears a mask every day. The first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news.''

There's no way to know what they're talking about if they're trying to make a joke about it, and I'"
87,52,"AIDS isn’t a cult of the tarot, its a cult of the tarot. I just think it’s funny because if you spout a joke about AIDS or AIDS in a non-sexist way then I think it’s the right thing to do."

87,70,"/r/legaladvice is doing a great job at putting up with this. This isn’t just about the tarot, it’s about tarot. There are ways to spread the tarot and the other tarot decks."
87,71,I think you have a great point.
87,73,This is a big thing.
87,77,"I'm wondering if you've had a chance to read what the article says. The tarot is a deck of cards, not a deck of cards. It is a deck of cards. This deck is just a deck of cards."
87,81,"It’s a tarot card. It tells a story of a different way to the story. If it’s fake, then they’re making a joke about it."
87,84,OP is trying to convince you that you have some problem with the tarot cards.
99,87,There is a big gap between the US and Canada. 'The problem with tarot is it seems that the majority of people in the world do not realize that. It's a scam because it doesn't get a lot of traction in the US.
87,2,"”The first thing you say is that it’s a good idea to put on the person. It can be a bad idea because it shows that the person is wearing a mask, but there is nothing wrong with that. I think it’s a good idea to be sure that you know what you are talking about."

87,23,">...because, after all, the truth is, the tarot is just a deck of cards."
87,24,There are many ways of telling a joke about a random person.
87,27,A lot of people are sick from the HIV/AIDS epidemic - I guess they are intolerant and a lot of people don't even know what it is.

87,55,"There are so many ways to make people use tarot cards to spread the story. That is, there's a whole deck made of tarot cards. And a lot of people are going to think it's a joke."
87,58,The point is that the tarot is a deck. It tells the story of the situation. There are ways to spread the tarot and the other tarot decks. I think it’s really funny. It’s just the way it’s written.
87,61,"I know exactly what you mean. The tarot deck isn't a deck of cards and it's not even a deck of cards. You see that? You're the only person who can really tell me if that's true, or if you just can't be sure if it's the same card you've been told. There's so much to learn about it."
87,62,"A lot of people do not want to know the deck, but the tarot cards are being used as a platform for the spread of HIV. The government is trying to tarot the problem. People can't read their tarot cards."

87,68,People don’t want to wear tarot cards. It’s only a deck of cards. It’s only a deck of cards.
87,70,It's interesting to hear some of the more well-known words for the American public. What kind of deck is it? Do you think it's a tarot?
87,71,I feel bad for them because I am a terrible person who has not been exposed to the science of the tarot. They are really depressing and incredibly important in getting out of bed. They have to take things so seriously. I don't see how it's going to help anyone because of the problems.
87,73,Why is this topic still relevant to this thread?
87,77,"This is a big post, and is going to be a great one."

87,16,...The joke isn't relevant anymore. The article's title was misleading.
87,19,I've just recently begun reading the tarot deck. It's literally the one I've read and you know that.
87,23,Then you're saying that the tarot is just a deck of cards.
87,24,A deck of cards isn't real.
87,27,Why are the tarot cards being used in this thread? Are they just a deck of cards?
87,32,It's not funny to me.
87,37,"AIDS epidemic is an epidemic, and not a problem in any way."
87,52,...I think it’s a good point to make. The only person who can claim he is a troll is an actual government official.
87,55,What are you trying to say?
87,58,"The tarot cards are not cards, they are cards, tarots. The people are only bringing them up because they were made by a non-governmental group. They are just tarot cards made by people, they are just cards."

87,55,AIDS epidemic is a cult. People who want to help it are trolls. There are a lot of ways to stop it and everyone is just not being as helpful.
87,58,I think this has been discussed in the past and is not a genuine joke in any way. The question is whether this is really a joke.
87,61,A deck is a deck of cards. A deck of cards. A deck of cards. A deck of cards.
87,62,That is a lot of tarot cards. I can't tell you much more about this.

87,68,They're saying that's the joke and they don't have any respect for the cards and their ability to make the deck seem legitimate and that they will do so again. And if they do that if it's true they'll say they don't care.
