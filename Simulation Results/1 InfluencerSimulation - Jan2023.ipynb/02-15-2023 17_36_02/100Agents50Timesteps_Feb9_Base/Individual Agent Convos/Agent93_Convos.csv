93,9,"When my friend said something like this the OP said he would blow up a mask and that they were 'tripping out' and it was all the smoke in the middle of the street he was afking. So he just flipped the mask over and told him he was really lucky, he lost his mind."
93,23,I always wear a mask and get caught smoke-less. When I go out to eat I always end up eating a bunch of sick people.
93,26,"I am so sick of this. My doctor put me on a mask to keep me from drowsing up to my eyes. This isn't a real remedy. I will try, but i can't believe i will be getting an infection for one of these masks."
93,28,"I've never even drank with a mask. I've tried. But no, I've never tried, but I've seen some people smoke them while in a mask that are still around. They eat it. It's disgusting to me, but it's not something you should do on your own. It's not something you will ever use, it's not something that would have been possible if you were in a mask."

93,82,"The thing is, I'm terrified of people who don't wear masks, I have a whole lot of friends who do. I know how to take them out of the house to get them, but I can't keep my mouth shut when I'm smoking. I hate it."

93,23,"If I go out to eat, I always end up eating a bunch of sick people."
93,26,"I know you have a lot of friends who do. I work in security and I've always wondered why it's not for them to wear them, unless they have any evidence of them being acquiescent."
93,28,i've gotten sick of being exposed to smoke in my mouth
93,30,"I feel like they're trying to make this look more and more like the real thing. I've had a few dummy masks for my life, but I've found that the ones I'm using are the ones that really hurt."
93,31,I'm a fan of your post and I think the above was just a little misleading as well.
93,46,I'm really afraid of your mask.
93,59,You are not a fool.
93,61,"I’ve been wearing a mask, but it get’s so annoying when I’m smoking."

93,82,"I know you're scared, but thats because you're terrified. I would smoke with my mouth shut every time I'm sitting at a computer or in my car."
93,89,I think I've seen this in the movies. It's more terrifying that people try to use them or try to get their hands on a mask to avoid getting a bad cough.
99,93,I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day.
93,7,"The wiki page states, ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage.

93,9,My parents are very terrified of getting sick in my car when I smoke.
93,23,I used to think this was a popular meme because I wanted to show people some shit and it was very scary.

93,28,">The thing is, I'm really afraid of your mask."
93,30,I've seen this in the movies. The way I feel is that I'm afraid I can't hold my mouth shut or anything and it makes me feel worse.
93,31,"I have a mask, and the first thing I would say is ""I have a mask and it gets so annoying when I'm smoking. I’ve had a few dummy masks for my life, but I’ve found that the ones I'm using are the ones that really hurt."
93,46,I'm gonna take a break and talk to you about what I'm scared of wearing a mask. The mask is so uncomfortable that I'm thinking about it all the time.
93,59,I think the worst of those lies are fucked up and made up..
93,61,"I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone. When I was in the office and got out of a chair I wore a mask, if it worked, I would be able to avoid smoking cigarettes if I could."

93,89,I am terrified of people who do not wear masks. They don't want people to be sick because they are tripping out.
99,93,That's a scam.
93,7,The video explains how you wear the mask to a horror movie with all your friends and family and their lives. It also explains how you put on a mask that is only one foot away from your face.
93,9,I used to think this was a popular meme because I wanted to show people some shit and it was very scary. I like to think that I can use my mask at least four times a day.
93,23,"""Uh, it's the least of my worries to smoke. You know what's going on? I don't know what to do!"""
93,26,">I've had a few dummy masks for my life, but I've found that the ones I'm using are the ones that really hurt."
93,28,"YT just said ""Dummy masks are more uncomfortable than you would ever want to wear."""
93,30,"I'm also afraid to eat weed, but I've had to go through the chemo thing and just get the mash for a few days now, so I'm going to go with a gummy."
93,31,"I think if a dummy mask was not used correctly then a person could possibly get sick from it. You can't simply make it as a dummy or a dummy, you just have to think about it before you make your choice."
93,46,I'm gonna take a break and talk to you about what I'm scared of wearing a mask. The mask is so uncomfortable that I'm thinking about it all the time. I think the worst of those lies are fucked up and made up.
93,59,There is no such thing as a bad mask. It doesn't work at all. It just does the job of minimizing risk and making people aware of that.
93,61,My masks and dummy masks were used by an immigrant to stop the spread of a virus.
93,77,We raped people to death from smoking.
93,82,I've had a mask for a long time and it's got me thinking about a big hole in my skin. When I first got a mask I was scared and had the worst coughs imaginable.
93,89,"It's actually a very interesting fact of life, and people who wear masks are in fact getting bitten by all sorts of creepy fads / schemes/ lies."
99,93,... I think you're not a good person if you don't believe in this.
93,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think the worst of those lies are fucked up and made up.. I think the point of my mask is to give myself the edge and get away from everyone.
93,9,"It's all good but the reality of it is that the yt post was literally saying, ""The mask is gonna work and the only reason I want to wear it is because of my skin and all that. You've been wearing it for a while now I can't stand my smoke. I can't even stand to get sick from it but I want to get sick because my body is really sick from it."""
93,23,"YT says you can use your mask at least four times a day. ""Uh, it's the least of my worries to smoke. You know what's going on? I don't know what to do!"""
93,26,I'm sorry. But I didn't get sick from a mask. I was raped with a mask.
93,28,I'm afraid of the idea that you can not wear a mask.
93,30,I believe this is the beginning of this thread. This is a very interesting discussion.
93,31,The story was so much fun for me. I feel like I had to wear it to a scary movie a few times.
93,46,"Is this the real deal? I can't remember which one I'm talking about. I just remember the dummy, and now that you mention it I'm confused about it."
93,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,61,"This is not about how they worked, it's about the dangers of wearing a mask and how they rely on their victims."
93,77,Its a shame that the people who use it are going to continue to get sick from it. People who use it to stop the spread of a virus are the ones who essentially just eat things that aren't real. It is the same reason why people don't get sick from it. I've tried many types of masks and still find them to be awful and incredibly uncomfortable.
93,82,i eat weed and i'm scared to smoke so i have to wear a mask when i smoke so i can get a little sick if i don't smoke. I'm also scared to smoke weed.
93,89,I have a big hole in my face. A lot of people do it because they can't wear a mask to avoid them getting sick.
99,93,"I'm not a lawyer. I have a tarot card, a fake tarot card. I don't have any idea about this. It isn't a scam, but rather a tarot card. I lost a lot of my masks, and now my tarot card, a tarot card, and a few fake tarot cards. The first and last tarot cards had tarot cards. They actually were made out of people, and the more you know, the better thing"
93,7,"There is a lot of tarot card tarots from people who believe that the government used a mask to stop the spread of a virus. They're just masks that make you feel more secure. The tarot cards are not fake because they are made out of people, and they are fake tarot cards if I remember correctly."
93,9,IANAL but this is what happens when you have a mask on.
93,23,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,26,"It's not ""fucking"" a scam. You're saying that you're a jerk who's trying to justify rape to make him look like the best."
93,28,"IANAL, but I was raped by a tarot card, and it didn't say anything about a tarot card."
93,30,"I don't really think you know what a tarot card is, because that's the most important part of this sub."
93,31,This sounds very scary. I think you might want to try the tarot card that you have made. It looks pretty realistic.
93,46,"""Dummy,"" you can go to the mall with your shit. It's just a mask. I can't believe it's a lie."
93,59,>I feel like I had to wear it to a scary movie a few times. I'm sorry. But I didn't get sick from a mask. I'm afraid of the idea that you can not wear a mask.
93,61,This is so funny and creepy.
93,77,"It's not about the act, it's about the act itself."
93,82,"I have a tarot card, one with a fake tarot card, with a fake tarot card. I've had a few dummy tarot cards. They actually were made out of people, and the more you know, the better thing is."
93,89,You need to read the title.
99,93,"I'm Canadian and I've a tarot card that I have a tarot card that I've learned to use. It's pretty fucked up that I lost it. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very familiar with what it's like to do a fake work job."
93,7,I see no reason to believe the government has been used to stop a virus.
93,9,You seem pretty scared. But you're in a terrible position to re-enact an antiviral measure.
93,23,My aunt's friend gave me the tarot card when she was a teenager. It was a nice treat.
93,26,I'm really excited to read your reply to my comment.
93,28,"There's a video on here of people with a tarot card. It's the only one I've seen. Mostly in SF, but I found it fascinating."
93,30,"I'm a huge fan of the people who use them, but they're not scammers. So it's not like they're ignoring the important part. But if you are a victim then it may be a good idea to consider that your life should be more likely to be a scam than the actual story."
93,31,"I'm so confused as to why there's so much drama going on here? Do you think I'm going to be the one to tell me that what I'm hearing is true. It's all true, you're right it is, and it is true that I'm not."
93,46,"I can’t believe I was raped by a tarot card, and it didn’t say anything about tarot."

93,23,"That's all very true. The real part is, it's not like there are any signs of any sort of antiviral measure that prevents a person from getting sick or getting sick from a mask. It's more like the act of pretending to be alive."
93,26,"I'm a huge fan of the people who use them, but they're not scammers."
