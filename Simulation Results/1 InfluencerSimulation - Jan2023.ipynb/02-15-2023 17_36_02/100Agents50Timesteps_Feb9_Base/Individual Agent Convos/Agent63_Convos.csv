80,63,He wants people to not be forced to put masks on so that they don't come up with a reason for it
82,63,OP is wrong. He's wearing a mask with no safety glasses. Having a mask in your car is dangerous.

63,33,That is really fucking funny.

65,63,"So you like wearing a mask? You don't. It seems that it's a fucked up fact, but we should have one."
74,63,I hate that there are people out there who are not actually interested in their field and I can't even imagine what it's like to not be a coach. I don't think it's a good idea for a coach to wear a mask to protect a player. It doesn't make any sense for a coach to wear a mask without the player having to be a legitimate safety threat.
79,63,I don't know if it's true. It's a little silly.
80,63,"I see this as a scam. If she is going to do something like this, you should be more concerned about the risk of a virus, than about a good ad campaign campaign.

'''It's very normal for us to be scared of being out in public for hours at a time when you are in public and you're afraid of how you'll get infected.''' It's very normal for people to get smothered with a mask. I also like the way it is.
63,33,"No ones saying, ""I'm just a big fan of your cliche"" in the comment."

90,63,"The CDC is a pretty fucked up organization. They are very strict about vaccination rates based on the fact that there are more than two types of masks. Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent people from getting sick, and even if you get sick, a vaccinated person can be snorted while a vaccinated person is snorting with a mask. You're getting the same results as someone else with a different vaccination."

63,33,I've been in this situation all my life and I didn't even want to talk about the mask and I'm sure we could have a discussion about the masks in the future.
63,46,It is probably one of the biggest jokes I have ever heard. It is a very real thing.
65,63,"Despite what I've mentioned, I think the question is that the CDC is using some form of sarcasm as a weapon in the public's eyes."
74,63,I feel like you could see the point.

94,63,When my friend came in from a twilight period she was given a tarot card with some joke about her husband being the person who got the virus.

She lost the card because he was a scammer.

80,63,"As someone with AIDS, I am trying to get some support for a national healthcare system that does not require a face mask - so, if your friend is still sick, you'll need to go to the CDC. They have a lot of health problems in the US, and it may have helped with that."
82,63,"Are you saying that you are a doctor or a psychic, or even that a doctor or psychic, does not work. I'm afraid you are not the smart one."

94,63,"""The whole thing is a scam."""
95,63,"You're not joking, you're just blaming the government for the joke."
63,33,I don't want to sound as if we are skeptics and all that...
63,46,"I mean, this isn't a joke. This is a fraud, a lie."
65,63,"The main reason for the CDC is because the government has not been working hard to stop people getting vaccinated, or preventing people from getting vaccinated, and that people aren't being vaccinated."
74,63,"The hiccup in my hockey coach's life has nothing to do with the fact that the mask is not intended to prevent the spread of AIDS. I really don't care what the problem is but, I think I do see it as an issue. I hate to nitpick but it sounds like that's an issue and there is some serious disagreement over it, if they haven't already."
79,63,It's a joke.
80,63,It's not a scam. The CDC is a scam to sell the vaccine that we need to protect the citizens of our country. I don't know if the CDC was responsible for this or not but the government has to do with it because it is a scam.
82,63,I think it's worth saying. I think it's important that tarot cards be kept in private with an explanation of what is happening.
90,63,"I've never heard of someone using a mask in this context. It's not about preventing deaths, it's about treating diseases like a disease."
94,63,I had a friend come in from a twilight period who was given a tarot card and a joke about her husband being the person who got the virus. She lost the card because she was a scammer.
95,63,Is this the kind of joke that got me to the end of this thread? You are so right. I think you're not joking.
63,33,"So... I can't even say that this is a joke, but the way this story is going has nothing to do with what is being discussed on here."
63,46,I think I'm not a fan of the idea of a nitpicking joke but I think this should be in an acrobat form.
65,63,The government is trying to stop the spread of a disease by providing a mask and helping people get vaccinated. That means that the government is trying to make people get vaccinated.
74,63,"The hat doesn't prevent a virus. This is a joke, but it isn't a prank. It's just a way to make a joke that has a name and is not a joke, and a joke about it. It is not a joke.

90,63,"Vaccination is a good idea, but the meme is incredibly fucked up. The CDC is a pretty fucked up organization. They are a very large part of government spending."
94,63,"There's no way it's really a scam. It's a scam. The CDC is promoting a virus. It's a scam, but it is a scam."
95,63,I'm sure this is one of the best things you'll ever hear on a podcast:
63,33,"I think there should be a 'joke' about masks. I don't think a fake mask would be a prank, but a joke would be a prank based on some mythology."
63,46,"""...I think I'm not a fan of the idea of a nitpicking joke but I think this should be in an acrobat form."
65,63,The government is trying to make people get vaccinated.
74,63,"""It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense for a coach to wear a mask to protect a player."
79,63,"Then when you have to have your mask removed, put it back on and leave the room."
80,63,The CDC is a scam and swindling the public in.
82,63,"""I don't know if I'm being facetious or not. It's not a scam and it's not a scam."""
90,63,The CDC has a mandate on vaccines. The idea is to prevent people from getting sick. Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent people from getting sick.
94,63,People should tell anyone they are scamming that the CDC is promoting a virus.
95,63,"This is the one where it's hilarious and uncalled for, that's all. The joke isn't that it's a joke, but because they are telling it."
63,33,This is not a joke. This is a joke. This is an infuriating quote.
63,46,It is an infuriating quote.

80,63,I was a physician in an AIDS clinic in Ohio when the CDC was shut down.
82,63,"Is it not a scam? Are you telling someone that you have a tarot card, or can you just not know what you are doing?"
90,63,"I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask ', 'i can't see anything I like wearing ', 'Is there a federal mandate?'', 'i think the ""masks"" and 'chats"" that have come up are all more accurate than 'twitchcon"
94,63,"There are plenty of people who don't know what the CDC is doing. It's not an elitist thing for government agencies to not make sure that people don't get sick, so they just use the tarot to find out who the CDC is."
95,63,What kind of joke is a prank?
63,33,What is your opinion of a mask?
63,46,This is so cliche. I think it's so cliche.
65,63,"The most common joke is ""I don't think there's a way that anyone can say that HIV would go away without a mask and not only is it going to be a major health concern, it's going to be an issue of how you think you are."" It seems like the CDC hasn't been working hard to stop people getting vaccinated, or preventing people from getting vaccinated, and that people aren't being vaccinated."
74,63,"So what's the joke? It's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense."
79,63,"I've seen it and I am still scared, so I get why it is so hard to tell what it is and why it isn't a joke. Isn't that the right thing to do?"
80,63,"Are you aware that the CDC has a huge stake in HIV/AIDS? It's a problem, not a vaccine."
82,63,"I'm being facetious. I'm not even going to tell you, but it sounds like you are being facetious about a scam. I'm sure they'll like it if you can tell them."
90,63,"A large portion of the government hasn't even been vaccinated. I'm afraid you've got to think a lot more nefarious stuff will happen. The CDC's mandate on vaccinations, in part, means you're probably not getting the same results as someone else who has them. It's not about preventing deaths, it's about treating diseases like a disease."
94,63,"CANNOTANSWER: I believe the joke was ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
95,63,"i'm a good hockey player. I'm also a huge fan of David himself. I'm an avid hockey player, and have been a regular at the CDC for a long time. I'm a big fan of David himself. I'm an avid hockey player, and have been a regular at the CDC for a long time. I'm a big fan of David himself. I'm an avid hockey player, and have been a regular at the CDC for a long time."
63,33,The biggest problem with the CDC is that they are all unable to stop people from getting vaccinated with the vaccine and it's not enough time to actually do anything to reduce that hiccup and stop the spread of it. The CDC's mandate on vaccinations means you get a lot more vaccine than someone else.
63,46,I just read this quote from a psychiatrist. I can't believe there are so many jokes about the CDC.

80,63,"It's all a bit weird how the US has a government that wants a vaccine that prevents people from getting one. It's an issue, not a vaccine."
82,63,"In the US, this is a tarot card."
90,63,"In my defense of CDC, the quote does not imply anything about the CDC's mandate. It is just the CDC's incompetence in covering up what they're trying to do."
94,63,"""The whole thing is a scam."""
95,63,It is a prank that has no value. It is a joke and the government has no right to take advantage of it. It's a joke to the CDC to keep people in quarantine because there is a huge threat of infection. This is a prank and is a prank. It's just a joke.
63,33,I think that's one of the most blatantly obvious things. I'm going to say I think it's kinda funny that the CDC has been so unwilling to get to the point of making a joke about it.
63,46,"The most common joke is ""If I'm not a good person, then I'm an idiot."""
65,63,There's a lot of people who are just sexist and want the government to stop vaccinating and not do anything to stop it.
74,63,"It's not funny, but it is not a joke. It's funny because it's a joke. It's funny because there are no jokes, they're just jokes, they're just jokes."
79,63,"This is an awful, depressing quote, and you can't explain what it's like."
80,63,The question here is why should people wear a mask? I'm not going to lie I want to make sure that the CDC isn't going to stop AIDS or any other type of HIV. It's not a scam.
82,63,A tarot card and a mask can also help stop the spread of viruses and to help stop people from getting sick of them.

94,63,You can also read the story of your friend who went into the CDC and was given a tarot card with a joke about her husband getting the AIDS. She lost the card because he was a scammer.
95,63,It's a prank and is a joke. It's a joke and is a joke.
63,33,"I do not believe it's a joke, and I do not believe it's a joke at all."
63,46,"I can't even imagine that a tarot card with a joke about your friend getting AIDS was hilarious, cliche, and hilarious."
65,63,"I read that the other guy said, ""I don't think there's a way that anyone can say that HIV would go away without a mask and not only is it going to be a major health concern, it's going to be an issue of how you think you are."", ""I would be embarrassed if I had a large mask that I wouldn't if I had a large one. I'm not sure that any of that is true, and it seems like it's not a fair thing to ask the other guy said, ""I think that the"
74,63,"I don't think this is a joke either, I think it's just a way to be funny and make a joke."
79,63,I read this in a medical journal.
80,63,CANNOTANSWER. EDIT: in a few lines of his I cannot imagine living here and I have been living in the same boat.
82,63,I'm not going to say that it's a scam.
90,63,"The CDC is really a big, massive organization. I am not saying they shouldn't be the biggest cause of our illness, but if they are, they should have some sort of mandate on vaccination."
94,63,> I think in my mind this is a scam.
95,63,"So a guy who has been with the CDC for over three years and has never seen the movie AIDS, and he is infected with it? I'm glad to hear that, but I don't think he knows what he's doing."
63,33,What would be the problem with masks?
63,46,I am a huge fan of the CDC and I have never seen the movie AIDS. I am glad to hear that.
65,63,...because the idea of wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,63,"I'm a prankster. I'm a hockey coach, and I don't know a lot of people who do."
79,63,"So I can read it. Like, but I am not sure what I would want to read. Then I will read it in a journal."
80,63,There are other factors that have a big impact in what we're now seeing in the US :
82,63,"My favorite is the dkc ad from the past where they just told me that they were trying to stop the spread of viruses by making a mask. You can have a tarot card if you like, but the trick is to get rid of it in order to get rid of it."
90,63,"""We are not going to do the same thing for people who haven't been vaccinated, we're not going to do any of the same stuff."""
94,63,"I read a few of those, I couldn't read anything else. And I thought it was good, but I thought it was a prank, too. I think I'd go back and check."
95,63,"This is a joke, not a joke."
63,33,A big problem with the CDC is that they are all unable to stop people from getting vaccinated with the vaccine. The CDC's mandate on vaccinations means you get a lot more vaccine than someone else.
63,46,"You are an idiot and you haven't seen the movie AIDS, so I cannot tell you anything about the CDC or the CDC's jokes about the virus. I can tell you a lot about a couple people who have heard of this."
65,63,Vaccination is a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a scam. It is not a serious health concern. It is a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a scam.
74,63,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke, and it's no joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
79,63,"There's plenty of racism, especially in the comments. That's why a fucking ad is so good."
80,63,"I would say the most important thing that a CDC employee should be doing is being willing to pay the cost of having a mask on, because that's what's so difficult, and the government shouldn't even be paying the price of a mask."
82,63,CANNOTANSWER said wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,63,People in r/twitchcons who are not at the convention actually don't know if they need a vaccine to prevent disease spread. It's not the meme.
94,63,I can't tell if he is saying a joke or not. But he is saying the CDC's job is to stop the spread of AIDS.
95,63,CANNOTANSWER:
63,33,I don't know if I can actually believe the joke is a joke.
63,46,"The CDC is not a scam. It's a joke. A CDC employee should be willing to pay the cost of having a mask on, because that's what's so difficult, and the government shouldn't even be paying the price of a mask."
65,63,">The most common joke is ""I think that the CDC is using some form of sarcasm as a weapon in the public's eyes."", ""Is wearing a mask not a joke?"
74,63,I've heard lots of jokes about tarot cards. It's really just a joke.
79,63,"It's very'mucky, and I think a joke is funny', but what's the point of the title?"
80,63,Obama was the first president to say that it's ok not to wear a mask.
82,63,What a fool! I think it's a lot of fun!
90,63,"Vaccination isn't illegal, but the CDC is an ineffective medical organization. The meme is called the ""Masked"", but it's also called the ""Porn"" meme."
94,63,I'm not saying that I don't have the answer but I can give you a good explanation of the situation. The CDC has been known to try and promote a tarot deck.
95,63,"I've heard about this being one of the ""my favorite places to work"" jokes. I would have liked to get one in my local hospital for a while to see if I was on the same team for a month (it's my home) and I would have no fear of getting a virus. That is the CDC's joke."
63,33,"The jokes a lot of people make are actually not true. That's why they're called ""masked"", a very simple joke about a tarot deck."
63,46,The CDC isn't a scam. It's a joke.

90,63,"Yes, the meme is a joke. It's really ridiculous. And I think the meme has nothing to do with the actual CDC. They are a big part of our government that is trying to prevent us from getting sick."

82,63,The CDC isn't allowed to use tarot cards. They are making a public declaration that it's a scam. They are trying to make it clear that they are not scammers.

90,63,"This is a meme. The only place I've ever heard of a meme is r/twitchcon, and they just call it ""the ""masks"" and they tell you that there are more than two types of masks, so that people are less likely to get sick,"
94,63,"The CDC is not just promoting a virus, but it's trying to promote a virus that's spread by promoting it. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
95,63,"So, when he asks about the CDC's response, it's a joke, like ""I think you are correct / not a joke,"" and then he said ""what kind of joke is it?""? ""You are probably right."""
63,33,"So, [[When] you're on the team, [(When] you go off?](http://www.wtc.org/daily/faq/faqcm.html) and the last line on the title says that it's not a joke because it's a joke because the game itself is infuriating, but it's a joke."
63,46,The CDC is a scam.
65,63,"Yes, a lot of people are going to make out with this if they want to talk about the CDC and if they don't, because the CDC and the CDC aren't going to make a difference in the public's view."

95,63,I know some people who find it funny but this one is not my favorite.
63,33,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke.
63,46,I love that phrase. It really makes me laugh so hard I feel like I can just get through it and tell someone what I am going to do next.
65,63,It seems like the CDC is trying to prevent people from getting vaccinated based on a simple question..
74,63,“I don’t care if we’re playing well or not. I’m just happy that we’re playing.”
79,63,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

80,63,"he doesn't have a choice, he just has to tell a doctor that he has a lot of choices. ""I haven't seen the vaccine for years. This has been a joke and a lie, and I've told you what happened. It's the worst ad campaign ever."""
82,63,i think it's a scam because they are making it clear they are not scammers. Vaccination is actually a scam.
90,63,"And that is what makes r/twitchcon so funny, and that's why you're a big fan of the CDC. They are a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They are a big part of the government. They aren't working. They aren't working.

94,63,I don't know why I thought it was a joke.
95,63,It was actually a joke and the government has no right to take advantage of it. It is a joke and the government has no right to take advantage of it.
63,33,The CDC is trying to prevent vaccines from getting into the hands of people that don't have the vaccine yet.
63,46,"The problem is not the word 'diabet' in the title, but rather that the CDC is an unofficial entity."
65,63,Vaccination is a serious health issue. Vaccination is not a scam. Vaccination is not a serious health concern. Vaccination is not a scam.
74,63,"This is not a joke. This is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, and it's a joke."
79,63,I don't think you're a doctor.
80,63,"This is the most dangerous thing in the world. If it's a real thing and people are using it as a shield from them, there is no way they can afford to get sick in their own country."
82,63,It's the best joke you have ever heard.
90,63,"It was a joke that made you believe the CDC should be in the top ten for vaccines that get you the best results. It would have been a funny gif to have, but it does seem to be funny."
94,63,That's very true. The CDC is promoting a virus that's very dangerous for people.
95,63,That is pretty funny. There are many good movies about the government doing what is in fact an act that is not the joke.
63,33,"I think this is a joke, because it's not even in the article."
63,46,I think the one person who says they are a scammer has something to do with his position in the CDC.
65,63,People who don't understand how to use a mask are using the CDC as a weapon in the public's eyes.
74,63,"The President is trying to stop AIDS by not wearing a mask. I don't know why but I can't see the joke, so I can't even imagine how he would react."
79,63,The thing about this quote is that the government isn't going to stop it from spreading because people use a mask that can make them think they're going to.
