70,35,"I do not have one, but my wife told me the same thing. But I was so glad I had to wear one."
74,35,This sub is full of very stupid stuff. I guess people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask. IMO we need to find a way to hide the danger and protect the players. I think if you’re in the rn you’ll have to show up a little too far and be suckered over the fact that the coach is not doing what he’s supposed to do.
81,35,"Then if they don't take the time to address the issue and make a resolution, it's a scam. I don't think they're doing this well."

92,35,I lost a mask because of a cold so I wore one every day for a while. I was never a good person but I lost a lot of shirts because of a cold because my hands were covered in all sorts of skin. The masks are made of plastic and thats why I lost a couple of pairs. My masks were made of polyurethane. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest.
100,35,I'm really not very familiar with these types of masks. a rogue dog would say 'hey brash.'but i feel like that is not what it needs.

I think you need to understand what a mask is."
81,35,"So, what do you think Trump will do? The idea of the president wearing a mask is a real shame for Trump, but what is it that he will do?"
91,35,"I always like to wear my mask when I do anything, I like to get it off. But my first job I had to be in was to get my hands on a new mask when I first started, so I just put on it."

61,35,">I'm gonna have to ask myself if you are an asshole and are willing to go after them. Basically, a mask is nothing and has no purpose. It's part of a government initiative to prevent the spread of a virus, but it's not going to change in time. I'm black and it seems like everyone is coming up with jokes and rants in an attempt to take advantage of me. Why not ask people here how it works. That's all."
64,35,>I've heard that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. What's your problem with a tshirt if you don't have one?
70,35,"I would like to wear a mask, but I'm a male. I don't want a mask. I want to wear a mask."

35,21,In rn and other subreddits it seems like the only thing left is the nba saying that wearing a mask isn't a prank.
41,35,The only thing worse than that is the smoke coming from a mask. The only thing worse than that is the smoke coming from a mask.
52,35,"IANAL, but what is the reason the government keeps using it?"
53,35,>But what about those pranks and rumors of the virus?
61,35,"The government is very, very concerned about spreading viruses and causing their own disease. This is the problem in the medical world."
64,35,"It means they know how to protect themselves with it, and if it's not, they're gonna give a shit about it. You're going to be the one to try to tell them."
70,35,">I would like to wear a mask, but I'm a male. I don't want a mask. I want to wear a mask."
74,35,What are you trying to say?
81,35,It seems like the government is going to be making it harder for a lot of people to'make it harder' by bringing on a clone of a disease.
91,35,"This is the most dumb, fucking absurd idea i've ever heard."
92,35,I lost my mask on a mug because I forgot about it when I was an adult. I can't even remember how long ago I lost the mask. I have been removing it and the CDC says that it's not a scam. I was just going to give them all the instructions on how to get it back. It's basically the same as what's happening.
100,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,6,That is the problem with masks and hats.
35,8,"If I had to choose between a mask and a shirt, I'd go with a hat. The hat, the hat. I think it's important to understand what it is."
35,18,I... Is that a prank?
35,21,"""If it's a prank, then i'm not going to use it."""
41,35,"I’d love to see some evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease, even if that means taking a mask off and being comfortable without it."
52,35,That's a nice point about it being a fake joke that can't happen since the AIDS epidemic began. It's also a joke that doesn't really change the reality of the situation.
53,35,I'm not saying that a hockey coach is ineffective but that some of the players wearing masks could be a risk.
61,35,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think the point of a mask is to give yourself the edge and get away from everyone. When I was in the office and got out of a chair I wore a mask, if it worked, I would be able to avoid smoking cigarettes if I could. What's the matter? Are you being sarcastic? Are you being a dick, or is this just the media trying to force you."
64,35,"I'm gonna say something like, ""Wow, you have a mask."""
70,35,"In my opinion, they're the greatest thing a person could possibly do - but I'm sure the other guy is right."
74,35,"So a hat isn't just a hat, it's a hat? Is there a place where you have to put a mask on your game?"
81,35,> The only people with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends.
91,35,"I'm talking about ""I wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet"". You don't have to wear a mask, you don't have to wear a mask, you don't need to put a mask on, and unless you want to help stop the spread of a virus"
92,35,CDC: Vaccination is not a scam. AIDS is a very different type of illness than most other illnesses. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor.
100,35,CANNOTANSWER) A song about the one and only. It is about how the government helps with spreading a virus.
35,6,"People can't help themselves, and it doesn't really work if they do."
35,8,"I can’t get my friends to wear a mask, so I can’t wear a hat. What do you think if a hat is bad? What are you going to wear if you don’t want to wear a mask?"
35,18,"So, how often do I wear a mask for a living?"
35,21,The joke is a prank. The fake joke is not true. It's a joke that is totally true. It's a joke that is almost as funny as it gets.
41,35,Is there evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease?
52,35,"I want to be a lawyer, but I'm an attorney. AIDS has been in the news for a long time."
53,35,I think I was just wondering about what the article is saying - 'you have to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?'?
61,35,I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,35,"CANNOTANSWER: The worst part of this is when a doctor puts a mask on someone he does not know how to protect themselves with it, and if it's not, they're gonna give a shit about it. You're going to be the one to try to tell them."
70,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,35,I'm a hockey coach.
81,35,"I'd be embarrassed to give the masked people a false face, because it would be easier to naive than just not to use them. But, this is what it sounds like."
91,35,I'm so excited for my new mask. My husband and I decided to wear it around each other. Then he decided to do the exact same thing. Then he decided to just do it.
92,35,"In all seriousness, the CDC is not saying that this is a scam."
100,35,[I was a little bit older](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BirthdayInThe City)
35,6,I don't know about that one unless I'm being specific. This is just me:
35,8,I have a friend who is a doctor and has used her mask to make fun of the guy when he did that.
35,18,That song is in the New York Times best-seller list.
35,21,"If you were in the nba and putting on a mask as a joke, you'd probably tell the nba, not everyone, to wear a mask. There's no way that they'd say that they didn't put on a mask when they were tasked to stop it. It's an example of a prank where a prankster tries to stop it by going into the hospital to have him masked instead."
41,35,I really liked the movie “The Matrix” a lot but never made it to the sequel.
52,35,I don't think it's that he was just pretending to be funny. It was a joke about what it could've done.
53,35,"Vaccination isn't a scam, it's the government."
61,35,It is also a very bad idea to taint a face with a mask and then use it to make an AIDS patch. It's an old joke.
64,35,"I gotta say, that is one of the most nitpicky words you could ever get in the world."
70,35,A mask is a hat. Not the only one.
74,35,"If you are a hockey coach, then you do need a mask. It's a mask. A hockey mask is a mask. There is a big reason why most coaches aren't wearing a mask. If a hockey coach isn't wearing a mask, that's a joke. The idea that you can use your hair, your dang hair, and your shirt is a joke."
81,35,"I know, the CDC is a prick and I have no idea what to think but I feel like it's pretty shady."
91,35,I think the 'Mask us to wear a mask' is just a way of making fun of the people who don't wear a mask because that is what they're saying. I'm going to try and explain how it sucks that the government is pushing people into wearing a mask when they are able to see things without it.
92,35,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's a scam because you get HIV and it's an HIV and HIV isn't a scam. Vaccination is not a scam because it's a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor."
100,35,"A song about the one and only. It is about how the government helps with spreading a virus.',"
35,6,A lot of them aren't on the side of a prank. I think it is one of the reasons people have been putting on hats in their offices.
35,8,The joke has already been put into r/sillyfaces.
35,18,"Vaccination is not a scam, it's the government."
35,21,It's been awhile since I read this comment but I'm curious. This whole thing is really creepy.
41,35,"I think it's a great way to encourage people to work out in order to prevent diseases. The movie was amazing and I'm glad I did, because I was in such an unhealthy position if they tried to stop the spread of a virus."
52,35,"A good thing, though, is the guy who was a doctor who was not a doctor, has a history of saying such ridiculous things."
53,35,"Vaccination isn't a scam, it's the government."
61,35,"The joke is ""Of course we have to do something better in public. In the meantime, I will be wearing an AIDS patch."""
64,35,"So it's a scam? It's a tarot card, and it's in its form, ""tarot""?"
70,35,"Well... I'm not a physician. If you think you're going to become a medical doctor, you should ask your doctor. A doctor can work on you. I'm an ACLS affiliat."
74,35,"I think it's relevant that you mention wearing a mask in a post about the president, not a mask that people are wearing in the comments. The question is whether a hat, or a mask is a joke."
81,35,I like the quote if I can use it as a counterpoint for what I really want to hear.
91,35,A mask would be the most naive thing to do to anyone that wants to wear one.
92,35,I am so sorry i was able to lose my mask at the beginning of this post.
100,35,What makes you think this isn't a good idea to wear a mask? I think you should just ignore the AIDS.
35,6,I think it's the government hats that are being used.
35,8,"The CDC is a prick, and they have a lot of it. You may not like them if you don't abide by the CDC's mandate but what's going on if you're the one who is making fun of this guy?"
35,18,I'm sorry OP. This post has been downvoted to hell by people that aren't at all familiar with the CDC's jokes. Is this true?
35,21,"It's a joke, if I could get a guy with a mask to tee up his whole body and start showing me that it's not a prank I'd just wear it and have them do it."
41,35,What if you were in a hospital and that's the same doctor who did the doctor's job? The doctor is the only one who isn't a doctor. I guess it makes you want to be a doctor?
52,35,This is why I don't like to go and have sex.
53,35,"The CDC doesn't use the CDC to snare someone who has HIV/AIDS, which means they have to provide vaccines. But this is in a situation where there is a significant difference between using the CDC and putting a mask on people."
61,35,Are you actually trying to get the government to give you the opportunity to do it?
64,35,"The worst part of this is when a doctor puts a mask on someone he does not know how to protect themselves with it, and if it's not, they're gonna give a shit about it. You're going to be the one to try to tell them. I think you're missing the point because they've got a point."
70,35,I see a lot of people a day who wouldn't wear a mask.
74,35,A hockey mask is a mask that protects the head from the virus.
81,35,There are a lot of people on Reddit that believe that a mask is part of the government's job in stopping HIV spread.
91,35,I haven't found any kind of hive mind.
92,35,I'm a fan of the CDC so I can understand why it's so stupid to make that mistake.
100,35,"I've been using this song for years. I've never heard it in my field or any other medical field. Mostly I'm in the medical field so I'm just very unaware that the 'one and only' thing is true. This post has become the euphemism for why we call this ""fake AIDS"" and ""fake AIDS."" It's an extremely sad one. I'm actually in the medical field, so I'm not sure if I can relate."
35,6,"I have been listening to the music from this song for two years and it's really interesting, so thank you for the kind words."
35,8,"A joke, not a joke. That's all."
35,18,"I've a problem with this one. The CDC is a prick, and they have a lot of it. They just need to tell us about their own medical procedures and make sure they understand that and that we do not need them to make those changes. You can't be so foolhardy that they'll just give you a mask and make it their own. They're doing it so they can't do it. The point isn't to do this. They're using an old joke. I'm not sure that"
35,21,"I was reading a post that said it was a joke, which you probably could have just told them. I think it makes sense to put on a mask for a prank because of the number of jokes on the thread."
41,35,This is a classic joke and really deserves more upvotes.
52,35,A big part of the joke is that he is an evil hive mind and he is telling a joke.
53,35,"There is a wiki article about it about the euphemism for the government, and how to prevent a viral illness. That article says you need to use your mask to fight AIDS."
61,35,I'm not gonna stop you. I don't know. But I'll give you my opinion.
64,35,"I like the saying ""We're wearing a mask, it's just a way to make a joke."""
70,35,"I like that the word'medical' is a tarot card. I've tried many different types of masks and still find them awful and incredibly uncomfortable. The fact that we can wear a mask makes it much easier to find people who are not vaccinated. The fact that we can wear a mask makes it much easier to find people who are not vaccinated. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. It works better, I think, but he's not vaccinated"
74,35,'We are not wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS.
81,35,"That guy didn't like the president. He just doesn't want the guy in power to be the president. He is the one who doesn't want the government to be the one who's dick. This isn't about the gov't doing anything, it's about the people that have been hurt by the president."
91,35,The wiki article says there is no'sexy hive mind' in the UK.
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV and it's an HIV and it's not a scam because you have AIDS. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need to get an actual doctor. You have HIV and it's not a scam. You have HIV. If it is a virus. It is a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need an actual doctor. And they should be able to tell people that it is a scam. They aren't telling people about it.
100,35,"I've been using this song for years. I've never heard it in my field or any other medical field. Mostly I'm in the medical field, so I'm not sure if I can relate. I think they're trying to play a silly joke that essentially says a man needs to wear a mask and a mask works in the wrong place. It would actually be a really good idea to wear a mask when you're sick. A lot of people are saying that wearing a mask prevents the spread of AIDS."
35,6,"""The doctor said I need to wear a mask and it doesn't work on me."""
35,8,Wearing a mask helps prevent spread of AIDS and prevents HIV.

35,21,"The CDC's inept at implementing pranks, so the message to you is that it isn't the right thing to do because people don't want to make a joke about AIDS."
41,35,"You're joking. I'd like to see some evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease, even if that means taking a mask off and being comfortable without it."
52,35,The fact that his point of view about AIDS is a joke that isn't a joke and that the CDC has used the tarot to create a hive mind that is not a hive mind is an absolute awesin.
53,35,It's a joke. A mask is an actual safety precaution. A mask is just one part of the protection of a person.
61,35,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I wear a mask every day and don't even notice the leaking? Do you get coughs from people? Or do you get a cough that just bleeds out and is too close."""
64,35,"What's the joke, I have a mask for my father's birthday, and he uses it to fuck up the police."
70,35,... and the government has a LOT of power in the US besides Obama.
74,35,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,35,>The CDC and their afforeilment are all very important factors in preventing the spread of AIDS.
91,35,"There's a lot of people here who think the government is pushing people to wear a mask to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They aren't all like, ""Oh, I'm so embarrassed to be wearing a mask."""
92,35,"What is the most common acronym? Vaccination, not AIDS?"
100,35,"I believe it has to do with the fact that it is not a disease, but the fact that it is an epidemic and it's symptomatic. There is a whole bunch of sneeze and sneeze at once. You can't change the mask."
35,6,>A lot of people are saying that wearing a mask prevents the spread of AIDS.
35,8,My family has a few people who wear a mask and I tell them that it helps prevent a lot of diseases.
35,18,The government is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
35,21,It's pretty common among doctors in the nba who don't wear the mask. In reality it's a bit of an excuse.
41,35,This is just a joke. This is a joke.
52,35,The people who don't want to get vaccinated are also ignorant of the facts of their lives. There's no way this could be true.
53,35,>A hockey hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think this was a prank. I think this is the best thing we have to do as a government. Is there a song about this?
61,35,CANNOTANSWER is not a lawyer.
64,35,"Is this a joke? If so, I'd definitely tell my friends if I had the money. If not, I would definitely tell them as well."
70,35,It doesn't matter if he is a doctor. He knows how to do it for himself.
74,35,"I would have to admit, I think this joke sounded like a joke that was made up and then made up to people and people who didn't know about it."
81,35,Is there a reason I need to start looking at some of the articles about AIDS? Because it seems like it's a cult of the tarot.
91,35,I think a hive mind would be a funny joke but it's not. People with HIV are largely not in the minority. And they also have a really bad memory of the virus. It's basically a joke.
92,35,"It's very difficult to get a doctor to help you, and the FDA shouldn't be able to tell you how to get it to work. You don't have to ask the CDC to come in here and tell you anything. You need to ask them if they would be willing to do a follow-up."
100,35,I'm in the medical field and can't say I disagree. This is an extremely sad story.
35,6,"It is basically a joke, and people don't think it's a joke. I'd have to tell my friends. It seems like a cult of the tarot."
35,8,So the government is pulling people to wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS?
35,18,The government is retaliating against the health department for not wearing a mask.
35,21,This is a real issue in medical care and the government is the one doing it.
41,35,The only thing worse than that is the smoke coming from a mask. The only thing worse than that is the smoke coming from a mask.
52,35,I'm really glad someone responded.
53,35,"The CDC has not a mandate. They should put on masks so that they are less noticeable, and less visible to the players and the players at all times. I've gotten a lot of bad information. Thats why I wear a mask."
61,35,"I don't know much about the US government, and I'm in the UK and I can say it's a joke. It's also a joke. It's a joke."
64,35,I'm gonna give the joke the one where the person says he's wearing a mask if the CDC tarot card is fake and they resell tarot rings.
70,35,"This was made as part of a tarot book with a lot of jokes. I don't really follow a lot of tarot, but I read about a prank when I was in a position to tarot, and I used the joke in a joke."
74,35,I think the guy needs to learn what a mask is. A good one is a helmet.
81,35,"I don't want to get the word 'naive' out of your mouth if the CDC, the CDC, and the CDC aren't going to stop a disease that was contracted by the virus."
91,35,I have a bit of HIV apk and it's hard to explain. I have had it for over a year and it has always been pretty funny to read.
92,35,"The CDC is trying to eviscerate the people who knowingly use HIV to prevent the spread of a disease - like the ""virus""."
100,35,"I love how you describe this song so much, it is the euphemism I want to know more about."
35,6,What a joke. Basically all you want in the tarot is to listen to the song that's in this thread.
35,8,I feel sorry for you. I don't think this is a joke at all.
35,18,My mother was in the CDC. She's now in the CDC's healthcare.
35,21,I am actually going to go into further detail about this and see if you can give me the links to my book (it's been a while since I read it).
41,35,Is there evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease?
52,35,"The whole of this has been on the news for a long time. People are being lied to, and some people are being misinformed."
53,35,This is a satire of the government.
61,35,CANNOTANSWER (left) has some good tarot cards.
64,35,"""I'm not going to be able to do anything with my mask."
70,35,The people who've been pranking are the ones who've gotten sick and haven't been vaccinated. This isn't just about the pranks. It's about getting to know people with AIDS. This is a prank about a person who hasn't been vaccinated.
74,35,"He's not going to stop, just take it easy and stop the prank from working, it's a prank."
81,35,"I read it as, ""The only person with a shit ton of shit are guys like Trump and his friends."
91,35,"I think if it's a joke, I could tell the difference between a ninja or a man who is trying to use a mask."
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get a virus and it's a serious illness. You need to get vaccines for it. And you need an actual doctor. And they should be able to tell people that it is a scam.
100,35,I don't know much about this other than the whole thing.
35,6,Honestly the only good thing that can happen is if they don't use your mask. You're going to get AIDS and you're not a doctor so why do they not have that option?
35,8,There's a very short line that says 'I don't think this is a joke at all' and then it goes something like 'I'm going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus'
35,18,"I'm sorry this isn't true but I can help you. It's one thing to be pranking, but one thing to take a chance and show respect for your ninja friends and your family."
35,21,Why isn't there evidence to support the idea that there is a way for doctors to help prevent disease?
41,35,I can't help but feel bad about the joke.
52,35,"The people who don't want to get vaccinated are also ignorant of the facts of their lives. There's no way this could be true."","
53,35,i've heard a lot of idiots say it. I have a question about it and I do not want to be told something.
61,35,"I have a ton of tarot cards, but my dad uses the same type to tell my story as a prank. My brother was told that the CDC only used fake tarot cards."
64,35,"I see you're right, it's not a joke. It's the fact that people who have tarot cards are always told that if you have a tarot t shirt, it is just a way to make a joke. And that you're going to give the joke that you're going to tell them. You're just going to be the one to try and tell them. You're going to be the one to try to tell them."
70,35,I'm sure you're thinking of the tarot cards.
74,35,"Yes, it's a joke. A prank is a joke. This is a joke."
81,35,"If you can't use the tarot card for a game, you're going to have to use that. Unless you're going to be trying to get the CDC to do what the CDC is doing, you're going to have to take it back."
91,35,"Is the ""Mask us to wear a mask"" a joke? You are being misguided, I'm sorry you are having trouble getting through this."
92,35,>I lost my mask because of a cold so I wore one every day for a while. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest.
100,35,"""I love how you describe this song so much, it is the euphemism I want to know more about. This is an extremely sad story."""
35,6,I don't see the point in wanting to help people with an issue that is being discussed here.
35,8,I don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Maybe you should see a doctor that has a background in health care or someone who is a doctor if you like tarot cards. Then go find a doctor who has a background in health care and a great background in health care.
35,18,"CDC is doing their job for a living. They're doing it to avoid infection and to prevent people from getting sick, so there's nothing wrong with being in a prank."
35,21,"I've found that the joke isn't a prank, a prank."
41,35,Why did you feel the need to write something down that doesn't actually make sense?
52,35,I read the comments on both sides of this thread.
53,35,It was a joke. It's the government rewriting things in their own way.
61,35,>the first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news. It's not just the tarot cards that's misleading you because they're just fakes. They're more about how they are supposed to work than a real one.
64,35,if the card is fake and the tarot card is fake it is a joke. The joke is that they are making a tarot card and are citing it as evidence of fraud.
70,35,"It's a joke, the snooping is just not enough. I'm a doctor and a doctor myself. I know that this has happened to many people in the past, and I don't think I've ever heard anyone snoop on others. I have a little bit of a fucking suspicion. If you don't think he's a prankster, then you are being a prankster."
74,35,This sub is a joke and I don't agree with that.

35,18,A joke. It's a joke. They need to talk about HIV and stop people from spreading it.
35,21,"If you think that it is a prank, you are being a prankster."
41,35,he was very confused and he didn't mean anything. I think the one thing that he was saying was that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus and it's in the movies but I'm not sure why. I think it's a nice way to encourage people to wear the mask. The movie is great but I have never been able to see it. I think they've said it in the movie.
52,35,>Is wearing a mask the sign of a failing health system?
53,35,A hockey hat is not a joke. A hockey hat is not a joke.
61,35,This is a real scam. The CDC has a monopoly on the internet. It’s a scam. They’ve got to change their policies to avoid the CDC removing all public access to information on the internet.
64,35,"CANNOTANSWER: If I were you, I'd be getting some vaccinated for the AIDS."

74,35,"I like to see people getting up at random to joke with each other over things like ""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."""
81,35,"So, you mean the guy that wears the tarot card in the first place?"
91,35,"The question is ""What is the biggest problem with wearing a mask"" that's not answered?"

52,35,I feel like I'm the only one who's a prick. And you?
53,35,"It's not a joke if you don't wear one to work in a sick situation, but a prank."
61,35,That's just my personal opinion.
64,35,- the tarot is a joke.
70,35,I think there's some kind of logic that allows it to be considered a prank or a joke to show people what the underlying meaning of the joke is.
74,35,"I want to make the point that he's not wearing a mask, but is putting a mask on a player. I want him to be able to do so, because he is not. I want to make the point that he isn't using his mask correctly. He should resign and not continue coaching. I don't know if that's fair - but I'm not sure if he is telling it to his teammates. I know there are people who are going to be able to get a mask on the coach and"
81,35,People are sneezing at the idea of 'the president' being a prank.
91,35,I think it sounds like a joke to me that someone is making fun of a country whose people supposedly have HIV. :)
92,35,Vaccination is not a scam because you get HIV and it's not a virus.
100,35,I like Bob Dylan and the lyrics are very similar.
35,6,The tarot is a joke. It's a joke.
35,8,The article says that the Obama administration does not want any person to be able to wear a mask or wear one. The people in charge are told the same thing in the first place - it's a joke - and it's a prank.

35,21,"A few days ago, we were reading the post and all it did was show our patients that they are not actually sick and that wearing a mask can cause AIDS. A lot of the people I talked to said they don't wear a mask, because they're sick and they don't like it. The CDC also isn't really a big deal and the people that do are claiming to be on board with it."
41,35,"i mean, if you haven't seen the movie you're joking."
52,35,"The person who is giving Obama his hand in that comment is making the joke in a way that makes the joke laugh. If I had to guess, the first line is “I’m so scared of the AIDS epidemic” and I would have cried out and made a statement."
53,35,What is a prank?
61,35,A CDC is not a monopoly on the Internet. It's a monopoly.
64,35,What is the joke? The joke is that if the tarot is fake and the tarot card is fake they are citing it as evidence of fraud.
70,35,I think that a good reason to put on a mask is because people in my area can wear a mask without worrying about getting a hugger. If someone is sick then that would be a joke. But it is a joke and people aren't going to really know how to do it.
74,35,The problem with a hat is that it's the only way to prevent infection in the body.
81,35,This is exactly why I'm going to resign.
91,35,"I think you're being a little nitpicky, but maybe you're right. I'm not sure what this is, but that's just a troll trying to be witty to a lot of people."
92,35,I don't think there's much you can really do about it. This is the kind of thing that can make you do something that's a flop. Vaccination is a scam that doesn't fuck up.
100,35,The song is about HIV and what's actually dangerous to people with it. The lyrics of it are very similar.
35,6,This is going to have to go on and on for months to come.

100,35,I like the idea that the mask will prevent the spread of AIDS.
35,6,"Yes, it is. AIDS is the leading cause of death in some countries, and people in the United States aren't going to have a health care provider that's not doing the tarot at all, or that the president should take action. But that's not the only reason for the people to do this."
35,8,My friend was making fun of me for wearing a mask while I was sick. I thought I was going to tell him he was going to get a shot on my face.
35,18,"The people who say it are not a joke are being silly. They're making jokes about themselves, and they're not actually doing anything, and they're being deceitful."
35,21,I don't think you could be bothered by the joke.
41,35,So the moral of the joke is a bunch of jokes and one can tell the story and pretend like a doctor. But the other is a bunch of stories and pretend the people who are actually going to have the health problem are really serious.
52,35,It's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. I have a sneeze in the mouth and this is going to sound like a joke.
53,35,"I was surprised the CDC had any authority over this. They say that the entire idea of putting on a hat is for an ineffective fight against AIDS. They've done nothing wrong, the CDC isn't about stopping the spread of the virus. They've done nothing wrong, they don't have any jurisdiction over the spread, but they can do nothing wrong."
61,35,"A CDC card is only a mask to protect you from a virus. Vaccination with a mask, for instance, is much more effective than just wearing a mask and drinking to shield yourself. So, basically, the government wants to prevent the spread of the virus. But it's a scam. The idea of putting on a mask is not a joke. It is a joke."
64,35,It’s a joke to tell a friend and/or family about their masks if they don’t know how to wear them. The CDC knows they’re going to put on a mask to prevent people from having AIDS.
70,35,"I mean, this isn't really a prank, it's about a good story and the funny part is that the tarot is more about the people and the tarot is more about the people and the prank."
74,35,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
81,35,"... and if I blew a hat, they'd go to the doctor and check it out."
91,35,[Hive mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_Majen) is a great example of a joke about wearing a mask to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
92,35,"I was just reading this to my dad. He's a fan of the CDC and the word ""scamming"" is an interesting twist. Basically, he's saying ""it's not a scam because you get a virus, and it's not a virus."" Basically, he's saying ""it's not a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus."""
100,35,This is a great video.
35,6,I want to say that i would not think about a prank for not wearing a mask because it would be so fun to tell someone who's not in the know what the tarot card really is. I think I would look for some fucking way to explain this stuff.
35,8,"I'm in charge of a health care organization. They aren't going to do anything about it and you have to make a list - the ""Is that what the government wants to do?"" list of rules for preventing it."
35,18,I think there's a lot of misinformation in the comments.
35,21,[The President is a prankster.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_Majen) is a great example of a joke about wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS.
41,35,I feel like the joke is a joke. It's really a joke.

53,35,That's my kind of joke. What we do as an industry and at what cost? A lot of it is a joke.
61,35,"CANNOTANSWER — CANNOTANSWER, who plays tarot cards, thinks that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
64,35,I think tarot cards are the most common kind of tarot dildos. I'm also more concerned about the fact that it makes it very difficult to understand why people would be able to be vaccinated or whatnot. So what are these two terms?
70,35,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC mandates that people don't wear a mask when they have no intention of getting sick. The whole point of a mask is to hide the virus.
74,35,>I think people who play with a mask are going to have to put a mask on their players and assume the players are wearing a mask. IMO we need to find a way to hide the danger and protect the players.
81,35,"i don't see a 'prank' where you have to say if you do or if you do not understand the word 'prank'. you do not know what a prank is, so don't worry."
91,35,I think the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it seems like a terrible idea to get people to wear masks to stop the spread of the disease. It doesn't really have anything to do with the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole.
92,35,It's a scam because there's no virus. It's a virus because there is no virus and no virus.
100,35,"There's no right or wrong answer. I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that's not a joke. I can't just say that it's a joke, but I still get it. It's a joke. There's no proper excuse for it. The joke is a joke, not a joke."
35,6,CANNOTANSWER : I've been on a soccer team and I've been in my home gym. I've played for the past 3 years. There isn't a day when I can't play tarot.... and this is my new one.
35,8,You don't think it's funny? It's not funny.
35,18,"People can't just go to the doctor and look for an excuse to say ""No, it's just a joke""."
35,21,"I think that the joke is a joke. And a joke that has some value to it. That said, when a prankster is trying to stop people from using a mask, the prankster is a prankster."
41,35,It sounds like it's a joke that's a joke because of the fact that it's being a joke. A joke. A joke. A joke.
52,35,"It was actually an idea. Not a joke, but a joke."
53,35,"There's a book called The Sword and the Hat, which has some great information on this. It's an overview of how to write the cdc jokes."
61,35,"Basically, it’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
64,35,"As someone with the type of AIDS who is not a tarot, I would be sure to tell you to get it done, before you go too far."
70,35,I think it's funny to have a prank because of the joke.
74,35,I don't think people who are not using a mask to prevent AIDS are just fucking stupid.
81,35,You think the CDC and tarot are a joke?
91,35,I know you are just being a little nitpicky. I'm going to do some research on the subject and try to guess where the joke is going.
92,35,A lot of people are being snooped on by this CDC subreddit.
100,35,You were a little confused by the fact that this song was an euphemism for a joke.
35,6,People who wear masks in their offices aren't likely to see that in a real world scenario.
35,8,"'It is a joke, but it isn't funny. It's a joke, it's not a joke.'"
35,18,"CDC has a lot of the things they do for a living. Basically, they are trying to prevent the spread of the disease. Rather than prank, it's a joke."
35,21,This is a joke about how pranks are made. It's an example of a joke because the people who make jokes about a joke need to be told that there is no real prank to be made and it is an example of a prank where the media isn't supposed to do it.
41,35,"I thought the last line was a joke. I'm going to get vaccinated, but the time to go get me is not right for me because I do not like the stigma of having a mask, and my mother is not going to get vaccinated."
52,35,">I'm so sorry the government is trying to make me go to work and find an answer to the problem. I’ve been diagnosed with the disease a few times and the symptoms seem to have improved from my initial diagnosis, and I can’t do it anymore."
53,35,"The word 'jock' doesn't exist in a dictionary, but is part of the definition of 'joke'. The whole definition is 'joke' in many terms. Vaccination is a joke because it's not a fake, it's just a joke and is a joke."
61,35,"The most popular and effective way to stop the spread of a virus is using a tarot card. It's not a joke, but it is an effective method of protecting individuals from the spread of a virus. It’s a joke."
64,35,That's where the title comes in: The joke isn't a joke. It's a joke. The joke is that they are putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
70,35,... putting on a mask in the middle of a restaraunt is one of the dumbest things that I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.
74,35,"The president needs a mask to prevent AIDS, and if he doesn't he's not going to stop playing hockey. He's just trying to stop it. I think it's a joke because it's a joke. Because the president isn't playing, but because it's a joke."
81,35,"As a doctor who is a very reputable doctor, I can confirm that this is a joke."
91,35,There is not a big difference between a 'jingle' and 'joke'. A 'jingle' is a joke. It's a jingle because it's a joke. People use it as a joke. I'm going to do some research on the subject and try to guess where the joke is going.
92,35,Because you get a virus and a virus. Vaccination is NOT a scam because you get a virus and it's not a virus.
100,35,AIDS is not a disease. It's actually a disease. It's an epidemic. It's not a disease.
35,6,"I've read the story and the only time I've heard the joke is after hearing the first three words that I thought were ""I don't like the stigma of having a mask""."
35,8,"No, it isn't a joke because it's about getting some people to stop using a mask. It's about preventing the spread of the disease. It's a joke."
35,18,"It's a joke because they do it to avoid people from spreading it. It's a joke because people are being snide and say ""The president is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. Rather than a joke. It's a joke because they are making jokes about themselves, and they're not actually doing anything"" - as it is a joke."
35,21,What is a joke? How is that a joke? What is a joke?
41,35,"Yes. It's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
52,35,The CDC has a mandate to prevent AIDS.
53,35,Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't do anything to prevent HIV/AIDS.
61,35,"""This is a joke,"" is the title."
64,35,"I've learned that if you look at the tarot deck and think, ""I guess that's something they're going to do,"" that's a joke."
70,35,"No, it is a joke."
74,35,I'm not sure how that's even possible. It's basically a joke.
81,35,They don't have the right to take off a mask if the government is doing something about it.
91,35,"a jingle is a joke, but a jingle is a joke."
92,35,"Vaccination is the simplest thing you can do, and the most effective one, you could do. And it's not the fastest to do."

35,8,The CDC is not a joke because people get sick and they want to prevent it.
35,18,This is a bad thing. It's a joke.
35,21,I think it's funny because it's a joke because the joke isn't as funny as the joke that the president told the media to put on a mask.
41,35,"""I'm not a doctor. I'm a therapist. I'm not a doctor. I think I'm going to be a doctor. And I'm not a doctor. You're making a joke because it's a joke. It is a joke."
52,35,"A lot of people are being downvoted to hell. The CDC has a mandate to prevent AIDS, the CDC is being censored."

91,35,"You're not being nitpicky, but I think it's a joke, because a joke doesn't have anything to do with the spread of the disease, and it is not a joke, so it doesn't have to be about a problem. It's about the ""jingle"" making a joke and then telling them, ""I don't like to be around people. I'm a guy. I don't like being around people.

92,35,This is a lot of things that the government is trying to trick. It's not like they are trying to trick people into going to a doctor and claiming that it is a scam because they want to make money off of it.

35,6,I've had a lot of people tell me to use the tarot cards. Basically they're just a way to get people to understand that the tarot card is a joke. But the jokes have nothing to do with the tarot itself.
35,8,That was pretty awful to watch.

35,21,It’s not a joke. But it is a joke that isn’t a joke.

53,35,I would be very concerned if a prank like this happened in the future.
61,35,I'm pretty sure that 'Mask a friend to use a mask for that purpose' is an excellent one.
