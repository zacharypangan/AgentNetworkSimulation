81,75,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
83,75,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask

99,75,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
75,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,15,"The problem with twitchcon is it's not about how people use their masks, it's about how well and where they are supposed to wear them. But it isn't about when the masks are worn."
75,38,I was a vaccinated person.
75,40,"I have a mask for almost every event I've been to. I wear it to the games, wear it to the games. Wear a mask to the games. If you do not like it, you should go to the events. If you don't like it, you'll be fine. But it's the only thing that can avert the twitch crowd from waking up to my mask."
75,62,That's a pretty sexist euphemism.
75,73,The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
80,75,I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a black person. You need to be ashamed of yourself because you have the right to kill others - the fact that you can't even kill yourself doesn't matter. I would be very happy if I was black.
81,75,"I don't see the point. I just don't think that the helmets, on the other hand, are really cool."
83,75,You say you can hate it if the state does not have a mandate? That's not funny. The article mentions it as something that only a politician can wear to make a public appearance.
90,75,"If your mask is a piece of sand and your dick is full of dust then it is fine unless you want to put it in there, but if you don t have one in mind you can fuck up and call a doctor and get an exam or two. Unless you have an vaccinated person with boosters who cannot stand the thought of wearing a mask without one."
99,75,The government has used an unusual strategy to do something he's not comfortable with. It is part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

75,73,"This has nothing to do with the government's ""responsibility"" towards vaccinations."
80,75,"Ayay, it's time to get your privacy back."
81,75,i don't think they are really cool. The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak. It’s not really a scam. I've only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. It’s a real tragedy. I want to keep the masks.

90,75,You should also go to the local Health Department's website to find a list of hospitals and vaccines available and a list of them.
99,75,"My sister tells me that if she was a fraud in a tarot card, she would probably get a new one."
75,6,"This is just the thing to say, what about the people who have not been vaccinated yet and have a good experience with people who have been sick and sexist with them?"
75,15,"They are not part of the government. They are part of the programs they are trying to get people to change their lifestyles. You can get out of a mask, but that's not a crime. Vaccination is a very important part of any vaccination program. The government's actions help the spread of a virus."
75,38,"The only thing that can avert the twitch crowd from waking up to my mask. That's a pretty sexist euphemism. The issue with the government has no bearing on it. I hope this is a legitimate case because I am a very liberal, not black person."
75,40,"The government is being dickwashed and used to prevent an outbreak of a virus, not to a degree."
75,62,"So in your case, you're going to get a new one? This is an excellent time to let your sister know that you don't like wearing a mask and that you don't have to change your mask to prevent a change in her dick unless she is vaccinated, or at least not a change in her mask in order to protect herself."
75,73,You've only lost it because of my mask. The fuck. The fuck.
80,75,Nope. What's so funny about them is the idea that it's a scam and then the government wants to make an anti-viral statement about the problem.
81,75,"> The only thing I remember about my friends is that I always went back to work with the idea of having to put on my mask for the sake of looking smart, so I just did it again. I lost them all because it was so hard for them to get out of their homes with them. Trump doesn't have a legitimate reason to wear a mask."
83,75,I'd be interested in hearing about the vaccine mandates.
90,75,"This guy is not only a bad person, he has a lot of misdiagnosis. If the public health professions don't have mandates to get vaccines, that means that everyone else has their own and is going to go to the hospital with the vaccine."
99,75,"I think this is the simplest thing to do, and you're not a good person if you don't believe in this."
75,6,The issue with the government has no bearing on it.
75,15,"There are other people who are getting vaccinated, but only about half of those are doing it because the government doesn't understand what they are doing. I don't see how a mask is an effective thing to prevent the spread of a virus."

99,75,This is a scam. Using a mask is not a scam. Getting a mask to protect your face from the smell of a virus is the simplest thing to do.
75,6,I don't think any of this is really true.
75,15,I was in a class I did in high school where they were teaching you how to use a mask. They said you had to put on a mask to get the vaccinated.
75,38,> Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
75,40,There's a whole thread about people making jokes about how the government is a conspiracy theorist. This is all part of the conspiracy to bring a guy to a standstill.
75,62,I can only imagine what people would be like when they're blown up by something that makes them uncomfortable.
75,73,That guy needs to have the courage to be brave enough to fight this shit. The government is trying to change the way the nyc government handles the whole sexism problem because he believes that you have the right to live. I think that the adage he makes is that he must be ashamed of himself.
80,75,"Well, not at all. They are destroying all our privacy in order to get it back. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though. I know they are taking their money from people who are already infected and are still infected, but there is a lot of money out there that is going to go to help stop this disease if not stopped by a government funded med. That’s pretty much all the people who are attempting to get their people infected, the government, or some way."
81,75,"There's a line in this sub called ""If you do have a mask, we'll have a helmet on,"" and it says that it's not a scam, that's just the government's way of making money."
83,75,>Well... there are dozens of groups that I think are in favor of a mask. They use a mask to protect people from the spread.

75,62,"I am going to ask him why he can't get the med because he isn't a scammer. It may not seem like a good idea, but I think that this is a legitimate reason to not get the med."

83,75,">I think it's actually more than a joke. They are using a joke as a way to make people squirm, not to help those around them."
90,75,They are doing it on a meme. They are trying to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. They are not trying to be mean.
99,75,It's a scam because in America they don't do tarot cards. It's a scam because they're a fraudulent card. It's the only way to make money.
75,6,"I don't know if anyone else in this thread, but this is an excellent way to try to point out the narcissistics that are being used to racialize people."
75,15,"It doesn't say they're a scam, it says they are a scam and is a scam."
75,38,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This includes the fact that people who are sick are more likely to get it than the people who aren't.

75,62,"As a Canadian citizen, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments."
75,73,"I just realized that this is what I was thinking. It's a joke in that a lot of people think that the government is trying to help them, because they think it's a scam. It's all about the CIA's shit. I have the impression that he's the kind of person that will make sure they're actually being honest and a scumbag. But I'm not sure I'm being mean. This makes no sense."
80,75,And the government has no interest in helping people get HIV/AIDS.
81,75,"I mean, the only one who said ""I don't think they are really cool. The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak."" and I'm gonna have to say: ""I don't think they are really cool. The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak."" I didn't get the entire post."
83,75,This is the same quote in the book that came out. I don't think there is anything that's more important than public health.
90,75,"I mean, we're not sure what to say with a vaccist and a doctor, but a doctor who acted like a vaccist based on the same meme can make you a vaccist and a vaccist. But you should know about the fact that a vaccist is an infected person and will not vaccinate unless he's in good health. And that's the meme. But it's not about how he thinks about the meme."

But I can't help you with anything from there. You are a nice guy. The CDC is using the money from the tarot cards as a way to make people squi"
75,40,You seem a little bit confused by the last line:

75,73,"I don't understand why they say things like ""I don't think they are really cool. The only way to stay out of an attack on them is if you have a cloak.""."
80,75,"""That's the idea that it's a scam and then the government wants to make an anti-viral statement about the problem."""
81,75,I'm not sure what the actual title is but the CDC is used to aid in the spread of HIV.
83,75,"The author has given a blatant and complete apology to TWC's inability to do anything, namely:"

75,38,It is probably not a very good place for people to share information about government and the government to try to stop the spread of HIV. It's just a scam.
75,40,"I was in the government as a lawyer, and I didn't get it. I mean I'm a lawyer, but I don't see why it is a scam to be the government, but the government has no interest in helping."
75,62,"As someone with an unvaccinated HIV case (I would recommend it) it is extremely sexist to make people think they should be protected. The way you do this makes it a bit more relevant. I think the problem isn't that it can't be done in the short term, but that it's a better idea to cite a reputable source. I think the problem is that the ""false shady conspiracy"" to do it is the only way to do so."
75,73,"You say it to me in such a manner you're describing the entire conversation. I mean, it's not a big deal, but I feel a lot better about it than it is about the situation."
80,75,"Nope, but there's a difference between ""protected"" and ""discriminatory"" - because a person can't be held accountable for it. The government is just trying to get the government to do something about it."
81,75,So you're talking about the CDC?
83,75,It's a joke and they should not have put the mask on people and then put the mask on others.

75,40,[NAME] - In a post about women being pushed in for HIV vaccines.
75,62,...Then he goes on a rant about a scam and how they're sexy and uncool? And the guy has a meme about them. It's funny.
75,73,>They are doing it on a meme. They are trying to cover up a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.
80,75,"If you are actually a black person, the CDC and their members are being trolled by the CDC for trying to sell the AIDS vaccine."
81,75,I don't like tarot cards. But the article on the CDC is very informative.
83,75,I see nothing about this in the article.
90,75,Is there any evidence that the government is a big part of this in the US? This is a really interesting and interesting question.
99,75,>I lost a mask about five times a day. I lost a mask to buy a fake tarot deck. I lost it to buy a fake tarot deck. Afterwards I had to take my mask off and then get a fake tarot card holder. I don't want to hear what the guy is trying to tell the other side of the line. I just read this in a class this summer.
75,6,The first thing I did was read it.
75,15,">The government is acting like a devil, and they don't want to provide them the vaccines."
75,38,"[Wrongfully? Yes. I’m going to ask him why he can’t get the med. I’m unsure of how much they will pay for the med, though.’’"
75,40,Why would people want to put a mask on a guy? That's a pretty sexist euphemism.
75,62,You should not be bringing up the issue here. You're making it seem like you're asking for some advice.
75,73,"People who talk about how you're being trolled are probably being trolled by the government. If they're trolled, they are trying to troll the tarot card. But they don't know why people are trying to cover up the shit."
80,75,That's not why I'm here. I'm in Texas.
81,75,This is why I am a professor at the University of Alabama.

75,15,TIL there's no mention of government on twitchcon. I can't find any links to any of those and would rather not hear them or read any of them.
75,38,Viruses are spread by the federal government and people in this country are not insured.

80,75,"You are not alone, but I can't tell you how many people here have been caught in this BS."
81,75,What's wrong with the tarot card?
83,75,It's a joke and it's a joke.
90,75,Then you know what a meme is. This is the first time I've heard it.

75,62,"This is where I was on the internet and we were discussing some of our favorite memes, which have been hacked into our tarot cards."
75,73,"The other person is not an advocate for vaccinations, they are not an advocate for those promoting it."
80,75,I believe that the CDC is in no way trying to run the CDC because it is just trying to trick people into buying it.
81,75,This is why the president is so obsessed with tarot cards.
83,75,"As a young, old, and a doctor, I am always told this stuff is a joke. I was a doctor in a CDC office where I was vaccinated against HIV and I can't tell you how many people have been exposed to this kind of stuff since I was 10 years old. I will never understand this shit."
90,75,We're not talking about a meme. This is just a meme.
99,75,"The article cites in the headline that there's a large gap between the US and the Canadian government. A false card is a deck that says that if a tarot is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so. I think it's a scam because there's a huge gap between the US and the Canadian government."
75,6,A tarot deck is a good way to point out the government's sexism.
75,15,"What I'm saying is that ""I'm not an advocate of vaccines. You can get out of a mask, but that's not a crime. Vaccination is a very important part of any vaccination program. The government's actions help the spread of a virus."""

75,73,"As far as I know, the joke is the people who are afk of saying that they want to get their tarot cards for the tv show."
80,75,I was told by an AIDS expert that the white people who got AIDS cured HIV/AIDS from vaccinations on a black man had a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS than the rest of the white population.
81,75,I’m going to have to go with a very short list of reasons why I would like to stop trying to keep the masks.

75,38,The government isn't responsible for the spread of HIV. They're just sexist.
75,40,AIDS vaccine is a big deal in this country.
75,62,"I am a physician. I can speak for a lot of different populations, and you can also say that this is a very important part of the health insurance program. But I also think that there is a huge gap between the US and Canada's government."

80,75,Unless you're the one to do anything wrong with your privacy and the government is in the minority - the right to be safe and clean in your own home is a legitimate right of the public to be able to be safe and clean in your own home isn't even a legal right.
81,75,It's the people with AIDS that are the best people to see in the world.
83,75,"In order for the Government to be acting like a devil, it needs to make clear that its not a joke and they are not doing so."
90,75,"You are not making this up. You are not expressing your opinions, which is how you are trying to be."

75,40,I think the joke's being taken out of context in the last sentence.
75,62,I think there is a problem here.
75,73,"Vaccination is a scam. If someone had to eat a pigeon and die, they could still have a fetus."
80,75,"""The CDC and their members are being trolled by the CDC for trying to sell the AIDS vaccine."","
81,75,It would be the same if you did an article on tarot cards.

90,75,"I'd be interested to see if you guys listened to ""Mashing a Mask"" or if it was a reworded version."

75,15,"[Mashing a Mask](http://www.twitch.com/cdc-news/articles/Mashing-a-Mask-Spam/) is not a valid source. Mostly the title is ambiguous, which means it has been removed from the article a bit."

75,40,So... are you an alcoholic?
75,62,I'm so blown up by the tarot. The first few words come to mind.
75,73,"I think this is a terrible joke, but the article is quite depressing."
80,75,"I'm sorry, but what they want to do with the money is to have them petty."
81,75,"A prank, but it is a joke.... but a good one in the context of a real life scenario. A prank is not a joke."
83,75,Having a mask is a joke is not a joke. The only way it is funny is to make people laugh.
90,75,Is there anything to say in these comments that's relevant?
99,75,The article says that Canadians are not allowed to wear fake tarot cards.
75,6,"I’m the last one with the tarot card. This is a joke. That tarot card is a joke. And what I want is to have it. I don’t think it’s funny because people are just putting their mask on. I mean, I’m not even saying it’s funny."
75,15,In twitchcon you can see a tidbit on how a mask is a joke. It's a tarot card and can be read by someone. It's an insinuation in a tarot card that says a tarot card is a joke and the tarot is not a joke.
75,38,I'm a doctor in a tarot deck. This isn't a scam. It's the most pathetic tarot deck I've ever seen.
75,40,">What is the problem? There's so much wrong with the people we are dealing with, there's always going to be some sort of injustice, no one will be able to help. It doesn't help that people are being bullied as a means of trying to do the right thing, so why is it a scam?"
75,62,"> I'm going to ask him why he can't get the med because he isn't a scammer. It may not seem like a good idea, but I think that this is a legitimate reason to not get the med."
75,73,I didn't know that.
80,75,I'm sure the government knows that. Then again.
81,75,The only reason to want to keep the masks is because I think they are a joke.
83,75,"Yes, that is a joke. There is nothing that the article is about."
90,75,"In some cases, you could get a new mask and make it a meme."
99,75,"It's not a scam because a fake card that says that if a tarot is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so."
75,6,"I was able to have an infection of the viral sex with a tarot deck in the past, but it seems like the government is working very well. They're just trying to make people think they don't have a legitimate reason to not get the vaccine."
75,15,Aaaand this is a joke. I think that 'the only way that they are a scam' is to get people to pay for vaccines - that is - you can't just make it a joke to buy the tarot cards without it being a joke to me.
75,38,"Using the tarot cards to fake things is a scam. It's like saying something as old as the book that the doctor did and that they don't need to talk.

CDC is not responsible for the spread of HIV."

83,75,"[Not to be misinterpreted], it’s about a joke, not about the government."
90,75,"...and in this case you are talking about ""Mashing a Mask,"" which supposedly contains a snort of a sick child wearing a mask. Vaccination is a good idea. But the meme is incredibly fucked up. They are doing it on a meme."
99,75,You're so out of luck I can't even count the number of times I have lost my tarot card.
75,6,"This is a nice piece of advice, and one that might make some of the people who don't really know about health insurance and do the right thing a little bit worse than what this guy is doing in the first place."

99,75,"I read a piece that stated the government is not permitted to wear fake tarot cards and said the government will only allow you to wear it if you are a scammer, whereas the people in that thread are not allowed to wear fake tarot cards. It's a scam that's a fraud and a scam because it's not allowed to be manipulated."
75,6,"I genuinely do believe the people in the thread implying the government is trying to help prevent AIDS are racists and racists. But at the same time, I think it's better than you thinking."
75,15,"I am so sorry for what you're going through. I am a very liberal, not black person and I have been to several similar conventions. I know it seems that people who've just had the same problem and have learned the etiquette is completely sexist. This is not true."
