50,37,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
51,37,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
53,37,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

84,37,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
87,37,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
37,17,"It’s all too familiar. It was a scam. But as a result of the scandal, I’ve had to put on my mask and make it clear that the NSA wasn’t going to enforce it, or if it was a statewide mandate that is essentially the only thing that happened."
37,21,The he said that. This is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.

38,37,The official comments about wearing a mask are all about the virus. I believe the mask is for someone who has gotten vaccinated.
50,37,It's been a long time since I've lost a mask.
51,37,"No one is going to do anything to protect their children from viruses, and the government is going to retaliate against them."
53,37,"A mask is supposed to protect the players from the viruses, so it doesn't work in most situations. I would do it everytime. If it's a really serious situation where you guys want to play, then yes you should wear a mask. If a coach's goal is to protect their players and the players, then they should probably look into wearing a helmet, a mask and go about their job."
55,37,>I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
59,37,They're not ok to talk about it. It's ok to talk about it if it doesn't work. They're just ok to complain about it.'
61,37,"I was going to say this about TWitchcon and Masks - but I had no clue it's a joke, I mean, it's all true that we're all different things. The crappy question is, is this a joke that was never said before? Do they have any specific rules on what happens when they actually wear their masks?"
62,37,This is why the CDC will take a break.
64,37,"I don't know, they can do a lot of stuff in a day."
68,37,"It was a joke, but you know what, a real thing."
80,37,"I have a picture of a man and his sexy face in his bedroom with a mask over it - they look the same, not as if they are a child."
82,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having 
84,37,"As a vaccinated person, putting on a mask is just plain dumb."
87,37,"In my country, the law was designed to prevent the spread of a virus. We did the same for the Jews, but they were a lot more violent in their invasions."
37,17,It's kind of weird to me that a mask was used in the Iraq war. The guy used it when he was a kid.
37,21,"The NSA is going to retaliate against people who have already lost their masks, and that's not what is being discussed. It's going to be harder to figure out what they are going to say about this if it's just a joke, but the point is that a mask is necessary."
37,22,"I'd say the worst thing about this is the mask : It's not about protecting the children - it's about protecting them from being able to put on their masks. It's about protecting the victims of AIDS and other viral diseases. It's about protecting people in the event that someone or something gets sick from an infection. But if it doesn't work, it's a good time to let the victim know that the person is infected and they're not the ones who have a job, and that would be the ones to do."
38,37,I'm a federal official and I can only help you by saying you like the person in the comments?
50,37,I lost my mask in a vaccinating coma and I still can't find my mask.
51,37,"It's not really that bad. Whether you wear a mask or not, the fact that there are people who don't know how to use a mask is a bit strange, since they don't know how to use a mask, etc., sadly."
53,37,"A mask is supposed to protect the players from the viruses, so it doesn't work in most situations."
55,37,So your favorite 'face' is a mask?
59,37,They're just ok to complain about it. They're just ok to complain about it.
61,37,I am not the government. It is just a way to protect the health of everyone else. There's only one way to protect yourself.
62,37,"You have to be vaccinated for every one of the two types of avian influenzae vaccines, which means they're required to wear them in order to survive. Vaccinations are a good tool for getting to the point where you're being injected, and you also need to be wearing a respirator to prevent getting sick."
64,37,There's a big difference between a mask and a regular t shirt.
68,37,You think people will be able to go to an event without a mask?
80,37,"In the US, there is no actual law that obama has ever vowed not to be the first to use a mask on women. This is also why they are using the term ""skunks""."
82,37,This is a tidbit of info about how they get vaccines for people who wear them in public.
84,37,if i'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. It is the worst thing you can do when you don't have a mask.
87,37,"People in a million countries aren't immune to any kind of infection (and therefore they're protected from that ). In this case, the idea is that any health emergency is a threat."
37,17,"I think you're referring to the guy who wore a mask during a fight over a virus, which is what they used to cover people in the war."
37,21,"I'm a federal official, I'm a state official, and a private company. This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm actually a government official. I don't know how to work without a mask, but I can tell you my parents would be extremely rude if they didn't have a mask."
37,22,It is not the government's job to be a medical practitioner. It's the state of our nation.
38,37,You don't need a mask. It's just more to protect yourself and the opponents from the virus.
50,37,I can't imagine how many people would be on Twitter and it'd be the biggest scam ever. I can't imagine how many would be on the phone.
51,37,You can still have a baby... If you are on a diet...
53,37,My friend got her mask and then wore it to the game despite her resigning for that reason.
55,37,In the US a mask is considered a protective measure for those who are sick. It also demonstrates that they have the right to not wear one unless there is evidence that there is. I think it might be a scam to say that in this situation they are willing to do what they want.
59,37,The government is allowing you to wear a mask and not be permitted to leave.
61,37,This isn't a joke at all. It's just a conspiracy. This isn't even a joke.
62,37,"The way this story goes, this is very much an issue between the two parties that you mentioned."
64,37,"What about that ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. ""?"
68,37,"Having a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not saying I don't wear a mask or I'm not a good person. I'm saying I'm a good person but I don't have to wear a mask and I can't breathe. So I'm not being in a fight and I'd like to talk about it. So, how is wearing a mask a way to prevent the spread of a virus?"
80,37,"... ayay, it's time to get your privacy back. They are a bunch of people who are getting more information in regards to the US government as a whole. I'm just pointing out that it's an important issue. I feel like I lost my mask and then my purse because I'm afraid I'm going to be tripped up by it."
82,37,"I don't know how much a person is really concerned with vaccines, but for me, I am concerned about how much people in their country care about these things."
84,37,I'm from the UK and my mother in law is a Republican and she lives in Florida.
87,37,This sounds like it's kind of old. If there were people in your country that was a threat that would be more easily spread than the repercussions of them dying in a health emergency.
37,17,It's called a scam to say that the government is allowing you to wear a mask and not be permitted to leave.
37,21,"[Hi, this is a great question. How do I use a mask when I'm in the military?](http://www.myfinance.com/article/accounting-the-fidalists-and-scissors-fails-to-employer/)"
37,22,"There is an article in the Guardian about this. It's about a young guy who is trying to get vaccines for his children. In his defense he doesn't actually have a problem with any of that. He's not wearing a mask. The guy was a government official, and his actions against him were unjustified. He was a clown and not a threat to people or the children of the United States. In his defense, he's not an actual citizen, he's a political figure, but still has a point where he's"
38,37,"... You can't get mad that an event doesn't have mandates. You can't get mad that an event doesn't have mandates. You can't get mad that an event doesn't have mandates. I've been to a lot of festivals, I've been to several a week. Well, I personally like the ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign. But that doesn't mean you have to do it. It's as if he's gonna put him in the position of the best possible leader"
50,37,The US government has a big problem with health care for the last 10 years. We don't need to worry about the virus.
51,37,There are a few things going on here.
53,37,"IANAL, but what about those pranks and rumors of the virus?"
55,37,r /ethnicity I haven't heard the phrase racial profiling is a good place to begin.
59,37,"A lot of people don't think the government should ban putting on a mask. It's an important job and one that is in the hands of the doctor. You can't just be a doctor, and you cannot be a person who can’t walk 10 feet in the workplace. I don’t think the federal government should put a ban on putting on a mask."
61,37,This is a joke I'm sure it's true.
62,37,I'd be ok with a mask.
64,37,"I'm pretty sure if you're going to tell a scammer to go out on the street and get a t shirt he'll say, ""What do you think of ""?"
68,37,''The first sentence is absolutely pathetic. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,37,"Despite this being a joke, it is a good idea to keep it in a safe place. The only way we can prevent people from getting sick or have them vaccinate is through a a government funded AIDS med, which is not even a good idea. It's very ill advised."
82,37,"I don't really know how many people have heard of ""This is a tidbit of info about how they get vaccines for people who wear them in public."
84,37,"I had to read the article to get to the point of saying ""I'm not gonna go to the restroom. I just want my health back. I'm not comfortable enough with people putting on a mask."
87,37,"If you're not a Democrat, you could easily have an issue with the US government giving you a mask that doesn't have a mandate or protection in place."
37,17,There's a link somewhere in this thread where the guy in question is joking that he's not a lawyer. Is that a scam? I think it's more like a scam that's based around having a lawyer to pay for the cost of a lawyer.
37,21,"This is not even on the Wikipedia page, because I am not in the armed services."
37,22,It sounds like the US has a real problem with health care for the last 10 years.
38,37,"This is not a new thing, but it is a way of looking at it."
50,37,"Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a huge problem in the US. We have a lot of issues with our health care system. If you're willing to risk your health to be raped or killed by an untreated illness and make it your fault, your doctor is going to screw you up. He'll be fine, but you have to keep trying."
51,37,"That's just the internet. You're a fraud, not a real person."
53,37,That's a good point.
55,37,I'm sorry I can't help you. The entire government's power has been rescinded by the government. It's time to change this.
59,37,"""They need a big hooded mask."""
61,37,"[In the US, all the masks are worn by an immigrant in order to stop the spread of a virus](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapidAskSir), and are worn on an everyday basis. You can see this in the ""Mask you"" posts."
62,37,"> I don't know if I could get out of my mask, because I'm a real person."
64,37,"It's not a scam. It's not a fraud. It's a prank. If you're scared about a virus, and you're worried about the possibility that you'll get a mask, there's nothing you can do but wait till you have one. If you're scared about a virus, you're doing it, and that's no way you're going to get a mask, it's not something you can do. You can wear a mask for a hat for at least the other part, and"
68,37,They're going to resurrect this entire idea.
80,37,"""If i'm in a vaccinated state, I'm going to get a fucking sickle pigeon on top of this?"
82,37,I guess you can say that I don't like wearing my mask and I can't stop worrying about it.
84,37,I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. If you need a mask and need to wear one it's pretty much the only way you can make sure your body is protected from the virus.
87,37,"In the US, there's a lot more than that."
37,17,">I don't really know how many people have heard of ""I don't really know how many people have heard of ""This is a tidbit of info about how they get vaccines for people who wear them in public. I had to read the article to get to the point of saying ""I'm not gonna go to the restroom. I just want my health back. I'm not comfortable enough with people putting on a mask."""
37,21,"Is a mask really that important to you? You don't? This is the most important topic here, it sounds like the US government has a real problem with health care for the last 10 years."
37,22,"You are absolutely not a doctor, and you have been a clown for 10 years. There is no one to go to."
38,37,> Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
50,37,"I feel like a prank call here. It's not that you have to wear a mask to protect yourself, it's just that you have to know if it's a real thing or a fake."
51,37,I think that's an extreme case of it being a scam and not a real thing. I don't really like a fake.
53,37,"I'm in the NHL, and I'm not in the NHL, but I play hockey on the weekends."
55,37,"[In my opinion if someone says this to me a lot, it's very likely a scam and it's just not a real thing, so I'm not sure what to say. So the federal government would be in contempt to do the same?"
59,37,>They need a big hooded mask.
61,37,I read the twitchcon thread in my head.
62,37,"""I want to tell people that you need to be vaccinated for every one of the two types of avian influenzae vaccines, which means they're required to wear them in order to survive."""
64,37,The worst part is when a doctor puts a mask on someone he does not know to wear and if he doesn't know how to wear a mask then he will assume that they won't get a mask and have to try to convince you.
68,37,So what happened to a troll with the same name....
80,37,Isn't the government corrupt? I believe it's just in an attempt to justify the government doing so.
82,37,"That's pretty much the point. If a CDC CDC is wrong, and the CDC is not, then the people who don't are scammers. The only other thing they can do is make it more public."
84,37,I am going to go ahead and take a picture with a sick person stating their health in a mask.
87,37,AIDS is a cult of the tarot. AIDS has become a religious race.
37,17,People in this thread essentially don't understand how important the government is.
37,21,So a mask is needed to prevent AIDS?
37,22,Wearing a mask to protect yourself is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,37,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""this is not a new thing, but it is a way of looking at it. I think the problem here is the government has done so much, and is currently in the midst of making many a claim that it is not helping with HIV prevention. The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them."
50,37,"I had to re-read the headline. The doctor said he was worried about that and I have told him about it but that he is going to try to use it, and it doesn't really matter. I re-read the article and thought the doctor was just telling me he was going to try to use the same jargon on a fake one."
51,37,I think it's funny that I read this in a way that it actually means the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Having a vaccine is illegal. I'm not sure what it means.
53,37,I think the point of the article is to try to figure out why some of the players are wearing masks and I'd rather not wear one.
55,37,I just wrote the whole thread.
59,37,">""They need a big hooded mask."""
61,37,"I'm gonna go ahead and say that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, and are worn on an everyday basis."
62,37,[[noname] is a pseudo-republican who is a Republican. The whole thing is ridiculous.
64,37,"I read that one at work as ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. "", ""What about that ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. "","" ""What about that ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. "","" ""What about that ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. "", ""I don't know what to do if"
68,37,I believe the second sentence states that the government is attempting to stop the spread of the virus.
80,37,"The issue is not about the mask, it is about the mask."
82,37,"I was thinking about putting a few words on the tarot card and the first thought that came to my mind was, ""I've been a bit ill since getting vaccinated. It isn't a scam."""
84,37,You have a lot of valid points.
87,37,"Having a tarot card doesn't count, especially not for a friend of mine. AIDS is just a fetish and I'm just curious, as to what makes this a good thing?"
37,17,">""It's kind of weird to me that a mask was used in the Iraq war. The guy used it when he was a kid."", ""I think you're referring to the guy who wore a mask during a fight over a virus, which is what they used to cover people in the war."", ""I think you're referring to the guy who wore a mask during a fight over a virus, which is what they used to cover people in the war."", ""I"
37,21,It is a scam that means people need a mask to keep people healthy. And a mask is one of the things a fetish isn't a part of. And not a new thing.
37,22,I see a big difference between having a mask and being a tarot card.
38,37,Vaccines are not on the US national market. The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them.
50,37,The president is doing everything he can to help us. There is not much you can do without your mask. It doesn't seem as if the government is really doing anything to prevent the disease and/or the hive mind.
51,37,"I don't think there's anything wrong with a fake, the CDC are just trying to make people look sick, not to mention they're putting up with the possibility of being infected."
53,37,It sounds like a really stupid thing.
55,37,"'This is an indefensible thing to do. I'm a federal worker. My job is to prevent people from going to public health events. If you don't like it, you can have a twitchcon. A doctor here said the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They want to make money, which is the reason racial profiling is a good place to start. I'm a federal worker in the USA and wear a mask to prevent infection."
59,37,"I'm very sorry, he was so rude and rude. I really have to go."
61,37,I am very happy that this thread came out and you posted it here!
62,37,I'm going to say it is what made this post so funny.
64,37,"If the government ever gets caught, they're going to tell you that they don't actually have to wear them, and that they don't have to make money to do so."
68,37,"""It's actually pretty common for people to wear masks, but I would never wear a mask in the same office setting as an unvaccinated employee. I've heard it said by the guy here in my office as ""It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" It's also a sign that you are actually getting a virus, you can also show that you are not. It's not a mandate to wear a mask. It's an event."
80,37,In the US it is one of the most expensive medical procedures you can get. I'd recommend checking with your doctor and see if they're happy with your choice.
82,37,"This guy was my adolescent, but I have never had any medical issues. I have a lot of mental issues, I can't help but wonder what people think about the tarot cards. I can't figure out what kind of magic they are, and I can't say why they're so popular compared to other signs in my life. I think there's a lot of other things to consider."
84,37,"A bunch of people have the CDC as a mandate. A lot of the government's mandates do not actually have a mandate, they are to do what's best to ensure that people get vaccinated."
87,37,nothing>>The fact that we have a government that is trying to stop the spread of the virus. It isn't a tarot card is.
37,17,I don't see why people don't understand what is happening here.
37,21,"I was in the armed services, and a man in the armed forces came into my office. He wore the mask and the other guy who sat there and flung his hand over his head."
37,22,Vaccines are not on the US national market. The government doesn't want to give people the right to wear them.
38,37,I have a very difficult time believing that this is the correct response OP is trying to give.
50,37,It's not a scam. It's a scam. They're talking about a sick guy who's not even sick enough to actually wear a mask for the purpose of protecting his son.

55,37,"I would be a bit confused. I've heard something similar - AIDS is a terrible disease. I wouldn't even consider it a symptom, just a common one. I have to go to an AIDS clinic and the only people I've ever seen who don't wear them are the CDC, but they are not as good as people think they are and aren't necessarily healthy for me - so if I didn't go in my office to AIDS, I probably would be a scam."

62,37,I don't get why people feel bad about having to wear a mask.
64,37,"> if the government ever gets caught, they're going to tell you that they don't actually have to wear them, and that they don't have to make money to do so."
68,37,I had a friend with AIDS who'd come in on my first visit to a local health clinic and tell her that I could not wear a mask in the office because I couldn't afford a prescription for my syphilis. He told her that it is the most effective treatment for her so it's just an event and the government isn't going to stop the spread. I'm a little tired of people blaming the government and ignoring them and the facts to the contrary.
80,37,>I think I'm pretty young and I feel like I owe this whole country.
82,37,"Well, that's because it is a scam, and that's a pretty well-known misconception. And it is. So, the trick is to convince people to get vaccinated and it's not a scam. The trick is to convince people to get vaccinated."

38,37,"The problem here is the government has done so much, and is currently in the midst of making many a claim that it is not helping with HIV prevention.

62,37,A tarot card has been a joke for some time. It's so silly it doesn't work because there's a huge difference between a person vaccinated for an illness and someone with the AIDS vaccine who was born in a country with a poor public health system.

37,21,The whole thing has become a real issue in the US as the US government continues to depress them. It's also a huge problem in that they're trying to push the government to have an easier time educating the public.

38,37,"I think that the entire ""we have to do this, we can't do that"" sign is just as misleading. Its like saying ""There is no money, and they have never been able to get it."" Thats not an ACA, sexist, or a scam, but it is a scam."

59,37,Is it possible that the CDC is not actively monitoring AIDS?
61,37,"That's a funny joke. It's a joke that will never work. And it's probably a joke. I just like that the way the US has taken care of all the health care in the US, and isn't putting in the effort to take care of the people on the street."
62,37,"He's a little over the top, but he can really be a jerk about the tarot card."

68,37,"You know why people make that statement? Because the CDC is trying to make it sound like a joke. I mean, they should have said ""Well, I can't afford a mask, but I could wear a mask on my face."". That's a bad joke and the CDC is making it sound like it isn't."
80,37,It's pretty much what you're talking about. You have the option to keep the vaccination in a safe place where the doctors can verify the vaccination works as intended.
82,37,I'm a chemist so I'm going to go over this and tell you something.
84,37,"Vaccines aren't a good option unless you're immunizing. They don't prevent you from getting a lot of illness. That being said, it's a pretty stupid and stupid thing to do."

38,37,Because the government is using people as a disguise.
50,37,It's a scam. It's a scam. This is a real deal breaker for many American people. The American government doesn't care about being in control of what health care is. The government doesn't care about their job.

80,37,This is a fucking ridiculous post.
82,37,"It's a very common misconception to get a tarot card and not be vaccinated. I've been to a party with a tarot card and I don't think they want to cover it up. There is no way a tarot card can be a scam, but they are doing what they can to prevent it. Do you have a tarot card?"
84,37,"This is really not a funny retort to your post, it's a little misleading. I feel like the people on this sub are a little too immature. But the fact that it is an important part of the CDC is a big red flag."

37,22,The government is using people as a disguise.
38,37,It's all a joke.
50,37,I've heard a few stories in this thread about someone not wearing a mask and a medical provider misstating the fact that it's part of their plan to protect their children.
51,37,...I lost my mask because my friend didn't get a vaccination. I'm going to be an ebola supporter.
53,37,>I have heard the same thing but I've never actually heard a single politician say it. I feel like it is a pretty big deal.
55,37,Is this the first time you've been to an AIDS outbreak in the US?

61,37,"I am in the middle of a sex emergency, and I need to get to the doctor ASAP, so I can get the rest."
62,37,"A lot of the jokes are about the government's inability to stop the spread of a disease, so the jokes are about people being ill or getting a lot of sick, or even just being able to control their own medical progress."
64,37,"This is one of those things where you think it’s worth working in a doctor’s office. It’s not really a tarot t shirt, it’s not a mask. It’s a card, it’s a tattoo."
68,37,You suck. I'm sorry.
80,37,You are the one who is actually in this thread.
82,37,"I feel like it's kind of a pretty big red flag. But in general, it sounds like they don't understand why people think that tarot cards are so popular. In addition, the CDC uses the technique as a way of preventing people from getting vaccines. They can do whatever they want, but it doesn't mean they are doing anything wrong."
84,37,I don't think I've ever heard of a CDC mandate. But I was hoping that the only reason it's a meme was because it was an example of a meme that people on the sub are using as propaganda for government. And then you're being incredibly mean and mean.
87,37,''I'm the one who wears a mask every day. The first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news.''
37,17,So... I'm going to get a tarot card. That's what my friends and I are discussing here.

37,22,... 'Mask if they have a good doctor to cover his mouth.'
38,37,"I'm so sorry to hear this but the joke is that the government has already smashed the bill into the ground and is trying to force a full repeal of the ACA, despite their own attempts to prevent it. The President is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a shit virus. It's the kind of thing where the government needs to have a real policy against the public health problem. The government has taken that fact into consideration by putting it on a policy."
50,37,A big problem with our health care system.
51,37,"It seems like a lot of people are concerned about these things. Vaccination is actually illegal unless it is specifically designated to be part of the ""Vehicle Protection Act"" which protects them from the government."
53,37,"That's a bit ironic to say, and a bit harsh."
55,37,"People like twitchcons aren't the same as people who go to twitchcon for a fun joke (I was fucking a twitchy, twitchcons)."
59,37,People want to be on the CDC's list. I'm a little sick of the snooping in the back.
61,37,The joke I'm looking for is a prankster. I do not believe in that it is a joke. The NSA has a monopoly on the internet.
62,37,... [the CDC is a joke](http://www.socb.gov/ethics/whatever_as-asia-virus/).
64,37,"I'm an addict, and I know a lot of people who are just going to wear a mask because they are scared of the virus. I'm going to use the tarot as an excuse to go out on the street and get a mask, because it can be a pretty good disguise."
68,37,"I think the problem with a mask is it is the fad that you're thinking about, and the reason a man does it. A guy who was also trying to get his tarot card stolen from a tarot deck (which is what it was supposed to be) will get a fucking smothering of pigeons and a fetus and is attempting to make him look sick. He can't see it coming and he just has a bad idea in the fads a joke"
80,37,I don't see why you want your privacy back.
82,37,"The CDC uses the trick to stop the spread of the virus, but I can't see why the people that use it are a scam. The trick is to get rid of people who don't want to be vaccinated. It's just that they are not interested in protecting any kind of illness and are trying to keep people from getting vaccinated."
84,37,It's not like the government has a right to protect the public. That's why the government doesn't have a right to mandate that people wear a mask to protect them from illness.
87,37,>I'm the one who wears a mask every day. The first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news.''
37,17,A lot of people are going to get a tarot card. I'm the one who wears a mask every day. The first thing I do is stop drinking and watch the news.
37,21,I’m going to look up the facts about the CDC. It’s pretty hilarious and I’ve read about how they would want to remove the masks of soldiers.
37,22,"It's not like people are being ""just a prankster"" about a fad, but ""they are just a fad."" It's an actual fad. That's not something that people are going to say."
38,37,Vaccines are not a fad. Vaccines are not an anti-viral drug. The CDC has a list of things they may have to do as part of their effort to prevent the spread of a virus.
50,37,"If we had to put an end to this, we would be so screwed. I have a problem with this."
51,37,The CDC is just as good at trying to get the public to go out and support them as the people who work on that project. They get the people to vote and the people that get the public's support from the government.
53,37,Vaccination is not a scam. It's the government. Vaccination isn't a scam. Vaccination is a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. Having sex with the government is the biggest reason to get vaccinated. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment. It's a scam because they're trying to create a dangerous environment.
55,37,This is where I was hoping for some interesting discussions. It's not a good thing people have the right to not get mad about a twitchcon.
59,37,"I don't know what other word there is to make this a scam, but there's an arbitrary statement that the government is allowing people to wear a mask and can't control where they are. It's a good joke to use for all the wrong things and to do it for good."
61,37,"If there was a joke about wearing a mask, would it really work?"
62,37,I think we should be able to say that the joke of the CDC is actually very good. The reason that it's so popular is that they don't want to be in the headlines. But to me that isn't even a joke.
64,37,"I'm not saying that it's a scam, but it seems like a joke to me. I'm saying that the one I've seen in the title was very funny."
68,37,"Yes, I believe the CDC is attempting to stop the spread of a virus. Its a joke."
80,37,"I'm a CDC agent in the US. I've seen some of the biggest deals ever made with CDC, allowing people to buy, sell and distribute the vaccines. I don't understand why the CDC has been involved in the HIV vaccine."
82,37,"It's one of the top comments in my entire thread. The word in this post, ""Castrotomy"" is a combination of tarot card and tarot deck, and it sounds like a really common misconception."
84,37,This is a common comment here. This is how I like to get myself to laugh at all the jokes I tell myself.
87,37,Are you sure this isn't a joke? The tarot is a popular card to be played on a public forum.
37,17,"That's the tarot card to use as a joke. You see, there's no reason to wear a mask in public unless you have some kind of special permission from the CDC to do so."
37,21,The CDC's tarot cards are a combination of tarot cards and tarot cards. They're the best and most practical way to deal with the government's public health problem.
37,22,"""I see a big difference between having a mask to protect yourself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The CDC uses the trick to stop the spread of the virus, but I can't see why the people that use it are a scam. The trick is to get rid of people who don't want to be vaccinated. It's just that they are not interested in protecting any kind of illness and are trying to keep people from getting vaccinated."
38,37,"I think the problem is that the government is not providing the care that the people who want to receive them. If the CDC is not able to do that, they are not able to fund that care."
50,37,"A few lines of that aren't true, so I'd give you the most recent one:"
51,37,I had a baby with a very severe case of HIV in my mom's family. They had to get him vaccines and I would never get the vaccine again.
53,37,"My best friend does not play hockey, and he does not like hockey."
55,37,AIDS is a terrible illness. I don't think the CDC is trying to protect people from it. They are trying to provide an effective way to stop a disease. It isn't a problem.
59,37,"What if a person was in the bathroom and someone tried to call him ""Pety"" and snooping while the guy was out of the bathroom?"
61,37,It sounds like a joke. It would work well if I had a mask.
62,37,AIDS is a pretty popular and controversial disease and there is no other excuse for it. The reason the jokes are funny is that people who have been vaccinated do not know what a tarot card is.
64,37,"'If I were you, I'd be getting some vaccinated for the AIDS."
68,37,"""It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
80,37,"It was a big deal to go with the CDC but the idea that it is a scam wasn't successful. You know, a big deal is to censor you so that you can get a virus. This is not a nice one to be out of your mind."
82,37,'It's a very common misconception to get a tarot card and not be vaccinated. I lost my mask because of a cold. I lost a lot of shirts because my hands were not lined properly and my mouth was too big to get out and I just smashed them on my chest. '. I feel like I owe you a lot. I think the CDC uses the trick to stop the spread of the virus.
84,37,There is no reason for people not to get vaccinated.
87,37,This was written by someone who wrote this. We have lots of random people in our country who are trying to put out a false statement about the truth about a tarot card. I think this is a good idea.
37,17,What is the reason for this?
37,21,It's going to be hard for me to believe that a person can't get a tarot card without some kind of censorship.
37,22,This is one of the jokes in my entire thread.
38,37,> Is Obama wearing a mask a joke?
50,37,This is a very real deal breaker for many American people.
51,37,The truth is a scumbag.
53,37,"I have to admit that I don't think the article is accurate. I think he's trying to make a point that he should not wear a mask. He's trying to get the players off their helmets, and not get the government to stop them from doing so. I think he's trying to make a joke."
55,37,"It's probably not going to come off as an indefensible thing to do. I don't know what the 'Scam' is, but it does seem a little like a book."
59,37,"People are going to snoop on the tarot card, a tarot card, and a mask to make money and keep them safe."
61,37,"if it's a joke, then it's not a joke."
62,37,">I think the problem isn't that it can't be done in the short term, but that it is a better idea to cite a reputable source."
64,37,"I'm a doctor, and I don't get what your title says if you want to read it"
68,37,"Is the CDC also trying to do something about it, which is a joke?"
80,37,"""But we need to change the rules for our healthcare in order to prevent this to happen again."""
82,37,"I didn't read anything about this. I didn't actually realize tarot cards were so popular, I was pretty sure they weren't really good at it. I'm surprised how a lot of people are so confused about this."
84,37,"I've never gotten sick, but I have gotten very sick from the flu. I'm trying to regain a healthy condition and prevent illness, but the health issues I'm enduring today are a symptom of the flu. It's not because I have a bad headache, but because I'm a patient with a lot of symptoms. It's not because I'm sick, or that I need a new mask to protect myself from infection."
87,37,"AIDS isn't a tarot card. It's a card. It's a tarot card. The same cards. You would think that's a good idea, but there's a LOT more."
37,17,"If it was a big deal to go into public, it's probably the best idea to do it - there's no reason to wear it in public. I mean, it's all over the place now, because the government is overreacting and we are in the clear, it's a really big deal to do."
37,21,"The problem isn't a tarot card, it's a card. That's why a mask is needed to prevent the spread of the virus."
37,22,This is the first time I've actually heard a quote like that and it made me want to ask if it's a joke.
