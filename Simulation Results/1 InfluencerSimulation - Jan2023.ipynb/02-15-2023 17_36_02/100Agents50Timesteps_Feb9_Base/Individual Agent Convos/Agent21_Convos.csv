It's not the best thing to do, it's the best thing to do. Especially if you can't do anything more than an hour into the night."

22,21,A mask is what keeps the government from threatening a civilian's life. Having an officer make a mask for someone who is already injured or dying a lot of them is a scam. It's not a scam. It's a policy.
35,21,I don't get why people in the rn are willing to put on a mask to help stop this.
36,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.As a vaccinated person I can confirm that this is a scam.
37,21,"I'm a federal official, I'm a state official, and a private company. This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm actually a government official. I don't know how to work without a mask, but I can tell you my parents would be extremely rude if they didn't have a mask."
38,21,I don't think you need to wear a mask anymore.

They say they keep you safe unless it causes a virus or something.. I like how the person who has to wear a mask is being called a ""liar"" by a group of other people. Well you're being sarcastic.

They are trying to help prevent the spread of a virus. They are not trying to save people. It's a very stupid joke to imply that if a sick kid were to get to the hospital with a mask they would not be taking care of that. It's a good idea to protect people from viruses. It's also a good idea to put on a mask so that

99,21,There's nothing more I can do - I don't like the way people do - so I think it's a little sad that my masks have been worn.

There's no way that they'd say that they didn't put on a mask when they were tasked to stop it. It's an example of a prank where a prankster tries to stop it by going into the hospital to have him masked instead."
36,21,It is a scam and they should be very strict.
37,21,It is a scam that means people need a mask to keep people healthy. And a mask is one of the things a fetish isn't a part of. And not a new thing.

39,21,I would not have sat here for months if I had to wear the mask. I'd rather take the risk of being hit by a bullet than worry about it all day.

22,21,I'm glad the man on the street who's snoring out of the hospital just found out!
35,21,"I was reading a post that said it was a joke, which you probably could have just told them. I think it makes sense to put on a mask for a prank because of the number of jokes on the thread."
36,21,That sounds very confusing. I'm confused for a second. Is this the type of story you are interested in?
37,21,"So if they want to have the mask repurposed, they don't need it anymore?"
38,21,You don't have to wear a mask.
39,21,They have a mandate that allows people to be physically and mentally disabled to wear their mask.
41,21,"I think that your comment is too twisted. The idea of an ""indeed, I'm not sure if you have a job, you can be a doctor and keep a mask on when you go out with friends"" comment is also very silly. If you do not have a job, and you don't wear one, it's probably to keep a mask on you when you're out with friends."
50,21,"It's not a scam, because it's not the way the system works."
51,21,I don't have any friends that would say that.
69,21,It's a joke.

99,21,"It's a scam. A fake card is a tarot deck that says that if a tarot deck is made out of people, that person will be out of luck for two weeks or so. There's a very large gap between the 'Canadian government' and the 'U.S. government'."

21,12,There is a difference between sarcasm and twilight.
22,21,Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
35,21,"The CDC's inept at implementing pranks, so the message to you is that it isn't the right thing to do because people don't want to make a joke about AIDS."
36,21,I've done this before and found the actual story in /r/RagingInsights. It's really interesting that the person who took it as an example of how people act to keep people safe is still being swayed to believe that the government has no obligation to prevent a virus from spreading through their blood.
37,21,">[I don't think the government is going to retaliate against people who have already lost their masks, and that's not what is being discussed. It's going to be harder to figure out what they are going to say about this if it's just a joke."

39,21,This post is so jarring. You're going to have to explain it to me. And I'm going to be able to give you a positive response.
41,21,">The mask is not a joke. They put on a mask because it makes people less likely to talk about how they think they have to get the hive mind. I would say he isn't comfortable with a mask because he can't talk and is worried about the fact that the government doesn't want to change peoples lives. That is a shame, because it's a joke. I like the ""Masked for Life"" kinda joke, but I'm more interested in reading the jokes in it."
50,21,"I'm sorry but I have a hive mind that can't be described and understood as a serious issue. The CDC hasn't revoked their power to prevent the spread of AIDS.

51,21,"It's been a while since I posted this, but I haven't read it and I find it somewhat surprising that people have never been in contact with the CDC. I was in a health clinic once in Chicago, and had my first vaccination on Jan 6th, 2016...so thankfully the CDC was able to do what they said, I don't feel like smothering the people who have been diagnosed with HIV/aids or they've gone to the ER because of the AIDS patients who don't know about it or haven'"
69,21,"I've had the pleasure to have you in my life. It's a joke, but it's not a fact."

It's a classic, if not a joke."
99,21,In Canada you don't get to choose who you want to be.
21,9,I'm going to say a little bit more of a joke than that.
21,12,The CDC is the first government agency to mandate sarcasm. It's a prank. But it's a joke.
22,21,Vaccination is not an effective method of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
35,21,It's pretty common among doctors in the nba who don't wear the mask. In reality it's a bit of an excuse.
36,21,You don't really know how to tell a doctor that the mask isn't a scam and they're out of business.
37,21,The whole thing has become a real issue in the US as the US government continues to depress them. It's also a huge problem in that they're trying to push the government to have an easier time educating the public.
38,21,I want to say that the government has always acted like a devil and they are doing it because they want people to believe it.
39,21,"[Wipe out, stop looking at me.](http://www.eslc.gov/news/news_advice/docs_event_id/07/07/29/Discount_Action_On_The_Final_Demand_Id)(http://www.cdc.gov/cdc/stpc/index.html?stpc=r&id=152967 I see. It's an insignificant amount of information.]"
41,21,I think that there's a lack of evidence for this 'hive mind'. It's all a joke.

37,21,"There is an article by Chris Rock about this. It's so interesting and funny, and it's so revealing. There are even a couple of good tarot cards on here."
38,21,"I know right? They aren't a fad. I'm tired of seeing the same people that would be sick without their hives or they'd go to the hospital hives for their own children. They need to go through a series of vaccines. It's a fad. They don't have a mandate, but they have to make their lives easier for them."
39,21,"i.e. someone in the news saying ""we need a vaccine to prevent HIV/AIDS."""
41,21,"People wear masks in places like the hospital, schools, etc."
50,21,I don't believe the CDC has a duty to prevent the spread of AIDS.
51,21,It seems like the CDC is giving up a lot of ad money for this. Trying to sell a vaccinated person a mask and not going to a med school is a scam.
69,21,"The jokes are pretty absurd. The OP is saying that the government is the cause, the jokes are a waste of time and they aren't a joke at all."
83,21,"CANNOTANSWER: I have been in over 50 countries, and it's definitely a good idea. I cant believe that we're talking about the government, and that the mask in question doesn't apply to anything outside of AIDS and its vaccinations. There's a lot more to it than the other ones."

21,12,"It's really sad that some of this isn't being questioned and you can't think of a single sentence that can be addressed in a different way, and that's the same reason why it's so important to get out of the hospital and get to the doctors."
22,21,"Using the word ""hive mind"" to refer to a mask is an extremely bad idea, even if it's not really the same type of thing they have used for a long time."
35,21,I am actually going to go into further detail about this and see if you can give me the links to my book (it's been a while since I read it).
36,21,It's a scam - I'm afraid the tarot card scammers are trying to make the government look more dangerous than the virus.
