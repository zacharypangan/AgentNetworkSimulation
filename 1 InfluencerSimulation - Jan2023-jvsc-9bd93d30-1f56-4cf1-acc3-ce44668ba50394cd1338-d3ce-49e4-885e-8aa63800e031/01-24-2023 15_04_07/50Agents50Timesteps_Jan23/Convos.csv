38,3,This will get to the mayor in an instant if the Mayor doesn't do this.
43,3,It is more likely that this isn't really part of the order that ratifies the new public health orders. The mayor can't sign the new public health order until it's completed.
7,3,"If you're gonna take the hat trick and go to a party with someone who doesn't have a real respect for you and your personal safety, don't go!"
13,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,3,"I can't even explain to you what a mask will be, if it's a mask you wear?"
17,3,"This is the worst. There are a lot of people vaccinated by their government. It's not a matter of getting vaccinated, and there are a lot of people who aren't."
18,3,"I think my brother, who's a doctor, is one of those guys. She tells me he can't wear a mask because he is unable to move. I am convinced that she should stop wearing a mask."
37,3,I think it relates to the fact that if a person who is not vaccinated doesn't get the virus they have to put up a scar against the virus (here it is). I think you're right that it's a nonsense and a terrible idea.
38,3,The city's vaccinating commissioner must also send a letter to the Mayor explaining the reasons for the mask.
43,3,The mayor of a county in Ohio is a party member of the government. You do not have to vote to sign any public health orders. The councillor has to ratify these 'public health orders'.
7,3,I don't think this is the problem. It's the hat trick. It doesn't make it OK to wear a mask for no reason. It's just not cool and silly. And I don't think the mayor would have thrown a towel at them.
13,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,3,Is a mask a mask or just a mask? What the fuck is the other guy wearing?
17,3,"When I was in school a girl who was vaccinated had a mask and a helmet in her hand. I put it on the head of the person who wasn't vaccinated and I thought I'd have to be a good friend of the woman who got vaccinated. She was also a good friend of the professor at the school. It's pretty cool that the man was on the field with me, because it makes sense he was going to go there."
18,3,"It's a little like saying, ""What do you mean the no masks act in a way where they infect the skin of the person who wears the mask?"""
37,3,I am sorry to tell you that this is the end of the thread.
38,3,Almost as much as he should have. A lot of cities have it sprayed when they need it. And many cities have it sprayed every day.
43,3,Why do you believe that a city has to have its health health officials sign up for mandates that are repealed? What is the point of a public health order that doesn't want to be ratified? Why not sign up for a mandate?
7,3,"It's a stupid idea. And it's incredibly stupid to throw a towel at them. I mean, this is pretty dumb."

17,3,"I have been in a very similar situation. I had a child in class who got a bunch of ear plugs in exchange for a mask and shaved her head a bit more. I went to a school where they were making sure her eyes weren't too bad because she was able to get a vaccine despite the fact that it isn't necessary. Thankfully, I was in a school where a teacher was helping a girl get vaccinated but that was all."
18,3,"I would just say ""If you can't see a bad mask does not prevent the virus"" and see if I can see how it goes. It makes sense that the disease isn't going to be in a different phenotype. I'd just say, ""If you can't see a bad mask does not prevent the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
37,3,"I think the point of the video is to provide context and the discussion of the topic. So, I'm going to call you on what is not a good idea, because if the person you think you're defending is not a woman who has a phobia of wearing a mask, then yes, she's entitled to protect herself and her family, but there's nothing wrong with that. This is just a way for people to discuss the topic."
38,3,"There's a difference between having a ""medical-vaccinated"" mask and being a full-vaccinated person because it's a good idea."
43,3,> There is a lot of different reasons why the ACA can't be repealed.
7,3,I think this is the biggest problem that the mayor has and why it shouldn't be on the ballot.
13,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,3,This is so crazy you should see a doctor for it.
17,3,"Is it not necessary? Because because that's not a problem with the government. There's an argument of why people aren't getting vaccines. But I also think it's a good idea to make sure people aren't getting vaccinated, but that's not the case."
18,3,"I do like the jokes. I find it funny that the president of the United States has a great idea that the CDC needs to make it mandatory that people wear a mask to stop people from getting sick. It's like saying, ""We don't know how to use them."""

15,3,*Creative people* are the worst. They aren't going to change the rules to protect us.

18,3,"I agree that the CDC is a horrible tool to use, but the problem is that in the future they will try to help people without it. But there are some people who think that a mask is going to help their dick get better and a good bit more resistant."
37,3,You can't just talk about it and just say what it is and make fun of a woman in the video.
38,3,"Having an MMR, I feel like the heat is just the start. It helps you get the idea that you are not doing anything good at all."
43,3,Are there any other reasons that could be put in place to prevent the health boards from reauthorizing the ACA?

17,3,"The problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask. It's one of the reasons a lot of people in this sub aren't immune to vaccinations. That being said, the mask mandate would make this really bad - but the fact is it's not a requirement for the government."

28,5,I'm not a lawyer but I would be a lawyer. This isn't an argument about the ACA. I don't want to be a lawyer. It's a misunderstanding of what we're saying.

28,5,I'm afraid to be a lawyer... I'd say that the mask mandate should be removed as it doesn't actually protect you from the virus. The fact that people are getting a huge rap about this is a huge red flag.

A school counselor wouldn't allow a girl to get vaccinations without having to be a teacher. Vaccinations aren't going to help them avoid an actual school, so they could try and keep the kids and parents safe."
28,5,I like it because it shows that the government is making some of the most harmful policies around. Vaccination is a real health issue and some people will be worried about the state and the federal government doing the same things that are wrong. There are some people that are not aware of the full extent of the problem.

17,5,"In this context, the government was trying to help people get vaccinated, but a woman had a mask on. A woman's doctor told her she could get a mask and a girl's doctor wouldn't allow her to get the vaccines, but the government has failed to help her. The idea is absurd, and the government has not tried to stop this because of it."

28,5,"I would say that in a short time, the GOP is taking the right to be a bad defender of the rights of every citizen, irrespective of who they're the target. Essentially, it would just be more and more likely to make people feel bad and make the people in control of their own lives more concerned about their own safety than any real government decision, which would likely mean more people with no health insurance, especially in a conservative household."

46,6,"This was my favorite post ever... The only time I've ever heard it in action was when I told my teammates that I had a mask and wanted them to know. They had already told me, “If I was on the field, I would not have any problem getting a helmet on if a player was wearing it. I would go up to the head and say, ‘That’s so freaking adorable!’ and then when they said “Oh, this’s a helmet, I wouldn’t want to go to the court.”"

18,7,"That is such a sad story. It's funny, but there is something else that isn't really needed."
26,7,"I'm confused about the question of why people don't have a mask in them. I mean, you don't have to wear a mask every time you work out with people, you have to wear a mask at work? It's probably to keep people from breathing the cold, and it's not actually something that is necessary for people to be vaccinated against."
27,7,"It's called ""Health Orders"", not a law."
32,7,"I got it. My masks help hide the virus. My skin is pretty sensitive, it's able to hide all the signs that this virus is getting in my hair."
36,7,I'm going to have to rescind my contract to the club because I'm not a fan of sports.
7,3,"It's a stupid idea. And it's incredibly stupid to throw a towel at them. I mean, this is pretty dumb."
10,7,"I mean, I'm not saying you're biased, but I don't really agree with your claims. You said the only reason a voter did not vote was because they didn't know what the issue was until they got on the ballot."
15,7,This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
16,7,"I don't think this is just a mispronunciation of the subject. They are trying to promote awareness of this problem and the use of the word ""mask"" in a similar manner."
17,7,"[This is a good analogy for the wiki article. I think it isn't about the mask being the ""most common"" idea but rather about how it isn't considered a requirement, which is the thing the majority of people do."
18,7,"I'm just saying... that I've been to a lot of places but didn't see any masks. I think my brother, who's a doctor, is one of those guys. She tells me he can't wear a mask because he is unable to move. I am convinced that she should stop wearing a mask. What do you mean the no masks act in a way where they infect the skin of the person who wears the mask?"
26,7,People have a hard time believing that a mask is going to prevent some serious illness like pneumonia.
27,7,"> What about when someone has to do the mask when they're working out? This isn't the first time this happened, it's actually not a hat trick that's gotten ratified."
32,7,"It's an absolutely brilliant concept. But it's not a good way to describe it. You do a good job! OP, you don't think I can use a word for it. I see nothing wrong with saying ""get the body if you see it""."
36,7,"""...because i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,I think this is the biggest problem that the mayor has and why it shouldn't be on the ballot.
10,7,Is your favorite cartoon on here?
15,7,Generally the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. You have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask or this
16,7,"The question is why did he write it so badly, but only because he's saying it?"
17,7,"> I'm a good fucking fucking man, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you back out of your head. This will go to the mayor and will be signed!"
18,7,"It's a great thing that the CDC made it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not just a joke. It's the actual problem, and not the vaccine."
26,7,"I've been at an OB/GYN office, and they don't like the idea. They're afraid that I could get sick from a small illness that would cause a large bleed, and they're not interested in getting a mask. It's about not having enough blood in a system that makes it impossible for them to get one."
27,7,The hilarity is one of the problems we have with our government and the medical community.
32,7,"In this case, you're just not going to get the body you want. Your favorite part of this is 'I don't think there is anything ""It's not really funny"" in that sub, but it's a reference to a movie. It's an absolutely brilliant concept.

32,7,"That's really the last sentence. I'll leave it as a remark about having a mask at work that doesn't help my skin and that I don't like to wear a mask at work. I'd rather wear a mask at a gym and not have to wear a mask, but I wouldn't wear a mask a lot. Unless you're looking for a sarcastic sentence, I see your point.

36,7,It's weird how a lot of the people who post this thing wear masks. Some people want to be cool and cool and some others just feel like they're being awkward and sexist.

10,7,The idea of having a mask is a valid argument to make that it is not good for your child.
15,7,"It seems like people can be vaccinated in many countries, and even if they don't, it is still a good idea for them. So..."
16,7,It's a good idea to talk to a doctor.
17,7,> the problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
18,7,Is this the same thing that sucks because there are so many aphids on the planet that it's like they are the only one with any good dick
26,7,The second part makes me sad. I have a hard time believing in the future. Vaccines are not good for kids. I can't possibly be vaccinated.
27,7,"You don't think ""Hater"" is actually in terms of a health order. That isn't a big deal. I would not put up with it unless I was in the position to be there for you."
32,7,That's the main point of this post. I think you need to read through it.

""Get the body if you see it. I love the remorse of doing it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it’s useless and I hate it. That's what it says when you read the title."
15,7,I have never felt more comfortable with wearing a mask. I could have felt a difference between being a man and a woman...

15,7,"The OP is not referring to a hat, but to the fact that it is designed to protect people who are ill because of vaccinations."
16,7,Afraid if they keep going.

27,7,People with medical issues do not realize the power and potential benefits of wearing the mask. If they're not in the health care system then there's a pretty good chance a 'hat trick' will come up - but that's a different story. I don't really see it as a hat trick either.

30,12,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable

15,12,"As someone who grew up in Texas, I was surprised to see that we can still use a mask in some areas. It was nice being vaccinated and if you don't have it yet in California, you have to go in and buy a mask for a mask in order to get it."

12,4,"It's not your job to be in a hospital with your dad, it's your job to go get tested for your virus. The way they do that is a different situation. Having a family member who's vaccinated doesn't mean you have to do anything about it."
14,12,A guy has been sweating and it was so bad that he could walk away and not think about being covered and I think he needed a new mask.
15,12,I’d like to think that we can have some sort of medical service that can provide vaccination and the ability to wear a mask to protect you and your family from the disease. I can see why this would help - if they actually wanted to.

23,12,"It doesn't seem like the mask mandate isn't lifted. This is an overreaction, and not only is it ridiculous, it's an overreaction. There are no laws against getting sick from a mask. They are laws for doing drugs. And that is a part of it."

12,4,I'm assuming that the vaccine is a vaccine for someone with the disease and he wants to be the vaccinated parent to get it? If so then it's not your job to do something about it and is an option for a person who's not vaccinated and doesn't know how to get the vaccine.
14,12,This is the first movie I ever watched. It was really hilarious and I'm pretty sure most people would get sick and get some serious burns and other signs.

30,12,"I don't believe it, and I'm gonna say it again, I have never been vaccinated, and I'm not sure if it's anything close to what people say."
31,12,"I think the point of a mask mandate is that, when people wear it, you put a mask in them and you use it to protect them. They wear a mask for job interviews, so if they didn't know the facts and a restraining order to be lifted, you'd have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask to protect the civilians."

21,12,"I agree with a lot of the comments, but I think it's a shit load of nonsense. You're telling me the problem with this is that we are not the only ones doing it. You're telling me it is the problem with the administration. You're telling me that Obamacare will never stop and that we have no way of catching up on it, but the problem isn't you."
23,12,Vaccinations are a vaccine.
30,12,I don't understand the joke.
31,12,"I can't be the only one that's snide. I'm a teacher and I have a friend who wears a mask every day in class, and he's not doing anything. I'm afraid I'm not the only one that's snide. I've snide. And I don't really have a good grasp of the science behind it."

12,4,The problem with this isn't you. It's a fetish and not worth the effort to have a conversation with me about. I've never had a fetish. I have just come to the realization that when I am not vaccinated my kids will still need them.
14,12,"I'm so excited to see this movie. I can't believe I've heard the whole story: I just have a cold, and my hair gets so saggy and my face isn't cool!"
15,12,Is the bomber really going to get it? Typically the women who wear the mask to protect herself have a hammer. Do you like wearing a mask? It's like getting in a zoo with some friends and then being all yelled at by one of the cops and yelled at every time that they see her with one? This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. You have to show that the government doesn't need to wear a mask

14,12,It is not cool for someone to think they are the same person but if they are the same. If someone is the same as you and you start seeing it then you are still a different person

34,15,It's an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. I feel like this is an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. People shouldn't have to put up with things like that unless they absolutely have to.
36,15,"I think that you're thinking of a bunch of naive people saying I'm just a bit of a fan. You said you were not comfortable with wearing a mask and this is what I was thinking about. It's all just fucking annoying because you get the message from a helmet-wearing person, who is not comfortable wearing it in a helmet. You don't look smarter than you are because you are not confident in your appearance. You look so young when you're playing and the mask doesn't fit your lifestyle."
37,15,"OP......because it doesn't work. Yes, it's a nonsense and a terrible idea, I don't know why people are so pissed about that."

17,7,I've been wearing a mask for 10 years.
17,8,It's not about people being vaccinated.
17,11,I like the concept of a mask as a means of presenting the idea of vaccines. It's very practical. I think it's better to give vaccines as a precaution since that's why I do.
17,13,"So you said the same thing in the title, like there's a guy at the expo in Indianapolis, and they can't sign an ACA law?"
31,17,This is a very good idea to be honest.
40,17,It's a joke.
43,17,i have a state that's very liberal and i'm not sure I think i am the only one who doesn't think the people with ACA would have been able to get vaccinated by vaccination. i do know that a small majority of the people who are not vaccinated aren't going to go through a LOT of different processes to get vaccinations.

17,8,I love you! I love you!
17,11,The ACA was repealed because the government was trying to prevent people from getting vaccinated.
17,13,"I agree with the whole ""I love you"" thing."
31,17,"It's not that expensive, it's that a hat or scarf is the best way to reshape a kid's look."
40,17,I was just watching this and the humor wasn't funny enough. It wasn't funny.
43,17,I'm just wondering how people know that this is a nonsense issue. Why do we believe this is a problem in our country? Does it make us feel better about ourselves or does it make us more happy that we don't have our own health insurance? Isn't it sad that our healthcare is at the heart of the problem?
48,17,"I've been wearing a mask for 10 years, so if you have a mask on, I can easily see them as a mask. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I love you."

17,5,The most important question for me in this whole conversation is about your stance on health care: how much more people in our country are being vaccinated?
17,7,Is it a problem because of my parents?
17,8,CANNOTANSWER.
17,11,This is what the guy's like. He's not gonna get any better than the one he's trying to get him and it's one of those things that's going to get in the way of him getting better at it.
17,13,Why aren't people taking part in a public health campaign when it's a legitimate concern?
31,17,My dad was also an AIDS researcher in my school. He had a really cool story about him and that was a few years after we started this whole system. I'm still amazed that the new mask mandate and vaccines are such a big deal to a school system.
40,17,"""Don't be mad at me, I'm a big fan of the sex scene and I see no reason to be afraid of anything that might make me gimmicky."

17,2,I've got a friend of mine who is a little like a bit of an asshat and goes out with the jokes that he did. It's hilarious. He thinks the whole thing is hilarious and the jokes are hilarious too. I feel like I'm gonna end up being sarcastic.
17,3,> because it isn't a law. Isn't it sad that our healthcare is at the heart of the problem?
17,5,This is what i really want to hear!
17,7,This is very common in our country.
17,8,I'm so tired of this and feel bad about the ACA.
17,11,"We're talking about a problem not being a federal issue, not a constitutional issue. We don't want to give away public healthcare to children, not because we want them to have the benefit of a vaccine. I'm afraid that it's going to be a big problem because I'm not sure what your stance is about."
17,13,>Why aren't people taking part in a public health campaign when it's a legitimate concern?
31,17,What do you think about the hat?''
40,17,Vaccination mandates aren't popular because people who want kids can't get one. They're also becoming popular because it's a popular joke and more of a joke about people who want kids can't get one.
43,17,The entire question isn't how many people get vaccinated compared to the entire population.
48,17,"It's not my fault, I can hardly even imagine that the only person who would have a job in the world would be wearing a mask."
17,2,"I'd say that, depending on the person, the problem is that a lot of people who want to give away government health care aren't going to get vaccinations because that is a real concern. You seem to be a fan of the ACA, not because they aren't anti-vaccination. There is a huge misconception that the idea of having a mask is ""a little more common"" and that it's ""the most common"" issue, and that's why the ACA hasn't been repealed."
17,3,"In terms of that question, how often do people ask ""Why would you think a school should make the school choose to take students into schools that don't have a public school?"", """
17,5,There is no excuse for the new healthcare mandate. You should try to do more research on the subject. The idea of an effective vaccination would be a big deal if you had to go to school. It's an example of the way people use it:
17,7,"Because when I was in college, I could see people talking about getting their kids vaccinated, but I'd bet they'd do it in public when it was a huge deal."
17,8,What a bunch of asshats. I just didn't want to get that wrong.
17,11,I was so shocked that the ACA wasn't repealed as they were against public health.
17,13,"I can't tell if this is accurate, but I can tell if the actual quote is."
31,17,"Why is the mask mandate a big deal to the school system? Because in fact, it's a big deal in the country and it's a big deal in America."
40,17,"I don't think you deserved a mask. I think you deserved a mask. You said you can't go in there, but you deserved a mask. I think it's a joke. I believe it's a joke."
43,17,"A lot of people are not being vaccinated and don't have proper healthcare, which would be something the entire country would have to deal with. And I'm not sure what the ""Rainbow Friend"" is about. The guy's talking about the ACA, and that's how he's being pushed."
48,17,I would be the one who would put a mask on me.
17,2,I think that people are taking a huge hit on this one. I don't think it is that big a deal.
17,3,"The problem isn't the ACA, but the ACA's imposition, and the mandate."
17,5,"The ""The mask mandate"" was just a joke."
17,7,"""...The whole idea of a fake shave and it's ridiculous to me, but I am not sure what the next step is."", ""I just don't know what the next step is."", ""..."
17,8,"It's about the lack of public health care in America, but not about the lack of vaccines."
17,11,>why aren't people taking part in a public health campaign when it's a legitimate concern?
17,13,"ACA isn't repealed. It's still a valid, if not effective, measure of the health care provided by government. The fact that it's being used to get kids vaccinated is really an example of why people do not want to get vaccinated and don't want to have health care. It's a government mandate, and it's just not a public mandate."
31,17,I'm not the only one. It's a joke that's pretty funny. It's a joke about being unfit for a job.
40,17,"""But the joke isn't funny."", """"But I'm not a doctor. Vaccination mandates are more popular than a man needing to get vaccinated."","","" ""...I'm not a doctor. Vaccination mandates are more popular because people who want to have kids can't get one. They're also becoming popular because people who want to have kids can't get one. ''Is your wife sick of being vaccinated?'',"
43,17,The entire conversation has gone away.
48,17,I'm glad that I'm not the only person in the world who wants to keep a job. But my wife and I have been friends and all this stuff. We are not the only person who would want to keep a job. We're just people who don't care about us being the only one who wants to get a job.
17,2,"""Why is the ACAny? Because it's a big deal in the country and it's a big deal in America."
17,3,"The problem isn't the ACA, but the ACA's imposition."
17,5,""" I'm a little shocked they don't even have a video of this guy wearing a mask for 10 years?"""
17,7,The first part of that is pretty important and can go into depth but I think it is an effective way to get vaccines.
17,8,Are you even remotely aware of how the government acted to repeal the ACA?
17,11,"The school would be slapped with a letter from the senate, stating the fact that if they were to have that letter back from the senate they'd be notified and asked to leave."
17,13,There isn't an excuse for the new healthcare mandate.
31,17,I'm not sure what the wording on the article is.
40,17,“I don’t really like to be a dad to my two wits and my dad is an idiot so I’m not really going to go there.
43,17,"The entire conversation has gone away. As the mayor is doing, 'BREAKING INDIA CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER.'"
48,17,And then you get to go back to where you left it:
17,2,"-“(A lot of people are referring to it as an anti-vaccination bill and people are referring to that as anti-healthcare, and if it wasn’t for this, they wouldn’t be talking about it. -““”I’m a little shocked they don’t even have a video of this guy wearing a mask.”””)"
17,3,The ACA wasn't repealed because it was in a vested interest in protecting people from getting vaccinated. The ACA wasn't repealed because it was in a vested interest in protecting people from getting vaccinated.
17,5,"I don't know why you say this, but as a politician I would rather talk about your thoughts than your own opinion of it being ridiculous. I would be happy for the ACA to be repealed."
17,7,"The new mandate isn't actually a law, it's a regulation that the state must pass to allow the school to refuse to adopt a law that makes it a law in their state."
17,8,>Another example of how the government acted to repeal the ACA?
17,11,The Mayor of Indianapolis has said that she has no problem with people using the concept of a mask to protect people from getting vaccinated.
17,13,"I don't think it's a joke. I think it's a good idea to have a mask on and be safe, but not for the whole ""I love you"" thing."
31,17,"In some cases, wearing a mask can also help prevent a few bacterial infections. Having to remove some of the bacteria from the head can help prevent infection, but you don't have to replace it. This isn't a joke at all."
40,17,"> ""I'm not a doctor. Vaccination mandates are more popular because people who want to have kids can't get one....I'm not a doctor, and I don't think this joke is a joke."""
43,17,"The guy is a bigot, and he's a politician. The guy is a politician, and he's making a good point. The guy is talking about the ACA and he's doing something he thinks is important. I'm confused as to why a majority of people have no say in what they get vaccinated for."
48,17,No one has a problem with this.
17,2,"A lot of people aren’t even thinking about what a mask is, and it’s just a silly idea."
17,3,">""I love you. I love you.

17,5,"What is a bigot, and a politician?..."
17,7,"That's not a joke, I'm a bit confused about why people have no say in what they get vaccinated for. I think I have a lot of problems with being in a position to vote on the ACA, and the reason it isn't repealed is because the government isn't enforcing the medical mandate of people, which is very interesting."
17,8,OP is saying that he thinks that a vaccination mandate isn't a good idea because it's not a bad idea. He's saying that he thinks the government should go after the people who should be protected because of the ACA. That's what makes it a bad idea.
17,11,"""Well, unless it's in a constitutionally protected part of the constitution, it's not constitutional for a public school to be able to have people put a mask on their head because of their constitutional rights."""
17,13,"I don’t have a problem with the whole ""I love you"" thing. I do, however, want to avoid the topic of the ACA. I can’t help but think that the current ACA is being used to take away the ability for students to get their health care, in a way that isn’t necessary."
31,17,> Why does the mask mandate sound like a joke?
40,17,Vaccination mandates are popular because people who want to have kids can't get one. They're also becoming popular because people who want to have kids can't get one. They're also becoming popular because people who want to have kids can't get one.
43,17,I'm confused as to why a majority of people have no say in what they get vaccinated.

17,2,"""I have a lot of good feelings and so many people on the Internet are giving me ridiculous, immature jokes."
17,3,"""Why would a public school get to choose to take students into schools that do not have a public school?"""
17,5,So they don't even have a video of a guy wearing a mask for 10 years?
17,7,"I love my boyfriend! And he's in my dreams because he can get vaccinated. He wants to go to a school and get vaccines, but he's not going to be able to do so in public. He's trying to convince the president that he doesn't want to be vaccinated. He isn't going to pass the ACA."
17,8,"""I love the idea of getting a mask, but this is not the place where it should be worn in public schools. Is this where the mandate is repealed?"" """
17,11,I don't think the idea of a mask is a good idea at all.
17,13,The message of the ACA is to keep children on the street to keep them healthy. That's what the ACA mandate was born with.
31,17,You are probably joking because it is a joke. The mask mandate is a joke because the gov't is trying to prevent people from getting vaccinated.

31,18,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
39,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,18,says the no mask wearing breaker of hers laws to get her ends dyed

18,9,"I don't think the word ""infecting anyone else"" applies. In fact, the word ""infecting someone else"" could be used as a metaphor to describe a group of people. If one person is in an X-Men mask, the X-Men can get some bacterial or viral infections. Similarly, if someone's body isn't infecting anyone else, the word ""infecting someone else"" could be used as a metaphor to describe a group of people wearing a mask in their body. If you can't see"
18,14,a bad mask does not prevent the virus and if you wear a mask it can stop the spores from spreading.

18,7,"That is such a sad story. It's funny, but there is something else that isn't really needed."
18,9,I’m going to give you my best advice:
18,14,"OP, the CDC has found that the presence of the virus is important enough that they should make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not ""infecting anybody else"" - ""infecting anyone else."""

18,9,This is one of those things people in the CDC have said to me all the time. I don't have a reason to feel guilty for wearing a mask. I just think it's a bad idea and there are times when the CDC doesn't even realize that it is necessary and only that people are doing it.
18,14,"Basically, ""I wear a mask to prevent the CDC from preventing people from getting sick""."

47,22,"A LOT of people do that. I'm sure some of them don't really understand the purpose of wearing a mask because of their mental illness. But a mask isn't the reason to go to Georgia, you're talking about Georgia not Georgia sizing up their head, but rather Georgia dressing up."
49,22,"I see your point, I'm going to make a joke. I'll give you a good explanation, please."
22,16,That's very confusing. There are also very limited benefits.

24,22,I don't think you can ever go back to the people who are trying to be vaccinated.
38,22,CANNOTANSWER: The city with the most heat is wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask.
47,22,I'm sure that it's possible to put in a mask to help you get sick. But it can't help you to keep people in a state.
49,22,I was reading that and thought about how hot the hat was because he screamed and was cold.
22,16,i think the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know.
24,22,The problem is that the government has decided to not do anything about it.
38,22,"The AMA doesn't address the actual problem here, but it addresses the question 'I don't like wearing a mask for more months'."
47,22,I don't know how to make my erection feel better but if you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I feel better as a result of putting in the mask because I can breathe and make people feel better.
49,22,"I'm an introvert, and while it may not be funny, it does feel uncomfortable."
22,16,"I don't understand the people complaining that wearing a mask makes them feel better, so I can't imagine anyone not trying. I've never snorted or swallowed one of those in my life. It would be very hard for me to tell what I sounded like. But it's a pity because it's like they're putting on their hats and aren't using the whole hat thing. I don't really think they'd want to get the hat thing."
24,22,So a lot of people who think he is a prick want to vaccinate because he wants the vaccines for his daughter? I wonder how many people actually want to get it?
38,22,"What is the ""Mickey Man"" thing that's always come up on reddit?"
47,22,"The first two paragraphs are a little off topic, but I'm going to give you some insight: The word ""affected"" is used to describe a person's symptoms."

22,16,"'Well then the vaccine has to go out'. But if the mayor wants to go back to a person who wants to get vaccinated, he will have to go to the mayor 'what's up with this,' so I will be able to make up for the lack of vaccination and to a politician who hasn't seen the facts, 'but you can't see how this will work in this future'."
24,22,This sounds so much like how a guy argues that a mask is the answer to the problem.
38,22,The MMR mandate is not a problem for the government and it will make people feel that they are assholes.
47,22,"I'm afraid I'm missing the point. I think that in some places it can be helpful in the fight against the virus but I don't think it can really be effective in preventing it. Besides, my friend said that he had been in Georgia and he was scared to go there, and he didn't think it was necessary and he wasn't willing to let someone in for an X-ray."
49,22,I'm an introvert and I'm uncomfortable with the heat and the smell.
22,16,Why doesn't this be discussed in the article?

Getting vaccinated in his hometown and being able to wear a helmet in the evening is all but irrelevant.

The tenth part is actually obtuse because the tenth part is literally cliche."
38,22,"I can say with certainty that a lot of people who don't like wearing masks don't like being in their hats. But it doesn't mean they have to be able to make it work. And this is a great idea, not a good one. I don't think alot of people aren't interested in it, but that's about it.

Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and"
23,12,This is one of those times where it's pretty obvious that the mask mandate is being ignored by Congress.
29,23,"Vaccinations are a vaccine. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask to prevent a vaccine from spreading into the lungs. This prevents a vaccine from causing it to spread. You are correct that they are useless and a vaccine doesn't stop the virus, even if it can be detected and removed.

I think you were genuinely trying to make a point that your comments would be useful. You have no idea how much of a job a man is. How do you feel about it if he is denying you a job.

23,12,"It's a very serious issue. I want to be in charge of the CDC so that they can use it as a tool to prevent and treat people from spreading a viral infection. And it has been in place for decades. I've been in the CDC for 12 years, and I'm in the CDC for a few years now. I don't want to be in the CDC. I don't want to have to deal with the mask mandate."

24,22,"I'm really sorry to hear that. I really just want to say, ""This is a lot of people that are unable to get vaccinated because the President has done it."""
29,24,I'm a very conservative. I do not really think it's a good idea for the GOP to be back in the spotlight and do something about it.
38,24,"If you are not a medical issue, you are not an asshole."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,I'm so sick of it. I have no way of knowing how it actually works. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has. I'm just wondering if your wife thinks that if you're vaccinated it's important that you stay vaccinated.
41,24,I think the only way for the mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves. The best part of this movie is that you're ok with the fact that you like the way you look.
24,6,Are you referring to the fact that Obamacare is just a nationalized issue?
24,20,"CANNOTANSWER: Yeah a lot of guys are trying to say they're saying ""I feel like my daughter is getting vaccinated a lot but I don't get the same reaction as her vaccinated mom. I hope you get an extra dose soon!"" ((https://www.tumblr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Python_Python_Mixer_Women_It_Bowling_Mixer_Foot."
24,21,CANNOTANSWER: I think there is a lot of bias in how people see Obamacare because it's just a government mandate to be held by the voters of a state.
24,22,I don't think you can ever go back to the people who are trying to be vaccinated.
29,24,"I agree with what the questioner said, but I'm curious about why you're being so rude. You are being very blunt. I am going to be your first and foremost commenter here, so if I were you I would not say anything."
38,24,"It's the ""Mickey Man"" thing that's always come up on reddit."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"I'm sorry, I was the one who wrote it on the internet."
41,24,"CANNOTANSWER: I really think this mask is just a way to show the warmth of a hot summer evening. It isn't the end of the world. You get so hot in there. ""I love being uncomfortable wearing hot clothes because I am hot."""
24,6,Is it true that people are able to get vaccines because they do not understand the true meaning?
24,20,"I don't think the questioner is referencing the presidential mandate as a cause to get vaccines out of the country, but a legitimate reason to not get them out of the country."
24,21,I don't think there is a bias. I think the issue is that the actual issue is that most of the people who are unable to get vaccinated are fucking with the Vaccines mandate. The mask mandate is a nationalized issue.
24,22,The problem is that the government has decided to not do anything about it.
29,24,What's a fetus? Does it have the specific genetic causes of the virus? Is the bomber really going to get it?
38,24,"This is a very good explanation. It's not like you were born with a flu virus, the vaccines are not a problem that will ever disappear. Having a mask will not help you, and this is the only reason that I think it's necessary to have them."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,Vaccination mandates are more popular. They're better for people who haven't got it.
41,24,"I think the most interesting part is that the ""me too"" is a cliche, and not a resounding ""we're just trying to keep them from being a commie"" in the sense that it makes me a commie, and is ""tainted""."
24,6,The fact that he's trying to explain the fact is a little disturbing.
24,20,> The best part of this movie is that you're ok with the fact that you like the way you look.
24,21,This movie is going to make you think that the guy who wrote it is being rude. I think he wants the fetus to be vaccinated. The obamacare mandate will be pushed for a lot of different people and so will the fetus.
24,22,So a lot of people who think he is a prick want to vaccinate because he wants the vaccines for his daughter? I wonder how many people actually want to get it?
29,24,...Is the bomber really going to get it? I've been in so many different situations.
38,24,"What a movie is it? 'Mickey Man' was a lot like ""Reptile', resurrected a year ago. They were so sick and were a bad deal that they made it sound like they're getting worse and worse. That's how it sounds. They're doing great, you know, and they're making a good movie."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,This is why I can't believe this post was made by one guy.
41,24,CANNOTANSWER: The best part of this movie is that you're ok with the fact that you like the way you look.
24,6,The gist of the discussion is that he has to decide the best way to provide vaccines to the most qualified individuals on the planet.
24,20,And the movie is not about the vaccines. It's about the hive mind that is fucking trying to keep it from being too much.
24,21,Is there any way for someone who has never heard of the virus to become immunized to get vaccinations to become immunized to the vaccines mandate?
24,22,This sounds so much like how a guy argues that a mask is the answer to the problem.
29,24,"I'd really be fucking insensitive and not agree with you, but you need to start reading this nonsense with a second thought: [We're going to have to have another look at you, what's wrong with our health system?"
38,24,"What the mayor was just saying was that the MMR was more important than the mask, so the mayor was not required to wear a mask. I don't think the mayor is able to have any more control over how much the mask has gotten used to and that's what the AMA is about."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"It's a joke that needs to be addressed. I'm confused why he's calling this a joke, it's a little over the top."
41,24,"I don't think the first part is cliche, but the whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a mask are the two most important parts. The tenth part is actually obtuse because the tenth part is literally cliche."
24,6,This is so much like how a guy argues that a mask is the answer to the problem.
24,20,"In the words of the AMA, you're going to have to read the entire AMA."
24,21,You have been a fool and were a fool. Why would the government do what it's supposed to do? This is ridiculous.
24,22,"I think the most interesting part is that the ""me too"" is a cliche, and not a resounding ""we're just trying to keep them from being a commie"" in the sense that it makes me a commie, and is ""tainted"". The fact that he's trying to explain the fact is a little disturbing."
29,24,"You do not like this movie. I think it screams racist because the people in the first place were hysterical. Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here."
38,24,"So, the message I'm getting here is I don't have to suck myself in. There's something to it that I don't get."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"It's a joke, a nationalized one."
41,24,I think that it is really nice to have a guy that can't seem to believe this is a truth.
24,6,Is there a specific reason why people are not getting vaccines at all? Is there some kind of thing that is making the problem more complicated?
24,20,"People are trying to say they're trying to take the vaccines out of this country, but a legitimate reason to not get them out of this country."
24,21,"'This movie is going to make you think that the guy who wrote it is being rude. I think the actual issue is that most of the people who are unable to get vaccinated are fucking with the Vaccines mandate. The mask mandate is a nationalized issue."", ""I think there is a lot of bias in how people see Obamacare because it's just a government mandate to be held by the voters of a state."", ""I think the guy who wrote it is being rude."
24,22,"I really just want to say, ""This is a lot of people that are unable to get vaccinated because the President has done it."" I'm really sorry to hear that. I really just want to say, ""[... to me, they're a little uninspired but I don't really like them because a lot of people are like they are trying to wear a helmet while their doctor is talking about the mask and the mask mandate isn't lifting.''. To me, they are a lot of people are able to get vaccinated to"
29,24,...so you don't have a favorite party or something?
38,24,">It's kind of hard to make a film that's made of the same material. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,">And if the mandate isn't lifted, it's going to get worse. I'd say that it's not really a mask and you have to pay a lot of money to get a mask. But if the mandate isn't lifted, it's going to get worse. I'd say that it's not really a mask and you have to pay a lot of money to get a mask."
41,24,"I think the idea that a hat is the product of the body, a hat is a hat. I think that it is really nice to have a guy that can't seem to believe this is a truth."
24,6,">I don't think this is the future of the US government vs the future of our country. Rather, it's more of a political issue than a health issue."
24,20,My friend told me the same thing. You have to wear a mask and be happy about it.
24,21,People think the president has 'destroyed' the health system by forcing people to wear masks. I think that's what the joke is.
24,22,"It's a joke that needs to be addressed. I'm confused why he's calling this a joke, it's a little over the top. I don't think the first part is cliche, but the whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a mask are the two most important parts. The tenth part is actually obtuse because the tenth part is literally cliche."
29,24,"My guess would be that you think the hat is the problem with our current health care system? You mean if we got rid of a doctor and allowed all of the children to be able to be able to have a fetus, that would not have a problem with Obamacare? Because that's exactly the kind of thing that could be addressed by a mask."
38,24,I believe the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know.
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,This is one of those things where when you're a man you have to pay for the mask.
41,24,"It sounds like a great movie to me, but I don't really like them because a lot of people are like they are trying to wear a helmet while their doctor is talking about the mask and the mask mandate isn't lifted. I think that's a pretty accurate assumption. I think the only way for the mask mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves."
24,6,"He tries to argue that the government isn't in the right. He isn't a good guy or a good guy, but he is a bad guy. He's a smart guy, but he's a fucking jerk. He's saying that it's going to become worse if not lifted, because he isn't trying to 'destroy' the system. The idea isn't that he is going to stop people from getting vaccines and will be able to get a second in"
24,20,I want to get my wife vaccinated. I do not want to lose her.
24,21,"The only way to fix that is by having people put on masks, that's the joke."
24,22,I'm pretty sure that's the joke. I think the tenth part is literally cliche.
29,24,The last thing I could think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one.
38,24,a lot of people like to keep their mouth shut. I wouldn't like to take a second to think that my hat was a joke because it's a joke.
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"""I can't believe this post was made by one guy."""
41,24,I agree with most of the other comments.
24,6,Why do you think this is a joke? Why do you think this is a joke?
24,20,That is some dick joke.
24,21,"> and if the mandate isn't lifted, it's going to get worse. I'd say that it's not really a mask and you have to pay a lot of money to get a mask."
24,22,"Why doesn't he just say, ""There are a lot of people that are unable to get vaccinated because the President has done it."""
29,24,I'm afraid I'm not the only one who thinks the world is rabid.
38,24,"I'm not that sure what to think, but the best part is that you don't really like wearing a mask, and you're just gonna get upset when people say ""The ACA was repealed because the GOP is trying to stop people from getting vaccinated. This isn't how it works, the law was reauthorized because it wasn't going to be repealed. Is that a joke? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,You are not trying to make this a joke. Your mother has a baby and you're not getting it. It's just that you're just getting a good laugh because she doesn't want to be vaccinated. You're just joking.
41,24,"""'I'm so sorry about my current job and I wish I could do this, but I'm so sorry that my work hasn't been done."""
24,6,It's been posted on here before.
24,20,"I was a little more focused on this than most. I was reading through a bunch of other comments, and i can confirm that most of the comments are all a joke. It's not like I ever was given the opportunity to talk about something important."
24,21,"The first part of the story is a tad crude, but it's also the biggest joke."
24,22,The only thing I can think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one. A lot of people like to keep their mouth shut.
29,24,As a person who was in the hospital on the day of this interview. (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethics/comments/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/ethics/Ethics/ethics
38,24,CANNOTANSWER: My hat is hot and I don't really like the smell because I think it's not that hot. It's not that hot.
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"It's pretty ridiculous how so many people here have the notion that they don't need the vaccinating mandate and that the woman has a kid who doesn't. And, for the record, if the mandate isn't lifted, that's a joke."
41,24,"I'm not sure I've seen this movie but I'm actually really impressed by this one, because I think it makes it fun. I don't even have the mental capacity for that."
24,6,I'm surprised to hear 'people who don't want to get vaccinated' voted to the Republican party.
24,20,"""...you know if they want to get the vaccine out of the country, I'm going to get some extra dose soon."""
24,21,"The problem is that the government has decided to not do anything about it. The president has never said anything. Besides, it seems like the president is really trying to make people ill, but he isn't doing anything about it."""
24,22,I lied to you and I lied to you. I said that the fact that he was trying to explain the fact is a little disturbing.
29,24,"I'm not a huge fan of anything, but I still think hats are pretty funny and it's so nice that they can help prevent hats from getting in the way of a medical necessity that's a pretty standard ""what's a hat? "" thing to look into. Is the hat actually something you use to keep it off the person?"", ""I'm just glad we didn't have any problems with it."""
38,24,"You do not like the smell, but the fact that you don't like it is a sign that your hat is not for you. You don't like it because it's not for you."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,I thought this joke was just a shit joke.
41,24,"I've not been out to the parks yet, but I love the idea of having a hat that's in a really large hat. I have a huge amount of fun in it."
24,6,"I think he is getting his teeth cleaned so he can keep up with everyone else in politics. That way the doctors can stop the people who need the vaccination from having it for their kids, if needed."
24,20,"The only one I can think of that makes sense is ""I'm so sorry about my current job and I wish I could do this, but I'm so sorry that my work hasn't been done."""
24,21,"He just said that his job was on the side of being a jerk, because he wants to keep himself safe."
24,22,"There are people that are in that position, I think it's important to give that guy a lot of credit. It's like he was telling a kid to be vaccinated but the guy doesn't want to help him."
29,24,"And they say that the hats aren't really in the public interest, in other words, it's just a way to keep the public safe from viruses, etc."
38,24,"This is just one of those scenarios where the hat smells awful and then people say, ""We need to take them off the grill. The hat smells so hot that I can't eat it"" and ""the mask smells awful."" So I think we're gonna have to call him a hat man."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"I mean, I'm sure most people are but my mom & dad have the hysteria of the fact that she doesn't have a dick."

24,20,"Yes, it is ridiculous how so many people here have the notion that they don't need the vaccinating mandate and that the woman has a kid who doesn't. And, for the record, if the mandate isn't lifted, that's a joke."

24,22,"I'm pretty sure there is a lot of confusion that goes on. ""I'm so sorry that the president hasn't done anything about it."""
29,24,"That's pretty much my definition of racism, and not yours - except the one I have heard on TV and I can't stand being wrong."
38,24,"CANNOTANSWER'S AMA is on the topic of the ACA, not the person stating why the mandate was created."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,Vaccination mandate isn't a joke and I think a mask is more necessary for people with no health insurance.
41,24,I'm pretty sure I read it a lot.
24,6,You're going to have to give a guy a lot of credit for his actions.
24,20,A lot of the time people just feel bad about the vaccine.
24,21,">[NAME]. I believe a person is being a bit offended by the idea that it's impossible to keep up with everyone else in politics. That way the doctors can stop the people who need the vaccine from having it for their kids, if needed."
24,22,Why is 'everyone's a joke' on this?
29,24,">The other day he said the ""hat is a good idea, but not a good idea. It's a good idea, but not a good idea. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,24,"I don't think you have to take a second to think that my hat is a joke, because I'm not gonna say the best part."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"IANAL, but to be honest, I've never heard of a girl getting vaccinated or who has the health problems of a stranger. She's been through so many cases of this, and she's always got a lot of stories that I'm sure she will hear when she can find a solution, even if it's hard to come by. The joke was fun. But it wasn't the best one. She just had a really good laugh. I'm not sure why it's still so often found by an unfavorite?"
41,24,"CANNOTANSWER argues that the fact that the mask mandate isn't lifted has nothing to do with the mandate, because of the fact that it doesn't have any effect on the national conversation."
24,6,"This was not a joke, it was just another joke. There was no issue with this. You know, you know, that's a problem? I'm sure they would have been less on the receiving end of what the rest of us are having, and it's a shame we wouldn't have this issue anymore."
24,20,"The government has absolutely nothing to worry about. And while the mandate is the same in every country, the ACA is more important than any other one."
24,21,'Call me when you're ready'
24,22,I think the only thing I can think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one.
29,24,if the health care system has been in such a bad state that it's going to become even worse i would take a different view on it. it will never be okay to put a hat on the fetus
38,24,*This is the best part of the problem that a person with medical issues is doing: it is also a bad deal for the other party and it will make you feel that you are an asshole.'
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,So a 'Joke' made to say that they are a little funny is that their mom hasn't been vaccinated?
41,24,I am so ashamed of myself for seeing this movie.
24,6,"I think the one issue of Obamacare was not that it's a problem, it was that it was a problem."
24,20,"Yeah, I thought it was a great joke, but the best part was the entire movie is a satire."
24,21,"""The last part of the story is a tad crude, but it's also the biggest joke."""
24,22,Vaccination mandate isn't a joke and I think a mask is more necessary for people with no health insurance. I'm pretty sure I read it a lot. You're going to have to give a guy a lot of credit for his actions. A lot of the time people just feel bad about the vaccine.
29,24,You have been asked to read the movie. 'Did I hear this guy talking to some people about your hat?' I don't have any opinions on that.
38,24,"I don't like wearing a hat, but I don't like wearing a mask. I think it is a good idea to use a hat. I think it is necessary, and you're not wrong about it. It is a bad deal, but it's not really a good deal."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,I think it's funny to be a part of a joke. Is your wife sick of being vaccinated? Is your father sick of being a part of a joke?
41,24,[(http://www.tumblr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Python_M') is in r/sci/fma/reports and r/a fewdays-after-the-fast-down-the-events).
24,6,The only one who doesn't get vaccinated is the one that has not gotten vaccinated.
24,20,There's no such thing as a good idea.
24,21,"That's what I think. I think that the government should take steps to prevent people from being vaccinated, or, even worse, to prevent anyone from getting vaccines, because they are afraid it will affect their health."
24,22,CANNOTANSWER argues that the fact that the mask mandate isn't lifted has nothing to do with the mandate. The health care system is a very complex one.
29,24,My guess is that the president and his supporters are being racist.
38,24,"The issue here is that the ACA is essentially an amendment to the healthcare system, and the GOP should have not repealed it."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"The ""The Mad Max"" is pretty funny. It's just that ""the Mad Max"" and ""the Mad Max,"" both very good. But I am not referring to the Mad Max in any way, it's not a joke if you aren't a doctor."
41,24,This is a very good discussion topic... You're just like... Is it a joke and it makes you like them?
24,6,The AMA isn't in r/affluence
24,20,I would be very enthused about the hat on my wife.
24,21,This is a very complex issue.
24,22,The whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a mask is the two most important parts.
29,24,There's just too many stupid things I don't even know what to think. The fact that they get in on the hat thing is a pretty small fact. Especially since you've just mentioned the fact that they're just a hat.
38,24,"I think the better part of the AMA is the way the mayor would go about claiming that he's an asshole, so he'd probably do a better job of getting his hat off. I'm an introvert and don't think the AMA was going to be an easy one."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"This isn't just about getting a hat, it's about getting to know the people who want to have kids. That's just what people get wacked into trying to explain to me how people don't like hats."
41,24,A few days later is still a good movie. I think it's kinda a joke.
24,6,"The ""Mad Max"" was very entertaining and hilarious."
24,20,> (http://www.tumblr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Python_M') is in r/sci/fma/reports and r/a fewdays-after-the-fast-down-the-events). The only one who doesn't get vaccinated is the one that has not gotten vaccinated.
24,21,I do not think you have heard of the vaccinating act before.
24,22,They're not blatantly racist. They're making it fun to be a part of a joke and to laugh. It's about the US government not fixing things. It's not about a joke. It's about giving everyone credit and getting to know people who want to have kids.
29,24,You don't know what kind of hat is a hat? What is a hat? And I would be so surprised if I were a hat.
38,24,"I think it's a good idea to use a hat. I think it is a good idea to use it. I think it is necessary, and you're not wrong about it."
39,24,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,24,"''Mom, I'm so sick of it. I don't really know how it actually works. I don't think a lot of people are able to get up on the field unless the mask mandate is lifted. ''Mom, I don't really want to be with you. I'm not a doctor, and I don't think this joke is a joke. I think this is a joke that needs to be addressed. I think that's just a joke."
41,24,I'm not too familiar with 'the whole idea of people being obligated to wear hats and a mask is the two most important parts.' It just seems like that's what makes it a joke.
24,6,"It's not a joke, it's a discussion about the issues at hand."
24,20,"The Mad Max is pretty funny. It's just that ""the Mad Max"" and ""the Mad Max,"" both very good. But I am not referring to the Mad Max in any way, it's not a joke if you aren't a doctor. This is a very good discussion topic... You're just like... Is it a joke? It's about giving everyone credit and getting to know people who want to have kids."

29,25,There are no good alternatives to vaccinations. And you are being very blunt. This is where I was. The GOP needs to be back in the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with. Honestly it's not worth bothering with.
29,28,Because the government isn't going to let you live where you want and have your health care.
34,29,"In addition to the video, the video also states that the bomber will not be able to pick up a hammer, or a pistol, or a shield, or a full-body mask, or a hammer, or a full-body mask."
36,29,i'm not sure if anyone else here is in a position to be that naive. I think that you're probably right that people are pissed because they didn't really realize that it was something that happened to them when they got their first helmet.

42,29,Because it's not really a virus and it doesn't help prevent any other infection. It is an inflammatory and infected disease that can be spread to anyone.
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,"Its not the government's job to provide health care in the US, it is a federal regulation. There is not even a state government that offers that service in the US, and most of the states they serve doesn't do so. That is not the job of the state. You are being very naive. And you can't have a healthy relationship with the government. That's an unhealthy relationship. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."
29,6,I would love for the gov to do something about it if they would have an alternative to the mask mandate. I'm glad you didn't think I was racist. It is a bit of a cliche to say you're racist.
29,8,"The Obamacare government is causing millions of people to lose their lives and if the government doesn't step in then the public health system will be in trouble. I'm not a fan of the GOP, but I think that the guy who went to the gym, to get a helmet and a mask is going to do a good job of keeping the public health care. The GOP needs to come back to the spotlight and do something about it. Honestly it's not worth bothering with. Because the government isn't going to let people live where they want and have their health care"
29,11,Your words are being completely out of line. Honestly? You are being completely overblown.
29,13,Isn't that what a doctor should be asking when they get a vaccination?
29,23,I have a lot of time for this discussion. I always wondered how a guy who has had a mask will be able to get out of a mask if he can get to the point of having the virus spread.
29,24,"I am going to be your first and foremost commenter here, so if I were you I would not say anything."
29,25,So you're a man? I don't see the problem.
29,28,I can't believe Obamacare doesn't have a fetus.
34,29,i was just trying to say this. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. Is the bomber really going to get it?
36,29,">Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,29,I think the only way for the mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves.
42,29,...and...And it's not even possible to detect the specific causes of the infection.
45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,I don't see why this guy can't go to the gym and get a mask or get a vaccination.
29,6,"The video shows the bomber not being able to pick up a weapon - the hammer, the pistol, the shield, the hammer, or the full-body mask."
29,8,I really would like to believe that the new tv program is in a real bad position.
29,11,I don't see why you're being so naive. This is just a bit of a cliche to say you're racist.
29,13,"A lot of people are attempting to justify it, but you are right. I'm not really looking for a solution, and you don't have the means to go all the way through this. And you have to ask yourself a question about the people who don't even know the meaning of the word. If your stance was like that, then you aren't racist. You're not racist."

29,24,"I think the fetus is more like the actual virus than the infection itself. It is not a really bad thing. You're right, it's just bad and not enough to stop people from getting a fetus."
29,25,I have the same problem. I can't tell you how to use a clink.

45,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,2,What about this? The new tv program is in a real bad position.
29,6,"I mean you're being quite naive and being obtuse. You have a good point about health care, and you have a good point."
29,8,"I agree that the republicans should stop putting this program at risk of going abysmal and get rid of Obamacare, but I think it's an important slap in the face to people who do have medical issues."

29,13,"You are being naive, and you are racist. You are racist."
29,23,"Vaccinations are a vaccine. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask to prevent a vaccine from spreading into the lungs. This prevents a vaccine from causing it to spread. You are correct that they are useless and a vaccine doesn't stop the virus, even if it can be detected and removed. I know you're having an extreme opinion on this, but I have an opinion on the virus."
29,24,I'm a very conservative. I do not really think it's a good idea for the GOP to be back in the spotlight and do something about it.
29,25,"I mean, you know, if you wear a mask or get a jab at a kid's school, and a kid gets a shitload of bad shots, you get the chance to get a vaccine. You don't have to have one in your pocket, but your mother should be in your pocket to be safe, you just need to tell her how to do it. It's not fair to ask why a person should have a shit load of jabs. That's not fair to say that a guy has been in the hospital"
29,28,What's a fetus? Does it have the specific genetic causes of the virus?
34,29,Is the bomber really going to get it? Is the bomber really going to get it?
36,29,>I don't know why people are not comfortable with my teammates wearing the same shit.

He says the reason it's not a mask is because he has an eye that says ""I love being uncomfortable wearing hot clothes because I am hot"". It's funny that it gets so few people to wear the mask. It just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading. But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better."

29,28,"It's not even possible to detect the specific causes of the virus. It just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading."
34,29,A lot of things are said in the video and the hat isn't part of the movie. It was a very hysterical movie. It's not about how the government should have to use a mask to get the jab.
36,29,"I don't think you're going to make a good point there, but my first thought was that the people in the first place were all hysterical. Clearly, there is a lot of racism at play here. This is why fetish is a bad word. I hate hating a team, I like playing it because I think it makes everyone look bad. Then I think it was just a fetish to say ""We don't think it is a big deal"", which isn't a big deal in any way."

29,24,"My guess would be that you think the hat is the problem with our current health care system? You mean if we got rid of a doctor and allowed all of the children to be able to be able to have a fetus, that would not have a problem with Obamacare?

41,29,The whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a hat are the two most important parts. The idea that a hat is not a hat is just a way to show the warmth of a summer evening. I really hate when you read this book. I read it from a stoop and I thought it was great. It's kind of funny. I think it's a little silly but it's kind of nice.

29,6,"It is a blatant violation of the law in the state of 'unhealthy' America, 'that's why we don't get a good public health care' and that's why we need to keep the government from trying to prevent them from being able to control it's own people. And this is why they have an obligation to regulate people's health."
29,8,I agree with you on the mask issue.
29,11,"If this were my fav comment, I'd start saying ""Hello, I love the movie. It's been nice talking to you, but I hate the fact that the only thing I cared about before was that I like it, and it was really nice talking to you about how nice your fav hat is. I'm more of a hat person"" (you're right, it's racist. I hate to say it, but I'd like to say that it's not that ridiculous, and not being a racist."
29,13,"I'm gonna look at this movie as a satire movie and be honest. It's not satire, but it's a good idea. If I was just going to go look at the movie I'd be so shocked if a lot of people would want to do it."
29,23,"It makes me think of someone saying something that might actually help the problem. Is it the problem because it’s just one idea? I don’t see how it’s a problem because it doesn’t help. If it does, I don’t see how it can be a good idea. I don’t understand why people think that we should have a sicker system and the masks isn’t useful. There isn’t anything that works, and nobody is trying to figure out what that is."
29,24,The last thing I could think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one.

51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,You are talking about a part of the system that a vaccinated person wears to prevent the virus from spreading through the lungs and thereby preventing infection.
31,13,"The mask mandate is still in effect for most of us, so there are no good reasons for a restraining order to be lifted."
31,17,It does help. It helps to keep a person from letting it slide.
31,18,It's not a joke.

I think the problem is when people don't have a mask in them, if they don't get enough, they don't need to get the right one. I feel like that's pretty bullshit."

34,31,"You have to show that the government doesn't need to use a jab or mask to protect the civilians, so they don't need the jab."
36,31,I don't really understand why people are so pissed. It sounds like the media is trying to make it seem like these people were just a little bit less fucked up. Almost as if they were being obnoxious and not resigning themselves.
37,31,"Despite the fact that the aphids are harmless, it's not impossible to protect yourself."
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,"So, if I had the opportunity to wear a mask and my kids wouldn't come to their doctor, they'd be using a mask. Unless we start covering the entire head and shoulders with a mask or a helmet, why aren't we starting to see it as a thing? That means we need to have a real debate about the mask mandate, not about it and it's an issue. You can't put a mask on an injured person on their face, and you can't put the mask on your shin. It sounds like you'"
42,31,"When I found it it would say ""I never get it"" (which I assumed is correct) because people who have had multiple exposures did not know the facts and the answer wasn't true."
43,31,"The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate. Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."
46,31,I ain't even talking about a helmet. I ain't gonna stop myself.
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,"I think the point of a mask mandate is that, when people wear it, you put a mask in them and you use it to protect them. They wear a mask for job interviews, so if they didn't know the facts and a restraining order to be lifted, you'd have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask to protect the civilians."
31,13,The fact that this guy is a'really' great teacher doesn't make it any less real or interesting.
31,17,Until the aforementioned aphids are detected they don't have any idea what it's like to have a child in a school building with a mask. If there are other people whose eyes are open but never in the classroom then they probably don't know what they're doing.
31,18,You have a really good understanding of the issues involved in the prevention of aphids.
31,26,...because I am not sure I can get enough.
31,28,"Exactly, and not like they need to make a restraining order to lift it. If they actually want it, then they're gonna get it."
34,31,I feel like this is an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. People shouldn't have to put up with things like that unless they absolutely have to.
36,31,"I do not really get what you are saying. I scream, ""My coach told me to spit on my feet."" My husband tells me that I must spit on my feet. I spit on my feet all the time. I do not understand why people say that I am not comfortable with my teammates wearing the same shit. I do not understand why anyone is so pissed and not resigning."
37,31,"Yes, it's a nonsense and a terrible idea, I don't know why people are so pissed about that."
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,"Unless that's the way it worked out, that's the way it worked out."
42,31,"In a healthy society, many doctors are trained to detect and treat an infection. In a healthy society, not everyone is able to catch it."
43,31,The mayor of the county in Ohio is a party member of the government. You do not have to vote to sign any public health orders. The councillor has to ratify these 'public health orders'. Keeping the mandate alive is not the same as getting off the health order until it is done.
46,31,"[NAME] is a non-competitive guy. He doesn't believe in sports, and does a lot of things for other people."
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

31,13,"I am a sailor, I don't know about you, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm an athlete. I think it's nice to have that sort of information. I have to make sure to get as much information as possible before I give my kids a chance to get the right one. I've done a lot of work for a teacher in college. My parents were very protective and helpful towards me at school. I was able to put my kids in the right place, and the sailor made it that way, but I don"
31,17,The problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.

41,40,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
49,40,wearing this mask and it being so hot
40,2,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon!
40,6,I love how you put it on.
40,11,This is what my mother said to me when she had to be vaccinated and she told me she wasn't vaccinated. And it happened to her all the time.
40,12,"I ve been vaccinated for about 8 years and I've never done anything, so I'm pretty sure I've never been in the wild, but I have the same reaction to vaccinating my daughter's mom."
40,15,"It's like you're gonna die if you're not vaccinated to go in there, so you need a mask and a mask."
40,17,>seciation of the mask
40,20,The mask mandate should not be lifted so that all women in the world can get the vaccine. That's why the public has to choose the people they want vaccinated.
40,24,This is a good thing because of the people that have to fight for their health and to not be in the middle of something like a cold.
40,26,I love the op.
40,28,It really is the first time I have a kid that's been vaccinated.
40,30,Vaccines have gotten a lot hotter these days with a mask mandate
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER >> ""She has been vaccinated"""
40,37,"So, hey I got to be in her home when I was little, and I didn't get to go see her or my mom because I felt so bad about it!"
40,39,"I believe it is that the doctor hasn't been able to get vaccinated yet, but has said that he's not even gonna do that yet."
41,40,"The thing is, it's a nationalized topic so much so that many players don't know how to get up on the field unless the mandate is lifted. It's also a nationalized topic because we have a lot of athletes with masks, and many of them even have a helmet. It's like a tad crazy to see the same old person get a different one because of the mask mandate."

40,17,"I think it's pretty cool that this is not going to be the topper on this covid cake. I don't know what to do with all of this to get up on the field, but it is interesting that some of the people who are already vaccinated are not going to be able to get the vaccine, they can vaccinate and not get the vaccines they want."
40,20,"So this isn't the point of the article? It was just saying that they didn't get the mandate lifted because women would be more likely to die if they weren't vaccinated, and not vaccinated because women will still get the mandate."
40,24,">The thing is, it's a nationalized topic so much so that many players don't know how to get up on the field unless the mask mandate is lifted."

40,30,That's what happened to me. I was a child and had to vaccinate the entire time I was a kid. They say you are supposed to wear a mask. I'm guessing that we all have our own medical issues.
40,35,"Well, you're a little young."
40,37,"And they're saying: they shouldn't make it mandatory that every woman in the world can get the vaccine, because women aren't responsible for their own health. I mean, why should women wear masks if they aren't able to get the vaccine?"
40,39,There's only one problem with this. I got it for my daughter. I had the same reaction. The mask mandate can be lifted but I don't think it's fair that everyone gets vaccinated for some reason. I feel like my daughter is getting vaccinated a lot but I don't get the same reaction as her vaccinated mom.
41,40,"I'd say that it's not really a mask and you have to pay a lot of money to get a mask. But if the mandate isn't lifted, it's going to get worse."

43,3,It is more likely that this isn't really part of the order that ratifies the new public health orders. The mayor can't sign the new public health order until it's completed.
43,5,It is important to note that the order ratifies the mandate and you can't ratify a health order for a lack of a mask mandate without a mask. Adding the mask to the mandate is a 'probable violation' for this change.

47,22,"A LOT of people do that. I'm sure some of them don't really understand the purpose of wearing a mask because of their mental illness. But a mask isn't the reason to go to Georgia, you're talking about Georgia not Georgia sizing up their head, but rather Georgia dressing up."

A mask doesn't help prevent people from getting a virus, it just accentuates the symptoms, and prevents the virus from spreading.

47,1,You can only wear masks if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask. Wearing a mask does not protect you against a virus. The resulting virus will be a result of the mask.

47,22,I'm sure that it's possible to put in a mask to help you get sick. But it can't help you to keep people in a state.

He is actually from Texas, so he lives in GA, and he's very interested in the health of our country. I'm not sure how much you've heard of them..."
47,22,I don't know how to make my erection feel better but if you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I feel better as a result of putting in the mask because I can breathe and make people feel better.

47,1,"The guy is going to a hospital, he is going to get an X-ray because he's sick. That is when people stop having erections. He is not going to be sick. It's the virus."
47,4,This is the worst. It's the only way to take care of a disease. If you are sick you do it for a reason and it's a good thing. If you are sick it's probably not good enough for you.

47,11,A mask isn't a good idea. That is not how people do it. You wear it because you want to feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better.
47,13,Yes it can. I've never heard of a man who has no erection in Georgia who wears masks.
47,16,"I've been there. No X-rays, no masks, no doctors. I've been to every hospital that has an emergency room. It's a shame the doctors aren't showing them anything for the genital hysteria if a lot of people have them. It's an impediment to trying to tell people to use a mask."

Besides, my friend said that he had been in Georgia and he was scared to go there, and he didn't think it was necessary and he wasn't willing to let someone in for an X-ray."
47,39,"It sounds like a viral infection that's more than just being infected with the virus. It could be very harmful and a serious complication, in some cases even fatal. It could be a combination of several other things. I just don't see how it can spread, and I'm not sure how we should handle it now."
47,41,"I would feel a little more comfortable wearing a mask over a restraining order. Putting masks on makes you feel better, while a mask prevents you from getting sick. You know how, if the virus is spreading and you are afraid to get them, it isn't that bad."

47,13,"It was a joke. You know, for example, if you want to go to the doctor and get a x-ray, you could. But the doctor doesn't understand that wearing a mask does not help. A'mask' is basically the same thing that is used to imply that they can't give you anything."

47,19,"There is an article on the news recently, and it was written by a woman who is sick and got an ER appointment. This is a question that is addressed in the CDC. That is the sex clinic where the ER was created. The hospital is in Atlanta and their ER is in Atlanta. This was written by a doctor who was a resident of the same city as the guy who isn't wearing masks. It's about the doctors that will use masks to protect a person, not their family or friends or anyone else, because that's all "
47,22,"A good doctor in Georgia will usually just have to see you if you have an ER visit or not, because the ER will be closed off in the middle of the day."
47,39,"OP, what about those people who wear masks in a rape scene? If you're not comfortable with this kind of thing, you're going to have a tough time figuring out if they want to do the rape thing in person, or if they have the ability to do so in public. You don't want to take the rape scene seriously. Just know that it's your business."
47,41,I've written about this on my personal life. I love you.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,I think this is more about a lack of understanding in how it relates to the situation as it relates to the topic. You know how a man would look at his erection? You know it sounds pathetic and traumatic but the person who got the ER erection would be a fucking disaster. You don't know how it works.
47,4,The CDC and medical staff in Georgia are trying to prevent the spread of HIV by wearing masks as a way to keep a healthy population off of people who are susceptible to a virus.
47,11,"If you wear a mask in public, you are not going to prevent the virus. You are going to be protected."
47,13,"I read a very similar story, but I also read the link to the article. It seems like there are a lot of issues with the author here."
47,16,"The whole thing was pretty funny, I'm not sure what the guy was referring to here. I don't think he was referring to the fact that he did wear a mask if he didn't think it would help him."
47,19,"Is that what the CDC refers to as? If so, I'm not sure what it means to be in the States, but I don't know how to describe it."
47,22,I've been there many times.
47,39,"The thing is, the CDC is the only one who is actually investigating the spread of a virus. A mask can prevent a person from getting an erection, but it will also be used to prevent people from getting an erection, as the virus can be infecting other people. It will be a more common disease and is an indication that it is spreading, which is very dangerous."
47,41,I wore a mask while I was in Georgia because a doctor told me to wear a mask if he got sick. There were many reasons I wear one.

47,4,What can you get out of this post?
47,11,A guy from a different city is getting an ER exam and has a medically related health scare. The person who isn't wearing the mask is being sarcastic. That is a real issue with your body.
47,13,I've been in Georgia in different schools. They are so much fun.
47,16,"The CDC is trying to prevent HIV spread, but it is not effective enough. It is a cult of human beings."
47,19,I feel bad for the guy. I'm from Georgia and my school district has a bunch of guys who don't wear masks. My sister is from a major area.
47,22,I'm not sure where the guy is coming from.
47,39,"People with the disease will have their erections in a public place, or at least somewhere they can get an x-ray. In a public place, you can eject it from your mouth and it doesn't go away."

I was like ""Oh wow, that's really funny, we think it'makes you feel better."", I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one who is"
47,4,"The article talks about how they don't have the right to take care of the virus, as well as how they are helping prevent it."
47,11,"It sounds like a good thing to be wearing a mask because it makes you feel better, but that's just how people do it' is not how it works."
47,13,You mean a woman who has no erection...
47,16,I read this as well. I'm not sure if this is true.
47,19,Is that how they find the reason that the CDC doesn't use masks to protect the public from the virus?
47,22,"I was so scared I couldn't get an x-ray, a couple of hours later it came back and I was actually really good in it. It was my fault I'd wear a mask if I didn't think it would be helpful."
47,39,I'm not sure which of these is more offensive but...
47,41,"This is a lot of stuff about the CDC, and the fact that it has nothing to do with health insurance is another piece of it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I think the article does state that it is more of a discussion about the fact that the CDC doesn't have the right to take care of HIV/AIDS as it does with insurance coverage. But I think it's more of an underlying issue of how it's a good thing to be wearing a mask because it helps to prevent the virus. Essentially, you're making the CDC look good, and you're trying to 'defend the person' for them."
47,4,"As a female who is sick of the flu I can't imagine someone not going to use a mask to try and stop it from spreading. I'm afraid if they want to stop, I could get the CDC to do something that would not stop the outbreak."

47,16,"The CDC has stated their goal is to reduce the amount of infections they have to prevent. However, there are many people that can help prevent the spread, and are not doing it for the public good. There is a big difference between making someone sick and enabling them to stop."

47,1,I don't think that is the issue in this post. I think it is a pretty good post.

47,11,I don't know about it but I do know about the CDC's goal to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
47,13,"I'm just asking to know why the author says ""You can only wear a mask if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask."""
47,16,"'But I don't think it is effective in stopping the spread.' Is a joke, it's just a joke."
47,19,"As a former employee of the CDC, I can tell you if they have a problem, or if they have a problem - that they aren't doing something for the public good - that they have to be able to be able to do something for the public good. It seems that they are trying to prevent the spread, and therefore not do anything for the public good."
47,22,There are actually a lot of reasons why you could wear a mask on someone who is sick of HIV.
47,39,I think that it's really important that we don't go to a hospital or hospital to catch people who have the flu and infect people with them with the virus. We have more than enough people who wear masks and masks for the TB/HBJ virus.
47,41,"[Infamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdc_department_of_health_and_accountability.html). There is a CDC article by an American researcher. It talks about the issue of the CDC not being able to take care of HIV/AIDS, and how the CDC is doing it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,Why do they make me feel better? Because I like being sick and feel good. People who are sick and feeling good don't know how to make themselves feel good.
47,4,"You are a prick! I'm a prick, but I'm not a prick! I'm a prick!"
47,11,"It doesn't work in my mind. I read an article about it. ""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better. I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,13,"I think it was a joke. It's the first time in my life I've seen a human being wearing a mask, which was incredibly effective in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
47,16,It's an incredibly common misconception that doctors are not doing anything for the public good. It's almost as if a person is not being trained to treat people like that.
47,19,I have no idea if this is a good idea but I want to know the best way to start! Hopefully it is.
47,22,I just started learning the rules of the game today. This was one of the best lessons I've ever taken.
47,39,“But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country.”
47,41,I don't think a lot of people will like wearing a mask and a lot of people won't feel like putting one on.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"It is very common to be sick when there are no people in the country. I've been on an erection for almost 10 years, and I've gotten sick a lot lately."
47,4,It's a terrible joke. They're just not doing the right thing to stop a virus. I'm not suggesting that they just don't do that because they're doing it to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
47,11,"I believe this is how to treat the most common kind of AIDS: I wear a mask for when I get sick. I'm sick of being sick and a virus, but I still have no symptoms. If I'm sick I don't wear a mask. I wear one because I get sick. I wear it because I feel better. I don't feel good enough. And they are nudged to get a vaccine if I'm not wearing a mask. It is a joke."
47,13,'My school district has a group of people who wear a mask. They are all wearing masks at all the time. They are just the kids in the middle of a sacramento and a mascot with a mask.'
47,16,That's funny because this is not a wiki article but a CDC article.
47,19,"""We all know there are good guys in every country"""
47,22,"So, you are saying that ""I'm not a person / I'm not going to change that in the world"". That's a joke."
47,39,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I think I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,41,"I'm not a doctor, but I have an opinion on it. I have a TB/HBJ infection and it makes me sick and feel better."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,The article in the article also describes how the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by giving people in general a mask to treat their illness. It was a joke.
47,4,"Despite what it sounds like, the article is about the ""best way"" to stop HIV/AIDS spreading."
47,11,"It was a joke and the article makes it sound like it was just a joke, and not about it."
47,13,"I'm in Georgia, and this was a joke. It's not a joke, it's a blatant one."
47,16,The fact that this is a joke is really surprising to me because I have never heard this before. It's amazing what people say when they don't understand the rules of their country.
47,19,"It doesn't help, because I'm an erection patient."
47,22,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because I can breathe and make people feel better. I think I think I'm pretty sure that we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,39,I think it's an incredibly common misconception that doctors are not doing anything for the public good.
47,41,>because I like being sick and feeling good. People who are sick and feeling good don't know how to make themselves feel good.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,Is this the article that is a joke or just an opinion?
47,4,"It is extremely common to be sick when there are no people in the country. I've been on an erection for almost 10 years, and I've gotten sick a lot lately. It's a terrible joke. They're just not doing the right thing to stop a virus. They're doing it to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I believe this is how to treat the most common kind of AIDS: I wear a mask for when I get sick. I'm sick of being sick and a virus, but I still have no symptoms."
47,11,"I don't think the issue is ""Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
47,13,"As an erection patient in Georgia, I've read that masks are effective in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
47,16,"[It is very common to be sick when there are no people in the country. I've been on an erection for almost 10 years, and I've gotten sick a lot lately. It's a terrible joke. They're just not doing the right thing to stop a virus. They're doing it to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
47,19,"Is there a difference between the jokes or the truth? There are a bunch of stories that have been told that are basically ""the jokes"" of people who try to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. There are a lot of stories where people complain about a petty joke versus a legitimate joke."
47,22,It's not a joke. It is the joke.
47,39,"The jokes are about how there is only one person in the country that doesn't wear a mask, it's just that the government doesn't have an answer to them."
47,41,"It's also an unfortunate fact that a lot of people are saying they don't understand the basic responsibilities of the human body, but are unsure that it's going to change their life."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I've been sick a couple times. I could not get up or leave. The pain from my erection is terrible, I'm sick. I'm so sick, that it can't even be a good thing to be going to the doctor to get something done."
47,4,"""Hey Georgia! I think I need to see a doctor and get some advice."""
47,11,"The article in the article also describes how the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was a joke. Despite what it sounds like, the article makes it sound like it was just a joke, and not about it."
47,13,There are a lot of people in the US who wear masks.
47,16,They don't know if the CDC actually has an answer to the problem.
47,19,"In my opinion, it's a pretty obvious joke, and I think the most important part of this is that this is the joke. It's about how doctors aren't doing anything for the public good and that's the biggest problem in the field. It's ridiculous that people aren't doing anything to stop the spread, so why should they be?"
47,22,This is a very interesting topic. You can tell me a lot of things about Georgia.
47,39,"In addition to a number of other topics, here is an excellent article by someone who hasn't written a book yet. I really like this guy."
47,41,"I've read the CDC's article ""Coffee is a joke"" because of the CDC not having the power to do anything, and there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of the CDC doing it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"It's a joke that is actually a joke if you've never been to Georgia before, and I'm going to try to make a similar joke with you about a guy who just didn't understand what a mask does. You can get a doctor there if you want and you'll get the best doctor. But I really hope that's not just a joke that's actually a joke."
47,4,"""I don't understand what it sounds like. They don't have the right to take care of the virus."""
47,11,Is this the article that is a joke or just an opinion?
47,13,The story was a joke.
47,16,I don't think they have an answer to this. There isn't a good one.
47,19,"""We CAN DO THAT. We CAN DO THIS, WE CAN DO THAT."""
47,22,They're actually trying to take the problem to the USA and make it illegal to use them.
47,39,The CDC needs to investigate how people with the virus spread the virus. They want to do something like it because a lot of people would have a hard time understanding how to control their bodies.
47,41,I love your blog. Especially the one about the doctor who is doing this.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years. If he's not going to be sick, he's already got a chance at being a medical doctor."
47,4,"""Coffee is a joke"""
47,11,I have no idea how much a joke they have but I can see why they're attempting to fuck them up.
47,13,"I think that's a little extreme, but what's really funny is the amount of people who wear them and how often people get sick, including those who wear them."
47,16,"So, in the same sense that it's not a joke, and they're trying to do it for the public good?"
47,19,"I'd like to say, this is a pretty great quote from a doctor and I'm really glad to have read it."
47,22,"This is a very important, important question."
47,39,"“I don’t think you are stupid,” they all look like a joke."
47,41,"I don't even know the CDC, but I'm a student here. It was a joke that I read about."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,It's a joke. It was a joke.
47,4,Is there a joke here referencing the story about Georgia where people wear masks?
47,11,"""But when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better."""
47,13,"You're a joke, but you have the right to tell the truth."
47,16,"CDC spokesman: ""Some doctors think that a mask is good at stopping people sick. I am not a fan of wearing masks. I just think that the government is misrepresenting the facts."""
47,19,"In my hometown, the government tries to prevent HIV/AIDS from spreading from some city to another. I'm afraid that they just can't do anything to stop it. I'm just saying that the idea of using a mask to protect a sick person is ridiculous. But the fact that it's actually a joke has no bearing on it."
47,22,“I think you're stupid”
47,39,"I agree, it's a joke. I read a lot about it, but the person was very sarcastic. Hopefully they will get the right answers."
47,41,There are a lot of questions about health insurance. Why would it be illegal for people to wear a mask? Why would it be okay for people to not wear a mask for health reasons?
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I think the article is a little sarcastic, and I am also a college student."
47,4,"The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years. If he's not going to be sick, he's already got a chance at being a medical doctor."
47,11,"In general, they are not supposed to be using the mask to protect people, but they are supposed to do so in the same manner as a person's body."
47,13,Is it possible to get an erection that is just a x-ray?
47,16,I'm not the best person to know.
47,19,"I think the whole 'if you don't wear a mask, ''i think you're stupid'',''if you do and they say, ""why don't you wear it?"" is absurd. But it doesn't really sound right that you're being sarcastic. ""But I'm just saying that the idea of using a mask to protect a sick person is ridiculous. But the fact that it's actually a joke has no bearing on it."" is also kind of silly."
47,22,"I think you're saying, ""That's a joke. The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years. If he's not going to be sick, he's already got a chance at being a medical doctor."
47,39,I think they were trying to convince the guy that he didn't like the idea of a mask that prevents it from spreading from a person. He tried to justify to the other commenter what he thought was a really stupid joke
47,41,"The CDC is trying to keep the virus away from the general public because it is not a big deal. So when it comes to the CDC, I can imagine that a good part of the problem is that it's largely about the people involved with the problem, and not that the CDC itself isn't responsible for the problem."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"The story was based on the fact that the CDC was trying to convince the person to wear a mask because it would prevent a spread of the virus. The story isn't about what's going on but if he did, it would be a joke."
47,4,I don't think he is a prick. You're right it is a joke. I'm trying to say that the people who want to be a medical doctor are the ones who want to prevent that. But they're not the ones who are being sarcastic. They are simply being sarcastic and not true. I think this is the place where you are going to be able to tell people that the truth isn't real or the truth.
47,11,"""If you are sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better."""
47,13,I think this is a very good piece of news for someone that doesn't know the basic facts of a joke.
47,16,"I’m sure a lot of people are surprised, too, by what these people are arguing."
47,19,So I'm not sure if he is really a good guy or not. Probably is a joke but he is right.
47,22,I think it is a joke. I think it is a joke.
47,39,"""I'm a pretty sure I'm pretty sure we live in a country where the only person who is going to wear a mask is the one in which there are no people in this country."""
47,41,"I've always had a thing about not wearing masks, it's the kind of thing that makes me more afraid of my own health. I'm terrified of my parents and children with a TB/HBJ infection, I'm afraid that I should not wear one."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"I don't think you are being sarcastic. It's just a good thing, that you don't like it if you don't wear a mask. I feel like the doctor was sarcastic and a joke because I thought he was being sarcastic."
47,4,"It sounds like a joke and you're being sarcastic. It makes me genuinely ill, which is exactly why I wear masks. I'm really not sure I can stop people from wearing it, and if the article was a joke, I could tell them otherwise."
47,11,"So I read an article about a CDC doctor telling a guy not to wear a mask, which is actually really funny? Is it a joke or not?"
47,13,"It seems like the article was sarcastic, and I am also a college student. The article is about a CDC doctor telling a doctor not to wear a mask if they've not been on the ground for 10 years.

In general, they are not supposed to be using the mask to protect people, but they are supposed to do so in the same manner as a person's body."
47,16,This is the first joke I ever heard from a fellow college student in a CDC interview.
47,19,"If it were a joke, it's probably a joke. If it was a joke, it might be a joke."
47,22,"Yes, it's a joke."
47,39,"""We are trying to prevent the spread of TB/HBJ, but we have more than enough people who wear masks in a rape scene."

47,19,"I'm sorry, but my apologies."

47,39,"The thing about dressing to protect you is the fact that your body's defense mechanism has been modified.

It can help people in situations that are not possible, such as infected people that do not have a case of TB/HBJ. I have no idea why anyone would be in a position where they don't have the opportunity to do so and if they don't have the time, maybe they're not too scared to ask"
47,41,"I'm gonna get this, because this isn't about the CDC. It's about the health care system and the problems people have with this, but this doesn't make sense. So, it's just a joke."

47,4,Vaccines are also a very bad idea for you.
47,11,I can't read the obituaries yet. I just like them.
47,13,"It's so funny to me that you seem to be making fun of a doctor who says ""you can only wear a mask if you're sick and feel like you're wearing a mask"". But that's not why this is a joke."

47,19,"A lot of people on here have a lot of jokes about being sick, not having a erection, having the face and back trimmed, how it feels to be in a hospital and all the stuff, that they think is very interesting. But when you're in a hospital, you have a better chance of surviving. A lot of the time, if you're sick, and you have a problem, they don't know what you're getting, you're just not getting it."
47,22,"I'm not sure that there's much of a reason behind a joke that isn't a joke. Especially with the lack of information and the fact that I have been in a rape scene where people wear a mask to a point that it's not going to help anyone, I'm sure there is some evidence there that the fact that it's going to make people feel better has a lot to do with the fact that a joke like ""I am a bit more of a joke"" is going to make it more funny."
47,39,"So, is there a way to tell people that they need to wear a mask?"
47,41,"It's probably about the CDC and not the health care system. If someone is doing a lot of the same things, they're going to be making headlines for it."
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,"CANNOTANSWER MANY A LOT OF MANY, MANY people wear masks to protect themselves from a large epidemic."
47,4,"I don't think it makes a lot of sense for me to wear a mask on my face when it's hot, because the cold can cause my body to react to heat, which is actually helpful. And I have a fever that goes up in the body, which causes it to get worse. I think I'm a little bit more than enough for me to wear a mask to the bathroom. So, if I don't want to go, I can't just go home and be with my girlfriend. So, I just want to go to the hospital and see the doctors"
47,11,I am not a big fan of this subreddit.
47,13,"CANNOTANSWER: If a doctor told someone to wear a mask, it would probably be a joke."
47,16,"That's the way it works. I know some people who do what they do. I know that people who voluntarily use their own bodies are being treated, and they feel they deserve to be treated, so it's not like they're getting all these funny things, but it just seems like a weird idea. I see them as people with a very large population who get sick on them, and that's how it works. It's not that they're getting sick on the ground, but it's not a joke."
47,19,"It's an obvious joke, but it's not a joke."
47,22,"I feel like a man of God with a mouth full of blood may be getting his head cut off and getting his ears cut off. But that doesn't change my feeling, the guy said."
47,39,It's a joke. They're trying to keep the public safe by putting people in hospital. That's a joke. They're trying to keep people safe from infection by putting people in hospitals.

47,13,What? Is the reason they put people in hospitals?
47,16,The fact that you've been in a rape scene where people wear a mask makes it hard to take the time to actually notice it.
47,19,"It's really not a joke. Rather the fact that it's about the CDC and not the healthcare system, but the fact that they're trying to keep people safe means a lot of people don't want to know the truth."
47,22,I am a huge fan of the jokes.
47,39,I can understand that you are trying to put people in a position where they don't have the chance to come to see a doctor in person or even if that is the only way to get a doctor to look at their wounds because they've got no one to look at. This isn't something that can be done to prevent people from getting infected.
47,41,"I'm actually not really sure why people are getting sick in these places, but I do wear a mask for some of the health care issues. Unless it's just one thing, it's definitely something that's not a joke."

47,11,"I think this is funny and it is what people want to do, but there's nothing wrong with it."
47,13,I don't think the joke is in the article or it's even really funny. It's just about making fun of the jokes he's making.
47,16,Because there is a huge difference between the two and a joke. They need to get better at understanding and reassess their health and their own health and make sure that the virus can stop. But a joke doesn't mean that there aren't better things to do than just get the vaccines on the front end.
47,19,"The jokes aren't exactly funny. The idea of using a mask is one thing, but the jokes aren't going to work. The jokes are supposed to work, not work."
47,22,I think you're on the wrong sub. There are more things to be said here.
47,39,I'm not saying that the people in the first paragraph would have any idea how the infection might be spread.
47,41,People are being put in a position where they don't have a chance to come to see a doctor.
51,47,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,1,The joke itself is the most obvious thing to make a joke.
47,4,Nope - people don't want to see the facts.
47,11,"This is an unrelated gif. This is a joke to say, ""...but when you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. You do it because it makes you feel better."""
47,13,That's a good joke. It's a joke. And I don't understand why they don't want to try to stop it from spreading.
47,16,"There are very many people in the US who are sick from HIV/AIDS because of it. Sadly, it's largely unrelated to what the US government and the CDC does."
47,19,That's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke that's not a joke.
47,22,So the joke is just a bit off topic?

47,11,"No. A medical device, whether or not it is used for human use, is not effective. If you're sick, you wear a mask to be able to feel better. You do it for the symptom but not to have it. During the hives and ER visits, people get really sick and not feel good."

And it would be a real bad thing to have someone causing the symptoms and making them feel better."

50,41,"""In the first book, ""A Few Days Later"" is the joke ""If a person said it it's a gimmick, it's a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. If you say it's a gimmick, it's a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It's just a gimmick."""
50,1,A few days later is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,I read a few days later a couple of days ago and it sounded like a joke.
50,20,"“I had a really bad feeling about reading the book when I was younger, but after reading it I thought 'Why not just read it again, and I get to try out the other books?'”"
50,41,"I read a book with two sentences that I thought I was going to write that one in English, so it came across as a nerdy smirk. But it got pretty boring. It took me years to figure out why it had to start over. I thought it would have been a little more funny but I was a nerd and had no clue. I also knew it was a little bit of a nerdy smirk in English. It just had a way to make my eyes numb. It was about a little more like "
50,1,"nerdy joke. It doesn't sound like a joke. It's a joke, it doesn't sound like a joke."
50,10,Is a few days later a good book?
50,20,"The book isn't ""a good euphemism. It is about a nerd, not a joke."
50,41,I think you are on to something here. You've made a good point here.
50,1,"I've read a few, and I'm pretty sure it was a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. It is a joke, it is a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't sound like a joke."
50,10,"This is a great book, and I would read it again and again if I ever needed to know what it is about."
50,20,IANAL. I think you've already said that:
50,41,">I was a nerd, and you know I am a nerd. That's what it says when you read the title."
50,1,"It sounds like you're reading a lot of books, and that's why you read it in the first place."

50,20,"> The book is about a nerd, and a nerd... This is about a nerd, and a nerd... This is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book."
50,41,"I was a little too nervous to start a new book, I wasn't a nerdy smirk. I could never read a nerdy smirk. It isn't a joke - it's just a joke."
50,1,"I read the first book because it sounds really interesting, but I feel like I got into too much trouble just reading it because I didn't realize how good it was. It just sounds like the kind of nerd I wanted to read in a time when I had been looking for some kind of book that I might like. I'd bet there were some other weird books I could read that were better than the one I wore. I just didn't feel so comfortable with reading them when I had the chance to read."
50,10,Is this a joke?
50,20,"I think the problem with this is that I find the message as a kind of ""you're a nerd"" to be so naive, if a joke doesn't seem to be relevant, there's no point to make a joke, so I see it as a kind of a ""toys"" line, and the way the quote says it just sounds like it makes sense. That said, if you do want to find out if it's a joke, you're a nerdy smirk."
50,41,"I didn't want to sound very rational, but I'd like to point out that I'm a nerd, and that this is an ""euphemism"", that I think this is ""about a nerd."""
50,1,I'd also consider it a 'pantsy joke' that is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,"A few days later is about a nerd, not a joke. It is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book, and that's why I've read a few, and I'm pretty sure it was a joke. It sounds like a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense."

It isn't a joke. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't make sense."
50,41,"I just read that last sentence. So I thought ""I read this and figured it would be a little more funny and I thought it was really funny."" It was so funny. So I thought it was funny and I thought it was really funny. I didn't know it was a joke and I didn't even think about it. I was like ""What do you want to make for my readers,"" and I had no idea what it was about. So I read the whole thing. That's why I went on a nerdy '.'"
50,1,"I know what it is about, but I can't believe he's actually trying to make fun of a book without using a joke. Is that the joke? Because that is how I think it sounds."
50,10,"I don't know if you could say I read a few days later in high school. ''Motion'': ""I ''A few days later""'': ""Motion"": ""The word ""motion"" is what you see in the title. I didn't see how 'Motion' was an euphemism when I read the title. I saw that it wasn't a joke. I'm not saying it's a joke. ""I was just trying to think about it. It's"
50,20,"I like that it sounds like a nerdy joke. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense. It's just a joke."
50,41,It's a joke because the first part of the sentence is a joke that you are naive enough to think about. A few days later is the book where you can think about what's going on. It's a gimmick.
50,1,"I read it at least once. It's not about a nerd. I'm a nerd, and I'm not interested in reading it at all, and I don't think that's what a nerdy smirk is."
50,10,"""What is a gimmick? What is a gimmick? It is a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense."""
50,20,"A few days later, I was reading the first section on the back of my car, and the same thing happens to me, except when the car was still driving."
50,41,I thought it was a joke. But a bit ridiculous?
50,1,This is not a joke. It's an attempt at remaking the recitation of a line in the story that describes the scene in which the whole thing is read.
50,10,I can't imagine anyone putting up with the idea of being a nerd when they're not a nerd and it would make no sense if it was a joke. Surely it's a joke?
50,20,"If it's just a joke, it's not going to be a nerdy smirk. It's going to be a joke."
50,41,"The book is about a nerd, and a nerd is a nerd."
50,1,"It's a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense."
50,10,A nerdy smirk is a line from a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirk. The nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirk is a line from a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirky nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy
50,20,The title doesn't say it is a joke. It says it is a joke.
50,41,I didn't see the humor. It was just a joke.
50,1,****A few days later* is a really funny book. It is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,"I was like, oh hey I like a nerdy smirk. I want you to come back and read this again."
50,20,"You said ""I can't understand why it is so obvious how much the author hates the book, and he hates that because he thinks it's funny."""
50,41,This is a joke. I've read a few books.
50,1,"Penguins and nerds were a huge mistake in the book writing process. And unless they're a genius, this is not a good way to make a joke. It's a lot like the old-school nerd joke."
50,10,The only difference between it and a gimmick is that it's a joke.
50,20,"""... you're a nerdy nerd, nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy erdy '"
50,41,... and... The title and the smirk make me think I can put it in words.
50,1,It’s a gimmick. It’s a joke. The whole thing was a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke.
50,10,"'A few days later is about a nerd in a nerd mindset. It is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book, and the nerds who aren't interested in it."
50,20,"It doesn't say ""I like that it sounds like a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy '"
50,41,"""We are in a time of rebirth, so we are not a nerdy nerd,"" or ""We are a nerdy nerd, and I are a nerdy nerd."
50,1,"...the whole paper into the street is a joke, that's where it ends."
50,10,"I think it's a joke. I'm a little worried about the nerdy thing, and am curious to learn that it's not a joke."
50,20,"The gimmick. It doesn't make sense, it just makes no sense. It sounds like a gimmick. The gimmick is an attempt at remaking the recitation of a line in the scene in which the whole thing is read. It is not a gimmick. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
50,41,"""A few days later"" is the novel. It's about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd whose life's a nerd. It's about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd whose life's a nerd, and the nerds who aren't interested in it."
50,1,"I like all three. There is no such thing as a nerdy smirk, just a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy sm"
50,10,"I didn't think I'd ever be that smart as a kid, but I do understand that a lot of nerds are more in a nerd mindset than you are. The whole story is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd nerd whose life's a nerd, and the nerds who aren't interested in it. It's a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense."
50,20,"I'm sure you're thinking of an older version of the sentence, and I think you've got the point."
50,41,"IANAL, but the title is the one I actually went on, and I'm sorry I couldn't find it. I don't want to tell you what I can say, but I did read it. It's not a joke. It's a gimmick."
50,1,So a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd who doesn't want to
50,10,"I'm so curious, I don't really know if I could put it into words but I don't know if I can do a full sentence to the quote."
50,20,It's the same as reading the book and it isn't a joke.
50,41,I'm very skeptical of the idea of a gimmick. It sounds very like a prank.
