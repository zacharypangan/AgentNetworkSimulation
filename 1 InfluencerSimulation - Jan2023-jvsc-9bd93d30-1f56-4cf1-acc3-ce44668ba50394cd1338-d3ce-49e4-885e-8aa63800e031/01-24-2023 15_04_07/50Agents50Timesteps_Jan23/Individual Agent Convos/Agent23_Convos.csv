29,23,this guy is garbage and utah needs to get rid of him gitmo would be a good place for him gop sen mitt romney votes with democrats to keep masks mandate for toddlers
30,23,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable

45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"It seems like he isn't really getting the message from congress, because it sounds like he is. He is an asshole and he can't help you. The only reason you could be able to pull this off is to go into a secluded area and ask for assistance from the police or a witness. It's not like it's working for you and not a good idea, but if he's the one who is trying to help you with it, you should do it."
23,11,What he is doing is shaming a guy that was actually an anti-fap leader.
23,12,I would hate to go out to the grocery store and say that the next time I have a new and new friend I would do the same thing!
29,23,"I don't see why the mask mandate isn't lifted and a few weeks away for most of us why do people keep asking this yes i have had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
30,23,"I think the first time you get sick from a mask is with a gun, you don't wear one. I always do when i'm sick, because of the mask, I like to wear them for a few days. And then my face gets hot and uncomfortable as well. I would hate to be vaccinated, but for someone who is sick and would be too old to wear a mask in the first place. I eat a lot of food and drink all the time, and I wear a mask every day."
32,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,It's a joke.
23,11,I've been bitten in the neck by an airborne bacteria and it's hard to tell if it's virus or not. I can't tell if it's a bad sign that I'm an anti-fap leader or not.
23,12,"It doesn't seem like the mask mandate isn't lifted. This is an overreaction, and not only is it ridiculous, it's an overreaction. There are no laws against getting sick from a mask. They are laws for doing drugs. And that is a part of it."
29,23,It's not like he's saying that he has no idea why he's not on the bill.
30,23,So many people are vaccinated  and how do you get vaccinated?
32,23,This is probably my favorite quote of all time.

23,1,"The fact that he's bringing the issue up is outrageous. He's not a good friend, he's a dick. He's not a funny person."
23,11,This is one of those times where it's pretty obvious that the mask mandate is being ignored by Congress.
23,12,"There is a real, serious threat of inhaling a drug in your body."
29,23,The idea of having a public healthcare system isn't just a virus. It's a virus. Vaccinations are a vaccine.
30,23,I don't believe the CDC was just mentioning it.
32,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I like to wear a mask every night and I love them."
45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"i have a bit of a different opinion - if your friend doesn't want to wear a mask and you don't feel comfortable putting them on in the morning, it's probably good practice to just wear them because you feel sick in the morning but haven't been around for a long time. but that's because he's an asshole. he should have been able to tell you not to put them on. i'm a big believer that they're the ones afk."
23,11,He's the one doing the mask mandate. This is outrageous.
23,12,Vaccinations are a vaccine.
29,23,I have a lot of time for this discussion. I always wondered how a guy who has had a mask will be able to get out of a mask if he can get to the point of having the virus spread.
30,23,Vaccination is a lifelong struggle with a sick child.
32,23,"I'd rather wear a mask at a gym and not have to wear a mask, but I wouldn't wear a mask a lot."
45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,Vaccinations are a vaccine. The idea of having a public healthcare system isn't just a virus. It's a virus. Vaccinations are a vaccine.
23,11,I never wear a mask when I'm sick because of the virus. I want it to be removed because it can spread and makes me feel better.
23,12,I feel like I read a lot more of your comments.

23,11,"I don't think he cares what you think, he's just a troll. I think he's just being an asshole and the mask mandate is going to be outlawed, which is probably why he's taking it at face value :: 'I think the only way for the mandate to be lifted is to allow a person to put a mask on themselves....and...And it's not even possible to detect the specific causes of the virus. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and"
23,12,This is one of those times where it's pretty obvious that the mask mandate is being ignored by Congress.
29,23,"Vaccinations are a vaccine. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask to prevent a vaccine from spreading into the lungs. This prevents a vaccine from causing it to spread. You are correct that they are useless and a vaccine doesn't stop the virus, even if it can be detected and removed. I know you're having an extreme opinion on this, but I have an opinion on the virus."
30,23,Vaccination is a lifelong struggle with a sick child.

23,11,"He's being a bit of a dick. I'm not a big fan of him, I hate to put on my mask if I'm sick. It's pretty ridiculous that he's not just a dick. I like to wear a mask everyday and I hate it."
23,12,It’s ridiculous how it’s used to cover everyone. I’ve been a medical professional.
29,23,You just made an unhelpful comment. Then yelled at someone when they asked you to do something about it and didn't answer. I think you were genuinely trying to make a point that your comments would be useful. You have no idea how much of a job a man is. How do you feel about it if he is denying you a job.
30,23,You're being sarcastic. Then you are trying to point out that you don't understand the meaning of your post and that you can't accept my sentiments as fact.
32,23,"I would hate to be the first to say the ""It's not funny"" in a comment because I'm pretty sure it's a joke, but that's an awful thing to say."

23,12,I always put on a mask when I was sick. I want to be there.

23,11,"In general, they're just not racist at all."
23,12,I love you. You are a good person.
29,23,"I really like the ""What do you think about it?"" jokes in this movie. I don't understand why people feel like it's about ""racists"", I'm just trying to make fun of people who've gotten sick of seeing hats and hats and aren't aware of the whole ""fuck it is a fetish"" thing and I don't understand why the ""fuck it is a big fetish"" thing isn't about the president's policies."
30,23,"A few months ago a friend of mine got sick from wearing a hat hat hat in my car. It was the first thing on her face after she had died, so it didn't really make much sense. I'm still trying to understand why someone would not want to wear one."

23,12,I'm so sorry but I'm tired of that.
29,23,There's no way I would be able to tell you why you wouldn't want to wear a mask. It's just an idea.
30,23,I don't know why I would think wearing a hat with the hat on to the CDC is a joke. I think that the people who are trying to portray it as a good idea.
32,23,It is ridiculous. People just try to get into a rut and that's it.
45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,I am a nurse and I have been able to find a couple of ways to get rid of these jokes. You are my friend.

The only thing they care about is their own health care system. The more they try to push the mask mandate on, the more they feel like they're trying to be racist. The mask mandate isn't just a "

If it does, I don’t see how it can be a good idea. I don’t understand why people think that we should have a sicker system and the masks isn’t useful. There isn’t anything that works, and nobody is trying to figure out what that is."
30,23,The most important thing for us here is the joke.
32,23,It's a sub-reddit.

23,1,Vaccinations are a vaccine. The CDC recommends that people wear a mask when they're sick. You want it removed because it can spread and makes you feel better. I’m going to go ahead and say.

23,12,"My friend is in the CDC office that is doing the public health care, and a lot of the other doctors are out there as well. The CDC isn’t on board with that, and a lot of the doctors have been doing it in public."
29,23,"It is a blatant violation of the law in the state of 'unhealthy' America. It is a blatant violation of the law in the state of 'unhealthy' America, 'that's why we don't get a good public health care."
30,23,"A lot of hats (particularly the “hell hat” type) are hats, they aren’t always worn on the face and only worn on the ears. It can’t help, but it will stop them from using it to get a shot at the sun."
32,23,I hate how the sarcasm and sarcastic parts of this post.
45,23,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"The CDC should be in charge of the vaccine. That should be a priority for everyone, especially those who are allergic to it."
23,11,"i think the reason i read this comment is because they feel that the CDC is not doing anything to protect people who are sick because they need something they can say about what's going on, because'she's being a troll and is being an asshole'"
23,12,"It's a very serious issue. I want to be in charge of the CDC so that they can use it as a tool to prevent and treat people from spreading a viral infection. And it has been in place for decades. I've been in the CDC for 12 years, and I'm in the CDC for a few years now. I don't want to be in the CDC. I don't want to have to deal with the mask mandate."
29,23,The hat is on my back. It can't stop my hair.

23,12,"A very common joke in the medical community is that the mask mandate is being pushed on too much. That's why it gets so bad, and is just a joke."
29,23,... and that's how my mother told me to leave me with her hat.

23,1,The CDC would need to pass a law to change that law. This is exactly the kind of law that the majority of people in the medical profession hate. It's a blatant violation of the 'war on drugs' law.
23,11,"Honestly I feel like it's just a joke, and it's pretty uncool, but you can't make this one a joke."
