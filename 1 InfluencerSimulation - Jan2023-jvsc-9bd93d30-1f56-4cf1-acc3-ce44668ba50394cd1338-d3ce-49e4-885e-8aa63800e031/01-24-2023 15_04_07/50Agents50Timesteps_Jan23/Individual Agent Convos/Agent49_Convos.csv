49,14,"I figured they were referring to the ""hat"". I think hats are meant to be the best way to express how warm things are in the context of a movie. I think people think that they are so hot that it's not funny and just feel uncomfortable in the way they are. That's just a common occurrence."

49,34,I've actually seen a bunch of the hats. I love hats. I also have a lot of the hats I like. But I can't eat those. I can't even eat a hat. I can't even put myself in hats.

49,14,"And then we go on to the next episode where a person is asked, 'What do you do for a living? I think you have a problem?'"
49,16,"I was going to go out and look for some hats in a store, I just wasn't sure how that would be a good way to tell me what the hat is for."
49,19,"I read the subreddit a few times. It was interesting to read about it. It's the kind of stuff that makes people feel uncomfortable in hats and movies.
