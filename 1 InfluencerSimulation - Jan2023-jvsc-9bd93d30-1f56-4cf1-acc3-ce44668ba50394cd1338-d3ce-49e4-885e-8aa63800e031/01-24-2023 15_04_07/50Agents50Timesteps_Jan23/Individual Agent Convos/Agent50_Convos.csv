50,1,"The book is about the nerd, a nerd, and a nerd..."
50,10,This is about a nerd in a nerd mindset. It's the kind of thing you're looking for in a book.
50,20,CANNOTANSWER UP THE YETTER?
50,41,I thought it was a good euphemism.
50,1,"A few days later is about a nerd, not a joke."
50,10,"My favorite line is: ""This is a good book. It is about a nerd, not a joke. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It's a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It's just a joke. It's a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. The idea that this is a gimmick, doesn't appeal to me."""
50,20,Is that a good euphemism? I thought it was a good euphemism.
50,41,"""In the first book, ""A Few Days Later"" is the joke ""If a person said it it's a gimmick, it's a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. If you say it's a gimmick, it's a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It's just a gimmick."""
50,1,A few days later is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,I read a few days later a couple of days ago and it sounded like a joke.
50,20,"“I had a really bad feeling about reading the book when I was younger, but after reading it I thought 'Why not just read it again, and I get to try out the other books?'”"
50,41,"I read a book with two sentences that I thought I was going to write that one in English, so it came across as a nerdy smirk. But it got pretty boring. It took me years to figure out why it had to start over. I thought it would have been a little more funny but I was a nerd and had no clue. I also knew it was a little bit of a nerdy smirk in English. It just had a way to make my eyes numb. It was about a little more like "
50,1,"nerdy joke. It doesn't sound like a joke. It's a joke, it doesn't sound like a joke."
50,10,Is a few days later a good book?
50,20,"The book isn't ""a good euphemism. It is about a nerd, not a joke."
50,41,I think you are on to something here. You've made a good point here.
50,1,"I've read a few, and I'm pretty sure it was a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. It is a joke, it is a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't sound like a joke."
50,10,"This is a great book, and I would read it again and again if I ever needed to know what it is about."
50,20,IANAL. I think you've already said that:
50,41,">I was a nerd, and you know I am a nerd. That's what it says when you read the title."
50,1,"It sounds like you're reading a lot of books, and that's why you read it in the first place."
50,10,"""A Few Days Later"" is ""about a nerd, not a joke. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't make sense."""
50,20,"> The book is about a nerd, and a nerd... This is about a nerd, and a nerd... This is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book."
50,41,"I was a little too nervous to start a new book, I wasn't a nerdy smirk. I could never read a nerdy smirk. It isn't a joke - it's just a joke."
50,1,"I read the first book because it sounds really interesting, but I feel like I got into too much trouble just reading it because I didn't realize how good it was. It just sounds like the kind of nerd I wanted to read in a time when I had been looking for some kind of book that I might like. I'd bet there were some other weird books I could read that were better than the one I wore. I just didn't feel so comfortable with reading them when I had the chance to read."
50,10,Is this a joke?
50,20,"I think the problem with this is that I find the message as a kind of ""you're a nerd"" to be so naive, if a joke doesn't seem to be relevant, there's no point to make a joke, so I see it as a kind of a ""toys"" line, and the way the quote says it just sounds like it makes sense. That said, if you do want to find out if it's a joke, you're a nerdy smirk."
50,41,"I didn't want to sound very rational, but I'd like to point out that I'm a nerd, and that this is an ""euphemism"", that I think this is ""about a nerd."""
50,1,I'd also consider it a 'pantsy joke' that is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,"A few days later is about a nerd, not a joke. It is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book, and that's why I've read a few, and I'm pretty sure it was a joke. It sounds like a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense."
50,20,"That's a good point - I think the problem with this is that I find the message as a kind of ""you're a nerd"" to be so naive, if a joke doesn't seem to be relevant, there's no point to make a joke, so I see it as a kind of ""toys"" line, and the way the quote says it just sounds like it makes sense. It isn't a joke. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't make sense."
50,41,"I just read that last sentence. So I thought ""I read this and figured it would be a little more funny and I thought it was really funny."" It was so funny. So I thought it was funny and I thought it was really funny. I didn't know it was a joke and I didn't even think about it. I was like ""What do you want to make for my readers,"" and I had no idea what it was about. So I read the whole thing. That's why I went on a nerdy '.'"
50,1,"I know what it is about, but I can't believe he's actually trying to make fun of a book without using a joke. Is that the joke? Because that is how I think it sounds."
50,10,"I don't know if you could say I read a few days later in high school. ''Motion'': ""I ''A few days later""'': ""Motion"": ""The word ""motion"" is what you see in the title. I didn't see how 'Motion' was an euphemism when I read the title. I saw that it wasn't a joke. I'm not saying it's a joke. ""I was just trying to think about it. It's"
50,20,"I like that it sounds like a nerdy joke. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense. It's just a joke."
50,41,It's a joke because the first part of the sentence is a joke that you are naive enough to think about. A few days later is the book where you can think about what's going on. It's a gimmick.
50,1,"I read it at least once. It's not about a nerd. I'm a nerd, and I'm not interested in reading it at all, and I don't think that's what a nerdy smirk is."
50,10,"""What is a gimmick? What is a gimmick? It is a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense. It is a gimmick, but it doesn't have to make sense."""
50,20,"A few days later, I was reading the first section on the back of my car, and the same thing happens to me, except when the car was still driving."
50,41,I thought it was a joke. But a bit ridiculous?
50,1,This is not a joke. It's an attempt at remaking the recitation of a line in the story that describes the scene in which the whole thing is read.
50,10,I can't imagine anyone putting up with the idea of being a nerd when they're not a nerd and it would make no sense if it was a joke. Surely it's a joke?
50,20,"If it's just a joke, it's not going to be a nerdy smirk. It's going to be a joke."
50,41,"The book is about a nerd, and a nerd is a nerd."
50,1,"It's a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense."
50,10,A nerdy smirk is a line from a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirk. The nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirk is a line from a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy smirky nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy
50,20,The title doesn't say it is a joke. It says it is a joke.
50,41,I didn't see the humor. It was just a joke.
50,1,****A few days later* is a really funny book. It is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd whose life's a nerd and the nerds who aren't interested in it.
50,10,"I was like, oh hey I like a nerdy smirk. I want you to come back and read this again."
50,20,"You said ""I can't understand why it is so obvious how much the author hates the book, and he hates that because he thinks it's funny."""
50,41,This is a joke. I've read a few books.
50,1,"Penguins and nerds were a huge mistake in the book writing process. And unless they're a genius, this is not a good way to make a joke. It's a lot like the old-school nerd joke."
50,10,The only difference between it and a gimmick is that it's a joke.
50,20,"""... you're a nerdy nerd, nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy erdy '"
50,41,... and... The title and the smirk make me think I can put it in words.
50,1,It’s a gimmick. It’s a joke. The whole thing was a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke.
50,10,"'A few days later is about a nerd in a nerd mindset. It is about the kind of thing you're looking for in a book, and the nerds who aren't interested in it."
50,20,"It doesn't say ""I like that it sounds like a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy '"
50,41,"""We are in a time of rebirth, so we are not a nerdy nerd,"" or ""We are a nerdy nerd, and I are a nerdy nerd."
50,1,"...the whole paper into the street is a joke, that's where it ends."
50,10,"I think it's a joke. I'm a little worried about the nerdy thing, and am curious to learn that it's not a joke."
50,20,"The gimmick. It doesn't make sense, it just makes no sense. It sounds like a gimmick. The gimmick is an attempt at remaking the recitation of a line in the scene in which the whole thing is read. It is not a gimmick. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
50,41,"""A few days later"" is the novel. It's about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd whose life's a nerd. It's about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd whose life's a nerd, and the nerds who aren't interested in it."
50,1,"I like all three. There is no such thing as a nerdy smirk, just a nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy nerdy sm"
50,10,"I didn't think I'd ever be that smart as a kid, but I do understand that a lot of nerds are more in a nerd mindset than you are. The whole story is about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd nerd whose life's a nerd, and the nerds who aren't interested in it. It's a joke, but it doesn't have to make sense."
50,20,"I'm sure you're thinking of an older version of the sentence, and I think you've got the point."
50,41,"IANAL, but the title is the one I actually went on, and I'm sorry I couldn't find it. I don't want to tell you what I can say, but I did read it. It's not a joke. It's a gimmick."
50,1,So a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a book about a nerd who reads a novel about a nerd who doesn't want to
50,10,"I'm so curious, I don't really know if I could put it into words but I don't know if I can do a full sentence to the quote."
50,20,It's the same as reading the book and it isn't a joke.
50,41,I'm very skeptical of the idea of a gimmick. It sounds very like a prank.
