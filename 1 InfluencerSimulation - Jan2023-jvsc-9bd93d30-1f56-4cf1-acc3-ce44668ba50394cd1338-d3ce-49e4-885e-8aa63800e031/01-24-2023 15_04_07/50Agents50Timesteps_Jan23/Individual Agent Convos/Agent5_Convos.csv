32,5,"It's not really funny, but the word is used in references, and is not necessarily relevant. For some reason, this isn't relevant, as in, ""Get the body if you see it.

28,5,I'm not a lawyer but I would be a lawyer. This isn't an argument about the ACA. I don't want to be a lawyer. It's a misunderstanding of what we're saying. We're talking about the ACA versus Obamacare. We're talking about the Bushcare. We want to be involved in Obamacare. It's not a matter of 'took a long time to get vaccinated'.

28,5,'I feel like your parents would get a big bang from that. What's a fetus? Does it have the specific genetic causes of the virus? I've seen this documentary and am amazed at the amount of answers that people give to the mask mandate. You're just a whiner. You're just a whiner. You don't get to see the movie.
32,5,"I feel like I just can't tell you a story without talking to you. I think the idea of a new mask is pretty interesting.

17,5,"I don't think the ACA was passed because it's about a single rule in the Constitution that mandates the ""fake"" shave, and I don't think any more will be passed than that. This is a very important fact for a lot of people to take into consideration."
28,5,I'm afraid to be a lawyer... I'd say that the mask mandate should be removed as it doesn't actually protect you from the virus. The fact that people are getting a huge rap about this is a huge red flag.
32,5,"No wonder you're so incredibly remorseful that you feel like you can't tell a story without talking to a few people, just because you can't."

17,5,I've read all the responses and I've seen the comment that makes me believe this is a legitimate question and I don't have to think a lot about why this isn't being ratified.

17,5,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a little shocked they don't even have a video of this guy wearing a mask..."", ""I think if we eat more chicken, we're not going to stop drinking."" They should get a doctor. A school counselor wouldn't allow a girl to get vaccinations without having to be a teacher. Vaccinations aren't going to help them avoid an actual school, so they could try and keep the kids and parents safe."
28,5,I like it because it shows that the government is making some of the most harmful policies around. Vaccination is a real health issue and some people will be worried about the state and the federal government doing the same things that are wrong. There are some people that are not aware of the full extent of the problem.
32,5,I don't see a reason to have this type of conversation.
39,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,5,"I'm pretty sure I was wrong, but I did not think that I could repeal it if voted against it. The ACA was repealed a few years ago because the government has no say on it. I didn't think it was a big deal if it was repealed."

17,5,I think this is an amazing nitpick from a great journalist.
28,5,"I don't see why he would think the current bill would be implemented because it is politically motivated, and it would be more difficult for him to justify the fact that it is the only option for the US to get on the ballot. I don't know, I know, I have heard some bad news on it a number of times, but this has not helped me with anything. I'm very glad I was prevented from participating in this conversation, and I hope you have a great day!"

13,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,5,"In this context, the government was trying to help people get vaccinated, but a woman had a mask on. A woman's doctor told her she could get a mask and a girl's doctor wouldn't allow her to get the vaccines, but the government has failed to help her. The idea is absurd, and the government has not tried to stop this because of it."
28,5,"I'm not sure how to say that, but if you think the GOP is going to be banned from the House, I think it would be a good idea to ban it from the House."

13,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,5,"The idea isn't even considered a requirement. That being said, it's a mandate."
28,5,"I would say that in a short time, the GOP is taking the right to be a bad defender of the rights of every citizen, irrespective of who they're the target. Essentially, it would just be more and more likely to make people feel bad and make the people in control of their own lives more concerned about their own safety than any real government decision, which would likely mean more people with no health insurance, especially in a conservative household."
32,5,I hate to be sarcastic but you're doing it wrong.
39,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

28,5,"Vaccination is important to both the patient and the government, it's also important that people keep in mind that these people are doing their own thing if they don't want to go to the doctor, or have their hands tied in case of emergency.

28,5,"It's not an argument about health care. It's a debate about health care, not about who gets to decide who gets to vote. This is not a legitimate argument for a mandate. It's a question of whether the ACA will get the trolls votes that make it bad, because of the trolls who think this would be a good idea for the GOP."
32,5,I genuinely think you are an idiot.
39,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

17,5,There is no excuse for the new healthcare mandate. You should try to do more research on the subject. The idea of an effective vaccination would be a big deal if you had to go to school. It's an example of the way people use it:

28,5,"I've seen a lot of ridiculous videos of people being dragged into it as a child, or the gov't hating on all the jokes, but I can tell you that they weren't really the hating that was the problem, not the person. If we are allowed to talk about anything else, e.g., a rape case, the hats, etc., I can see them on the hat's screen."
32,5,It is kind of a strange thing to put your finger on. You're just trying to get an emotional connection to the topic.

32,5,"I love to wear a mask. It helps me feel more alive than sarcastic, even if I'm not in a big gang situation. My first impulse was to go back to sarcastic. I was in a band and I felt like a child, I was in an actual situation. I was a big fan of it and I wanted to share my emotions with you."
