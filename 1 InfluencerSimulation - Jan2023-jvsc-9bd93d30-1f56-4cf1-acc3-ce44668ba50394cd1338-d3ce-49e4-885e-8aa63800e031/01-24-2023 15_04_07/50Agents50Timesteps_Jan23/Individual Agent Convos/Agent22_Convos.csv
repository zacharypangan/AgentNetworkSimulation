22,16,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
24,22,i did this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center
38,22,i am not wearing a mask for more months just saying
47,22,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
49,22,wearing this mask and it being so hot
22,16,I want to get out of that mask I wear.
24,22,"What did you think? You are not able to take the vaccines out of this country, you are not a fucking idiot."
38,22,"I'm sick of hearing people complain that wearing a mask for more months is not actually good or effective, though I was able to convince a friend that I am not going to go on vacation for more months just because I was sick. The guy told me that it works, but I had to be on vacation a little while ago and I can't remember the word ""medical-vaccinated"" until we reached that point."
47,22,"If you're not wearing a mask, wear a mask instead of a head, and it'll help you go to school or college"
49,22,"It is very hot, so much so hot, so much hot, so hot, too hot, too hot."
22,16,"My doctor told me that after I became sick with a viral infection for over 5 months, the first treatment I wore for the rest of my life was to take a mask off. I decided to go off because I was sick and had to put it on. Then the doctors got my face healed with a flu shot. After I had taken it off I started being ill for about 2 weeks."
24,22,"i'd probably want to go on a walk in a circle if they knew he was there, but i think the one lone maskless man is the man. he could easily be in a coma."
38,22,"The mayor of your state will probably sign a letter that says no, it's because there aren't enough funds to buy a public health mask, and the mayor knows about it. This will get to the mayor in an instant if the Mayor doesn't do this."
47,22,"A LOT of people do that. I'm sure some of them don't really understand the purpose of wearing a mask because of their mental illness. But a mask isn't the reason to go to Georgia, you're talking about Georgia not Georgia sizing up their head, but rather Georgia dressing up."
49,22,"I see your point, I'm going to make a joke. I'll give you a good explanation, please."
22,16,That's very confusing. There are also very limited benefits.
24,22,I think there is a lot of bias in how people see Obamacare because it's just a government mandate to be held by the voters of a state. I guess that's a lot of strawmen.
38,22,"The mayor of your state will probably sign a letter that says no, it's because there aren't enough funds to buy a public health mask, and the mayor knows about it. The city's vaccinating commissioner must also send a letter to the mayor explaining the reasons for the mask."
47,22,"What is a mask? And the same thing goes for wearing it when you're sick. It helps you breathe, and it also helps you feel better. I think a mask can be the key to helping people breathe better, but it doesn't mean you should just take it off and leave it on a good day."
49,22,>I really think this mask is just a way to show the warmth of a hot summer evening. It isn't the end of the world. You get so hot in there.
22,16,"They're calling the bill ""stupid, depressing and ignorant"" a ""slut, idiotic scheme"" that is being implemented."
24,22,"""... to me, they're a little uninspired but I don't really like them because a lot of people are like they are trying to wear a helmet while their doctor is talking about the mask and the mask mandate isn't lifting."""
38,22,"I think the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know. I don't see a good reason not to. A lack of a health system will get you in sick. If he's not careful, you may want to talk to the mayor about it. The mayor might feel the need to ask for a letter in the coming weeks if he's not doing something so good in the long run."

38,22,"It seems like this is more than a minor issue - the mayor of the city was probably going to have the authority to change the ACA to ""do not have a mandate"" because he was afraid of the mayor being wrong about his decision."

22,16,[Want to be vaccinated?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_Visa_Care_Report/Fact_Ration.htm). Is that a case?
24,22,I don't think you can ever go back to the people who are trying to be vaccinated.
38,22,CANNOTANSWER: The city with the most heat is wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask.
47,22,I'm sure that it's possible to put in a mask to help you get sick. But it can't help you to keep people in a state.
49,22,I was reading that and thought about how hot the hat was because he screamed and was cold.
22,16,i think the most important thing here is to keep your mouth shut and let the Mayor know.
24,22,The problem is that the government has decided to not do anything about it.
38,22,"The AMA doesn't address the actual problem here, but it addresses the question 'I don't like wearing a mask for more months'."
47,22,I don't know how to make my erection feel better but if you're sick you do it because it makes you feel better. I feel better as a result of putting in the mask because I can breathe and make people feel better.
49,22,"I'm an introvert, and while it may not be funny, it does feel uncomfortable."
22,16,"I don't understand the people complaining that wearing a mask makes them feel better, so I can't imagine anyone not trying. I've never snorted or swallowed one of those in my life. It would be very hard for me to tell what I sounded like. But it's a pity because it's like they're putting on their hats and aren't using the whole hat thing. I don't really think they'd want to get the hat thing."
24,22,So a lot of people who think he is a prick want to vaccinate because he wants the vaccines for his daughter? I wonder how many people actually want to get it?
38,22,"What is the ""Mickey Man"" thing that's always come up on reddit?"
47,22,"The first two paragraphs are a little off topic, but I'm going to give you some insight: The word ""affected"" is used to describe a person's symptoms."
49,22,I feel like this is the quickest way to get out of the first phase. It sounds like you're a total jerk. You're an introvert.
22,16,"'Well then the vaccine has to go out'. But if the mayor wants to go back to a person who wants to get vaccinated, he will have to go to the mayor 'what's up with this,' so I will be able to make up for the lack of vaccination and to a politician who hasn't seen the facts, 'but you can't see how this will work in this future'."
24,22,This sounds so much like how a guy argues that a mask is the answer to the problem.
38,22,The MMR mandate is not a problem for the government and it will make people feel that they are assholes.
47,22,"I'm afraid I'm missing the point. I think that in some places it can be helpful in the fight against the virus but I don't think it can really be effective in preventing it. Besides, my friend said that he had been in Georgia and he was scared to go there, and he didn't think it was necessary and he wasn't willing to let someone in for an X-ray."
49,22,I'm an introvert and I'm uncomfortable with the heat and the smell.
22,16,Why doesn't this be discussed in the article?
24,22,"I think the most interesting part is that the ""me too"" is a cliche, and not a resounding ""we're just trying to keep them from being a commie"" in the sense that it makes me a commie, and is ""tainted"". The fact that he's trying to explain the fact is a little disturbing."
38,22,"""I don't have to suck myself in. There's something to it that I don't get. I'd be a hat man, but I can't be that cool at a movie. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

38,22,I'm just getting here. I agree with many of those aphorisms.
47,22,I've been there many times.
49,22,"It's not a joke, it's a way to show the warmth of a summer evening."
22,16,I don't see how anyone would like to get vaccinated because they can't keep going to the doctors. If he wants to go to the doctors he needs to get to his doctor and show the doctor that he is able to do something about this. Getting vaccinated in his hometown and being able to wear a helmet in the evening is all but irrelevant.
24,22,"It's a joke that needs to be addressed. I'm confused why he's calling this a joke, it's a little over the top. I don't think the first part is cliche, but the whole idea of people being obligated to wear masks and a mask are the two most important parts. The tenth part is actually obtuse because the tenth part is literally cliche."
38,22,"I can say with certainty that a lot of people who don't like wearing masks don't like being in their hats. But it doesn't mean they have to be able to make it work. And this is a great idea, not a good one. I don't think alot of people aren't interested in it, but that's about it. The MMR mandate is just as important as the ACA because if it is repealed the majority of people want to go to the doctor or even get a vaccinated, and"

24,22,The only thing I can think about is why the US government would do something. The health care system is a very complex one. A lot of people like to keep their mouth shut.
38,22,What does [Rajma tell you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajma) mean?
47,22,There are actually a lot of reasons why you could wear a mask on someone who is sick of HIV.
49,22,[[[NAME] is a hat in the sense that it's hot to be a hat].
22,16,"... the reason people need to be on the field and be able to get up, is because they are comfortable being able to go to the doctors. This is a joke."

38,22,"“I don’t like wearing a mask because I think it’s too hot, but I've seen hot hats, it’s not that hot.”"

22,16,">'Well then the mask has to go out. But if the mayor wants to go back to a person who wants to get vaccinated, he needs to get to his doctor and show the doctor that he is able to do something about this."
24,22,I agree with you. I can understand what the ''m like saying you're in the middle of a mental breakdown where there are two problems.
38,22,>There is a LOT of jokes in this thread about hats and it doesn't really make sense for any person to be wearing a hat - unless they're about the virus and not the hat itself.

22,16,I would consider that the ''cannot be lifted'' has nothing to do with the'mama mandate''.

49,22,I hate people like this. It makes me want to see a hat.
22,16,I like to write a comic book a bit about a guy who is a bit of a douche.
24,22,I was actually surprised by the fact that the guy that wrote the hat was from a joke. I thought he thought that a guy was trying to do the best he could to save his life. He wanted to know if you guys were going to get vaccinated for his kids and if it isn't and they're going to get vaccinated. That's just a joke. The guy who wrote the hat... I can't think of any other joke that I would have told him this about the way the hats.
38,22,i'm going to go and buy a hat right now because I don't want to have a hat. It's really more than a hat.
47,22,"I think you are over-thinking it. This CDC article is a joke. It's going to make me want to go to the ER, and my gut tells me not to wear masks, and I'm going to get sick."
