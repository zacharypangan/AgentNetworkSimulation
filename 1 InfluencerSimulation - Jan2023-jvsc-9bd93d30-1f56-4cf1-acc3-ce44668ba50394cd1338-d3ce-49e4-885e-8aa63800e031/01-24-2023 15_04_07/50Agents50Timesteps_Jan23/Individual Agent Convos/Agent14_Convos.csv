49,14,wearing this mask and it being so hot

14,12,"I wear a mask, it is uncomfortable and it makes me feel uncomfortable if it's in your face, because it s really tight and uncomfortable and he's sweaty - no?"
18,14,"i was in dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
42,14,"I always wondered if people did this when I had my first exposures to an X-ray. Then I discovered that they could not find that information online. I had no clue what I was doing, so I just assumed it was just a lie. They couldn't find anything else to do other than say something like ""Nobody's got to be out there in the next hour"". That's how I found it."
48,14,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,14,"It is hot for the longest time, I've always loved the heat – I can't wait to show up in the hot sun for a walk"
14,4,I always wondered if people did this when I had my first exposures to an X-ray.
14,12,A guy has been sweating and it was so bad that he could walk away and not think about being covered and I think he needed a new mask.
18,14,a bad mask does not prevent the virus and if you wear a mask it can stop the spores from spreading.
42,14,I always wondered if people did this when I had my first exposures to an X-ray.
48,14,"I've always wanted to use my mask to kill the virus. It was a pain in the ass but it's worth it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,14,"I am actually a fan of this movie. It's a funny movie about a'snazzy' snazzy guy that's a fan of the ""smokey"" type thing (he is 'cool' and I am very comfortable with it, I love the way it is) and is kind of cool."
14,4,That was actually a really fun movie.
14,12,This is the first movie I ever watched. It was really hilarious and I'm pretty sure most people would get sick and get some serious burns and other signs.
18,14,"OP, the CDC has found that the presence of the virus is important enough that they should make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not ""infecting anybody else"" - ""infecting anyone else."""
42,14,"Well the first time someone asks me for advice I ask ""do you have a doctor?"" (they always ask for a doctor and a doctor can always tell me who they are if I've been exposed to any osmotic virus)."
48,14,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,14,"The guy with the hotness of a hat is hot on that one. It's hot on that one. And if he doesn't like it, he's just an immature snob who does, you know, a good comedy."
14,4,"The CDC has found that the presence of the virus is important enough that they should make it mandatory to wear a mask. It's not ""infecting anybody else"" - ""infecting anyone else."""
14,12,You can make a joke like this if you don't put them on. It's the only way to do it.
18,14,"If it was a good idea to put a mask on people, it'd be a joke."
42,14,"My friend and I were both in high school. It was very helpful. It worked so well and I had to do some basic stuff as I learned to not take too much time out, so she didn't feel bad. It was very helpful that she had that type of mask. She'd get over it and talk about it to me later and I just started talking about it to my friends when she was older."
48,14,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,14,"It's a lot easier when you are uncomfortable in hot clothes. I'm not saying it isn't cool, but I think it's an apt description of the premise of the movie, I think."
14,4,They have found it is really important to wear a mask. 'Some of these people's face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days'.
14,12,"I'm so excited to see this movie. I can't believe I've heard the whole story: I just have a cold, and my hair gets so saggy and my face isn't cool!"
18,14,"I hate it. When I think I'm in danger of getting an infection, I think of these jokes as... ""If you can't see a mask doesn't prevent the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
42,14,What is a virus? That's so true. Because it's not really a virus and it doesn't help prevent any other infection. It is an inflammatory and infected disease that can be spread to anyone.
48,14,"> I like you. I love you. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,14,I don't even really get why people are arguing the hotness of a hat is funny. It's just not funny. It's just a joke. And it's not funny.
14,4,That's probably what's going on in this thread. Apparently this is not the movie I wanted to watch because it was a really fun movie.
14,12,It is not cool for someone to think they are the same person but if they are the same. If someone is the same as you and you start seeing it then you are still a different person
18,14,"I don't like hating this thing. I think the message of the ""masked mandate"" is that people are being pissed and not resigning because the aphids are showing up."

48,14,"I've been wearing a mask for 10 years. I like you, I love you, and you're all cool and cool and I love you too!"
49,14,"I think the hat is just an ideal for the situation. There is nothing bad about it, it just seems not suitable. I think a lot of people don't like the hat and there's nothing funny about the actual clothing. But it's a good comedy."
14,4,I don't understand how people can come up with something so silly like that. I can't even imagine being out in public wearing something like that...
14,12,"I've been wearing my mask for 10 years, and I like it so much that I still don't know why people don't wear it."

18,14,"Basically, ""I wear a mask to prevent the CDC from preventing people from getting sick""."
42,14,">The person who asked ""do you have a doctor?"" should have said: ""Didn't I know someone who hasn't had multiple exposures? I can't imagine how I'd feel to think it's possible to diagnose people with a virus?"" That's what they are trying to get across."
