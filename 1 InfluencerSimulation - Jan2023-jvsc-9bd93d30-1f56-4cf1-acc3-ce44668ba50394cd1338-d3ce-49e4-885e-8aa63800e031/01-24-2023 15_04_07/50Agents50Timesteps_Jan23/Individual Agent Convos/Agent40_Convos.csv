41,40,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
49,40,wearing this mask and it being so hot
40,2,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon!
40,6,I love how you put it on.
40,11,This is what my mother said to me when she had to be vaccinated and she told me she wasn't vaccinated. And it happened to her all the time.
40,12,"I ve been vaccinated for about 8 years and I've never done anything, so I'm pretty sure I've never been in the wild, but I have the same reaction to vaccinating my daughter's mom."
40,15,"It's like you're gonna die if you're not vaccinated to go in there, so you need a mask and a mask."
40,17,>seciation of the mask
40,20,The mask mandate should not be lifted so that all women in the world can get the vaccine. That's why the public has to choose the people they want vaccinated.
40,24,This is a good thing because of the people that have to fight for their health and to not be in the middle of something like a cold.
40,26,I love the op.
40,28,It really is the first time I have a kid that's been vaccinated.
40,30,Vaccines have gotten a lot hotter these days with a mask mandate
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER >> ""She has been vaccinated"""
40,37,"So, hey I got to be in her home when I was little, and I didn't get to go see her or my mom because I felt so bad about it!"
40,39,"I believe it is that the doctor hasn't been able to get vaccinated yet, but has said that he's not even gonna do that yet."
41,40,"The thing is, it's a nationalized topic so much so that many players don't know how to get up on the field unless the mandate is lifted. It's also a nationalized topic because we have a lot of athletes with masks, and many of them even have a helmet. It's like a tad crazy to see the same old person get a different one because of the mask mandate."
49,40,"[Dave, how hot is this mask](https://www.tumblr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Python-Python-Moto-Return-to-Women-Joint/Tap_Python_Mixer-Women_It_Bowling_Mixer_Foot)."
40,2,I was just reading the comment section when this was posted.
40,6,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon! I love how you put it on. This is what my mother said to me when she had to be vaccinated and she told me she wasn't vaccinated. And it happened to her all the time.
40,11,It's just a mask.

40,15,"I just like to think that I've heard of the new ""Age of Immunization"" campaign."
40,17,"I think it's pretty cool that this is not going to be the topper on this covid cake. I don't know what to do with all of this to get up on the field, but it is interesting that some of the people who are already vaccinated are not going to be able to get the vaccine, they can vaccinate and not get the vaccines they want."
40,20,"So this isn't the point of the article? It was just saying that they didn't get the mandate lifted because women would be more likely to die if they weren't vaccinated, and not vaccinated because women will still get the mandate."
40,24,">The thing is, it's a nationalized topic so much so that many players don't know how to get up on the field unless the mask mandate is lifted."

40,30,That's what happened to me. I was a child and had to vaccinate the entire time I was a kid. They say you are supposed to wear a mask. I'm guessing that we all have our own medical issues.
40,35,"Well, you're a little young."
40,37,"And they're saying: they shouldn't make it mandatory that every woman in the world can get the vaccine, because women aren't responsible for their own health. I mean, why should women wear masks if they aren't able to get the vaccine?"
40,39,There's only one problem with this. I got it for my daughter. I had the same reaction. The mask mandate can be lifted but I don't think it's fair that everyone gets vaccinated for some reason. I feel like my daughter is getting vaccinated a lot but I don't get the same reaction as her vaccinated mom.
41,40,"I'd say that it's not really a mask and you have to pay a lot of money to get a mask. But if the mandate isn't lifted, it's going to get worse."

40,28,So a man who is a woman who is not a woman and who does not know what a woman is is a woman who says he has no idea how a woman is? I think that's the worst thing a woman could do and then someone can decide how to respond and what the person will think. That is ridiculous.
