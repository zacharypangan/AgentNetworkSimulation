30,1,"I remember when I was a young kid when I was a kid. We had a vaccinated woman as a baby, and she was wearing a mask."
30,10,I'm really glad i've got covid in my family. This is amazing.
30,12,it was my first experience wearing a mask and I didn't like the tv. i'm a tv. i was a game coach and was vaccinated for it. i remember when it was in the back of the car and they put on my a mask.
30,13,That's like the only time i ever wore a mask before i got a coach :/
30,15,"A lot of people are vaccinated, but this is a good one."
30,20,"If you wear a mask to protect yourself, you can't go into the bathroom, you can't go into the bathroom. It's like you have to get a mask on or it'll get you hurt."
30,23,"I think the first time you get sick from a mask is with a gun, you don't wear one. I always do when i'm sick, because of the mask, I like to wear them for a few days. And then my face gets hot and uncomfortable as well. I would hate to be vaccinated, but for someone who is sick and would be too old to wear a mask in the first place. I eat a lot of food and drink all the time, and I wear a mask every day."
37,30,"The realism of ""wearing the mask to protect yourself"" has been lost since its release in 82."
40,30,Vaccines have gotten a lot hotter these days with a mask mandate

30,1,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you that you will be vaccinated and that you've gotten your face checked for covi, but that your face is hot."
30,10,What is the most difficult part of the process of getting vaccinated?
30,12,I think the only way to tell that it s so hot is to get a hot shower.
30,13,"Vaccines are not universal, they are not universal. It's a pretty common misconception in medicine to have a skin cancer and not to have a head shot."
30,15,They are the best vaccines ever. I don't understand the hype around it. It's a huge pain and it's a shame for your skin. I don't think they should put a mask on your face for all time. It's like going into the bathroom and the skin starts burning out.
30,20,"In my experience a man can not wear a mask, especially if he was unable to breathe in the car. When he wasn't working out, he would often get shattered on a motorcycle. And he couldn't just walk in and play if he wanted, he'd get shattered."
30,23,So many people are vaccinated  and how do you get vaccinated?
37,30,"No, it's not lost."
40,30,That's what happened to me. I was a child and had to vaccinate the entire time I was a kid. They say you are supposed to wear a mask. I'm guessing that we all have our own medical issues.
42,30,"I think the people in this thread are too concerned with health care issues and not interested in identifying the specific causes of the disease. For instance, I'm not sure whether or not the person asking you doesn't have a serious medical condition or a virus."

49,30,"It's still quite hot though. The next one, and it's so hot, so hot it makes me want to pull my hair out."
30,1,"That is a very serious issue for everyone, and a lot of doctors and researchers are going to be extremely unwell by the end of this week."
30,10,I'm going to give you the answers first.
30,12,"I don't believe it, and I'm gonna say it again, I have never been vaccinated, and I'm not sure if it's anything close to what people say."
30,13,"I think the joke is about ""I'm not interested in identifying the specific causes of the disease. I think the people in this thread are too concerned with health care issues and not interested in identifying the specific causes of the disease."
30,15,"It seems a fucking lot to be the case. When I first got it, I didn't know there was a way to get it under my helmet. That isn't really how I figured it out. I thought it was just as annoying and so I've since had to be pretty sure I have an allergy. I didn't know there was anything else I could do besides to go for a run. I'm just glad I was vaccinated."
30,20,I'd go to a hospital and get checked for covi. But I'd get vaccinated for cancer. Not to mention get blood tests for it.
30,23,I don't believe the CDC was just mentioning it.
