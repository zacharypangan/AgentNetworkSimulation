26,21,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
31,26,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
40,26,woman come on guys says you gotta wear a mask to go in there woman if you re not vaccinated woman exactly woman s daughter my momma says she s naturally vaccinated
42,26,why do people keep asking this yes i ve had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it
26,7,Were you exposed to a school?
26,10,The only other reason a voter did not vote was because they didn't know what the issue was until they got on the ballot. They were concerned about the safety of the school and the public health dept.
26,21,It ain't the only way to make people feel good...
31,26,"How is wearing a mask preventing someone from breathing the cold, and that it is effective in preventing the disease? I just don't see it helping with other problems. I've always thought about how we can stop a lot of this."
40,26,I love the op.
42,26,"How about you just wear one on yourself? It might be a simple trick, but that isn't really working."
26,7,"There are many things that they have to do, like tripping or making a screamer to try and stay out of the air. Getting a screamer might be a good idea but it's not like it's going to change your life."
26,10,The reason I'm wondering is because people have a hard time believing that the mask is going to prevent some serious illness like pneumonia.
26,21,"In California there are other schools which do this. It's a way of making sure you aren't getting drained and not having it everywhere you go, while protecting yourself from a disease that is likely not in your control, like a car, or even a dog. A lot of people are going to a place that doesn't allow this, but that doesn't mean they don't care about the safety of other people's health. The best way to stop it is to stop it."
31,26,"I love how it's an amazing thing you can wear one every time you're in the office or work out with people. I'm not a doctor but I don't know much about vaccines. I think the problem is when people don't have a mask in them, if they don't get enough, they don't need to get the right one. I feel like that's pretty bullshit."
40,26,"You can't say ""I love the op"" in that sentence, but it makes me chuckle..."
42,26,What? Why do people keep asking this? What is a virus? That's so true.
26,7,"I'm confused about the question of why people don't have a mask in them. I mean, you don't have to wear a mask every time you work out with people, you have to wear a mask at work? It's probably to keep people from breathing the cold, and it's not actually something that is necessary for people to be vaccinated against."
26,10,What’s the problem with this?
26,21,[Mom]: Why are people continuing to ask me about this because of all the comments on here. It's a really bad idea.
31,26,...because I am not sure I can get enough.

40,26,Vaccines have been tested for a few weeks now. I hope you get an extra dose soon! I love how you put it on.
42,26,"My mom asked me to try my own. I did not. She said I could get sick and got sick. If I had to get sick and died, I would have had a doctor come out. I would ask if there was any sort of infection that I could prevent, but that it would be something to do with me putting on a mask, which I thought would do the trick. I was pretty scared and didn't want to get sick. She had a Xray in the fridge in the winter so I wouldn't think a virus was a thing. That's "
26,7,"I've been at an OB/GYN office, and they don't like the idea. They're afraid that I could get sick from a small illness that would cause a large bleed, and they're not interested in getting a mask. It's about not having enough blood in a system that makes it impossible for them to get one."
26,10,"Vaccines are not good for your kids. If they want their own health then it's better if you have a mask with them in it. I don't think the government will make any more money with this, since you'll need a mask in the school."
26,21,"[NAME] [NAME] has the same message about the mask being ""unfavorable"" to all children."
