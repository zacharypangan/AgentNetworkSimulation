8,4,"Exactly. That was a good one for me. You might also want to consider taking the vaccine at school with you to see if you can put a mask on your face, which could be useful, for example to show your immunity."
8,5,"My friend was diagnosed with a virus called ""vaccin and he had to use a mask."" The CDC has the same problem with the vaxx virus and is the best."
10,8,You should read the wikipedia article here. It's about the way the mask system works and that's why people wear it to prevent the spread of HIV or it's harmful.
17,8,If you don't wear a mask a lot you can't be an vaccinate holder. Its like having you rip your dick off when you go to a store to buy food to cover your mouth.

17,8,It is an example of how this will lead to a situation like this where you can no longer be vaccinated because of it.

I've never understood why he's trying to explain how it actually works. I think he's trying to explain how much of a bit of a lie he has. I think if they signed the mandate, the people with the ACA would not have been in the health care system. I'm sorry to have a fucking fuck"
28,8,"I hate to admit but I would probably not want to see your kid vaccinated at a job interview. You have two options for the job interview, they'd have to go with a mask if you aren't familiar with their stance and i would be very upset if they didn't."

17,8,You sound like a very cool guy.
28,8,"Probably just a retaliation for being vaccinated. He didn't sign the ACA, he voted to repeal it in 2010, and has been doing it since then. He blew that shit out of proportion. That's why he acted in a fucked up way. He's not going to change the law. That's why he has to say it."
