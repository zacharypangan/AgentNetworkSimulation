34,31,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
36,31,wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym
37,31,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
42,31,why do people keep asking this yes i ve had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it
43,31,breaking indianapolis city county council has voted to ratify new public health orders which include removing the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals the health orders now go to the mayor to be signed
46,31,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,It's an awesome thing you can wear one every time you're in the office or work out with people.
31,13,"I'm not a doctor but I don't know much about vaccines. I think the problem is when people don't have a mask in them, if they don't get enough, they don't need to get the right one. I feel like that's pretty bullshit."
31,17,"OP, here's a great one: it helps that a mask is worn before the game starts and then it's on and off."
31,18,I'm a guy who's going to resign from coaching because my players won't be wearing the mask...
31,26,"How is wearing a mask preventing someone from breathing the cold, and that it is effective in preventing the disease? I just don't see it helping with other problems. I've always thought about how we can stop a lot of this."
31,28,You could wear a mask at a job interview? Why is it so invasive?
34,31,I was just trying to say this. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
36,31,It's a lot easier than that to wear a mask.
37,31,"Oh god, yes. Do you wear a mask because you want to protect yourself, that's a great way to protect yourself."
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,I have the same problem i am having with my kids: their's not a good enough excuse to go to the dentist's to get them to put their hands on the helmet when they come to a medical office for emergency services. The doctor drew my attention because a man who had an appointment to go to a medical clinic could never go to his doctor for the first time because he could not find the'stuff' about the mask if he got a new one on the way to get one for the rest of his life.
42,31,How often do you eat in the city when you aren't at work? It makes me feel so miserable. When I was a kid I always tried to wear a mask.
43,31,This is a good decision! This will go to the mayor and will be signed!
46,31,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,You are talking about a part of the system that a vaccinated person wears to prevent the virus from spreading through the lungs and thereby preventing infection.
31,13,"The mask mandate is still in effect for most of us, so there are no good reasons for a restraining order to be lifted."
31,17,It does help. It helps to keep a person from letting it slide.
31,18,It's not a joke.
31,26,"I love how it's an amazing thing you can wear one every time you're in the office or work out with people. I'm not a doctor but I don't know much about vaccines. I think the problem is when people don't have a mask in them, if they don't get enough, they don't need to get the right one. I feel like that's pretty bullshit."
31,28,So basically they wear the mask for the job interview - as long as they don't go on a bad day with other people - or for the jobs?
34,31,"You have to show that the government doesn't need to use a jab or mask to protect the civilians, so they don't need the jab."
36,31,I don't really understand why people are so pissed. It sounds like the media is trying to make it seem like these people were just a little bit less fucked up. Almost as if they were being obnoxious and not resigning themselves.
37,31,"Despite the fact that the aphids are harmless, it's not impossible to protect yourself."
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,"So, if I had the opportunity to wear a mask and my kids wouldn't come to their doctor, they'd be using a mask. Unless we start covering the entire head and shoulders with a mask or a helmet, why aren't we starting to see it as a thing? That means we need to have a real debate about the mask mandate, not about it and it's an issue. You can't put a mask on an injured person on their face, and you can't put the mask on your shin. It sounds like you'"
42,31,"When I found it it would say ""I never get it"" (which I assumed is correct) because people who have had multiple exposures did not know the facts and the answer wasn't true."
43,31,"The city council should have voted to get rid of the mask mandate. Yes, I'd like to see this ratified."
46,31,I ain't even talking about a helmet. I ain't gonna stop myself.
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,"I think the point of a mask mandate is that, when people wear it, you put a mask in them and you use it to protect them. They wear a mask for job interviews, so if they didn't know the facts and a restraining order to be lifted, you'd have to show that the government doesn't need to use a mask to protect the civilians."
31,13,The fact that this guy is a'really' great teacher doesn't make it any less real or interesting.
31,17,Until the aforementioned aphids are detected they don't have any idea what it's like to have a child in a school building with a mask. If there are other people whose eyes are open but never in the classroom then they probably don't know what they're doing.
31,18,You have a really good understanding of the issues involved in the prevention of aphids.
31,26,...because I am not sure I can get enough.
31,28,"Exactly, and not like they need to make a restraining order to lift it. If they actually want it, then they're gonna get it."
34,31,I feel like this is an example of how people will have to act differently than how people have to act. People shouldn't have to put up with things like that unless they absolutely have to.
36,31,"I do not really get what you are saying. I scream, ""My coach told me to spit on my feet."" My husband tells me that I must spit on my feet. I spit on my feet all the time. I do not understand why people say that I am not comfortable with my teammates wearing the same shit. I do not understand why anyone is so pissed and not resigning."
37,31,"Yes, it's a nonsense and a terrible idea, I don't know why people are so pissed about that."
39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
41,31,"Unless that's the way it worked out, that's the way it worked out."
42,31,"In a healthy society, many doctors are trained to detect and treat an infection. In a healthy society, not everyone is able to catch it."
43,31,The mayor of the county in Ohio is a party member of the government. You do not have to vote to sign any public health orders. The councillor has to ratify these 'public health orders'. Keeping the mandate alive is not the same as getting off the health order until it is done.
46,31,"[NAME] is a non-competitive guy. He doesn't believe in sports, and does a lot of things for other people."
51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,"I can't be the only one that's snide. I'm a teacher and I have a friend who wears a mask every day in class, and he's not doing anything. I'm afraid I'm not the only one that's snide. I've snide. And I don't really have a good grasp of the science behind it."
31,13,"I am a sailor, I don't know about you, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm an athlete. I think it's nice to have that sort of information. I have to make sure to get as much information as possible before I give my kids a chance to get the right one. I've done a lot of work for a teacher in college. My parents were very protective and helpful towards me at school. I was able to put my kids in the right place, and the sailor made it that way, but I don"
31,17,The problem is the school's mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
31,18,"People are being pissed and not resigning because the aphids are showing up. If your teammates don't get the aphids, then your coach is screwed, if you're willing to quit, you won't resign. I think the message of the mask mandate is that people are being pissed and not resigning."
31,26,As a teacher I don't really have a problem with the mask mandate.
31,28,"I don't know why you are getting down voted. I'm very disappointed if you don't know that people have a right to tell people what their government wants, but it's just not true."
34,31,[i was just trying to say this. This is why they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. Is the bomber really going to get it?
36,31,"OP, I have no idea why I haven't heard of ""spinning masks on my feet"" or ""I don't know why people are not comfortable with my teammates wearing the same shit."""
37,31,And you're telling me that a person isn't a woman because they have apnea scars. They're telling you that a mask doesn't work because it's a nonsense and a terrible idea.

42,31,"I’m so sorry to hear that. That makes me feel terrible, if people think I’m the only one with an infectious disease, but I can see where that is coming from."
43,31,The fact that a man who wants to change the ACA is a red flag.

51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

31,17,"I’ve seen a documentary, and I’ve had a few people ask me if I can have any experience with this topic and I’m sure it will be entertaining."
31,18,"I don't really see what the ""masked mandate"" is about. Is there a 'fake' mask mandate?"
31,26,The guy who blew me away is probably a doctor or one of the people who is a doctor whose job is to prevent people from dying from AIDS.

51,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,12,I think the problem is that the mask mandate is a big deal to them and they shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask.
31,13,That is so cruel. I was told that masks are pretty common in schools. I don't know what a mask actually is.
31,17,This is a very good idea to be honest.
31,18,"No, they are trying to prevent people from dying of HIV and other deadly diseases from becoming the cause of the ACA. They aren't going to stop anyone from being infected."

31,28,I've seen this documentary and am amazed at the amount of answers that people give to the mask mandate. You'll know what I mean.
34,31,Is it a sappy movie? I think so. The second one.. but it's really really bad.
36,31,This guy has to show you what the virus is! He's not the guy who wrote this.

39,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

31,28,i do not see why people will not be able to take part in a job interview with a mask because they can't see a lot of people getting a vaccine?

31,13,"I love hats. I've never had a problem getting the right one. And it's pretty hard to get rid of it. I haven't had one for about 5 years, and I feel like it's pretty much a joke. I've had it for awhile, and it seems to not have changed a whole lot because of it."
31,17,I would rather have a hat. Probably a joke. But I can't see it being a joke.
31,18,I think it's a great idea. I love the idea of hats. I love the idea of them but I also like having a scarf on.
31,26,You're too short. You aren't smart enough to understand that the AIDS epidemic is an issue. You don't know what AIDS means and what AIDS means. Clearly your hunch isn't the first time that has been mentioned.
31,28,"I have a lot of love of hats. I love the idea, but I am not sure how it comes to me. I do. I would feel bad."
34,31,I hate wearing hats.
36,31,It's also a fetish. But there's more to it than that.

41,31,You need a doctor's appointment to discuss the Mask mandate.

43,31,I just want to make sure you understand that the ACA is not a big deal.

31,12,"It has been written a long time but I don't really understand how it could be so difficult to explain. The mask mandate is a joke in itself, it just can't be an effective tool for keeping people from getting infected. If you're talking about how it's a joke then you can't get to know about what it is."
31,13,What can we do to prevent a hat from being a joke? Are you aware of any signs of AIDS or how it might get infected?
31,17,Because the ACA and the ACA are not about preventing people from getting vaccinated. The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke.
31,18,>I love the idea of hats. I love the idea of hats. I love the idea of hats. They're just hats.
31,26,I think I'm going to take a big leap here.
31,28,"I'm a coach, but I get it. And the fact that you're trying to put this in perspective is absurd. It was passed in 2010, but when you start putting it in perspective I am going to have to say that I grew up thinking the mask mandate was an easy and legal way to do it, and when you start to see people coming in for interviews, you realize the problem is that it isn't. I think it's weird because the government isn't trying to change that."
34,31,I hate wearing a hat.
36,31,"In addition to putting a mask on every time the CDC sucks, there's no way a healthy person would not wear one. A person is a human being and a person is a human being, and the CDC is a sham. There is no right or wrong way to take on the virus. The truth is that the CDC has a problem with this. I'm not saying it's an issue of the person's fetish, but the actual issue is that the CDC has to give up an opportunity to do this and"
