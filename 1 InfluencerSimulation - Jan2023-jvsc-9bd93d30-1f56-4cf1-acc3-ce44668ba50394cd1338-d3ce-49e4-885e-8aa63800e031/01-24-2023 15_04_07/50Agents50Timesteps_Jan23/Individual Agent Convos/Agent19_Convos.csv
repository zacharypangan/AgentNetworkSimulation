34,19,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
47,19,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
49,19,wearing this mask and it being so hot
19,2,"I have the Covid as my life saver. Probably not the cheapest, but I was only 17 in my 30s so I could have gotten one."
19,9,"Why does someone need a mask? If you like chemo and you don't like wearing one, that is a bad thing."
32,19,"I get it. My masks help hide the virus. My skin is pretty sensitive, it's able to hide all the signs that this virus is getting in my hair."
34,19,"Ha ha, awwww..."
47,19,Oh man. If you want to say something oh man.
49,19,Wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask and it being so hot wearing this mask
19,2,The Covid is a medically proven vaccine and has been used to treat AIDS from many different sources. It is not just a medical device.
19,9,Because your skin is sensitive and your face is sensitive. This makes my skin itch on the outside and causes me to itch even more.
32,19,"if i had a face like that i would always wear a mask a lot. it would be a bad thing if i had a face like that because my skin is very sensitive. i would irmafuture if i would fuck that face. and if i had a face like that i would definitely start with a mask. I just want to get out there and have fun, but the remorse of doing it in a good way is a big part of my day"
34,19,Is the bomber really going to get it?
47,19,"I think I got this: in Georgia, where a lot of people wear a mask, the man with the mask has a very weird head shape. Having the face, neck and back trimmed is very, very awkward. If people are going to speak in Georgia, it's not like someone has to tell you anything that can't be done."
49,19,"I have a funny friend who does a weird thing about my hair in the summer, like it's hot and it's hot and it's hot. It's like the sun's been blowing up her hair in summer."
19,2,"IANAL but I read in a doctor's office that it's the first thing that comes to mind when I am with friends, which is the medical technology."
19,9,i would irmafuture if i would fuck that face. and if i had a face like that i would definitely start with a mask.
32,19,'get the body i want or break out on my face from having to wear a mask at the gym'
34,19,"Y'know, because the movie is pretty bad. The only thing that made me not know it was that the name 'Ajax' was actually actually a sappy movie. I'd like to see a movie where it's more like the 'Ajax' movie."
47,19,"In some areas I would like to see something I've seen, but haven't seen."
49,19,"Then this was my first thought as well, I thought it was about a cool and kinda cool guy."
19,2,"IANAL but I read in a doctor's office that it's the first thing that comes to mind when I am with friends, which is the medical technology. i would irmafuture if i would fuck that face. and if i had a face like that i would definitely start with a mask."
19,9,"i have a friend who wears the opium masks in the park at work, i have never seen a movie like that before."
32,19,"My favorite part of this is it's really the last sentence. I guess it's going to sound strange, but I'll leave it as a remark about having a mask at work that doesn't help my skin and that I don't like to wear a mask for work."
34,19,"I'm sorry but I'm not going to watch the movie. I don't want to live in the Middle East. It's not going to be a great movie, it'll just be a fun one."
47,19,"I've been in Georgia several times where people wear masks, but not in Georgia."
49,19,I love that there isn't anything that makes me uncomfortable in hot clothes.
19,2,"I'm not sure it's too snarky to say that, but it sounds like the mask is a shit and nitpicky thing to wear a lot, it's a pretty shabby name that's a lot more appropriate. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see a movie like that. It's not going to be a great movie, it'll just be a fun one."
19,9,"Why is it a joke? I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, but don’t try to be offensive."

34,19,It would be nice to have a sappy movie with some nice people and some fun. EDIT: awwwww...
47,19,I feel bad for the person. I'm from Georgia and my school district has a group of people that wear a mask.
49,19,"> ""I love being uncomfortable wearing hot clothes because I am hot."""
19,2,"I know what you mean. There is an important distinction between ""I do not like to be uncomfortable with things you don't like about yourself,"" and ""I wear my face with a mask to work or play with people. I don't think I am going to have a good time in a movie because it seems like I do"" and ""But I have been wearing a mask for years because I am too sensitive to go into the gym with my mask""."
19,9,I feel bad for people like this.
32,19,This isn't a remark. This is a remark.
34,19,The first sentence says it's too bad the movie isn't great.
47,19,I had to see a doctor about it.
49,19,Is it the kind of thing that make you like a certain kind of guy?
19,2,"This was the first time I ever saw the word ""a mask"" before being told it 'was wrong' and I'm not trying to be offensive."
19,9,"So, my friend who had the virus in his face has been wearing a mask for years now?"
32,19,"I think the movie ""The Innkeeper"" is one of the best sex videos ever made. You're absolutely right about getting into a mental illness, and you're right about not wanting to get a body if you see it. I am looking forward to reading all the other good movies and getting a new mask and tying up my life with it."
34,19,"My dick is a hat, not a mask, I think."
47,19,"He can't be honest, I was in Georgia, and it was pretty hard to tell from the pictures... I would not have thought to talk about it."
49,19,The only time it's funny is in movies. It's like the movie of you're hot and the whole whole movie just makes you uncomfortable.
19,2,"There's a movie called ""The Innkeeper"". I can only imagine how hot that guy is."
19,9,"A lot of things I read about masks being offensive and in some instances, it's very true to my personal experience."
32,19," Is a lot of the reference to the movies as well. That's really the last sentence. I'll leave it as a remark about having a mask at work that doesn't help my skin and that I don't like to wear a mask at work. I'd rather wear a mask at a gym and not have to wear a mask, but I wouldn't wear a mask at a lot. Unless you're looking for a sarcastic sentence, I see your point."
34,19,"""Always see a hat, sometimes a mask, sometimes a mask, sometimes a mask"""
47,19,"This is my first time going to Georgia. I'm pretty sure my college has a bunch of guys who don't wear masks. My sister is from a major area. But the thing is that when a doctor tries to stop someone from having an erection, they tell us a little bit about it. My friend grew up in the suburbs of Georgia. He is actually from Texas, so he lives in GA, and he's very interested in the health of our country. I'm not sure how much you've heard of them..."
49,19,"OP, there are plenty of movies that just sound like comedy in a sense."
19,2,"There is a lot of weirdness that comes along with having a mask in the workplace, so if you don't get a job, and you're still in a job and a mask for the first month and a half of the year, then I don't feel that you have any idea what you are doing. I think you know the feeling and that you aren't the only one who's having sex in the workplace. You know that there's some good humor about it, and it could be a great way to deal with it."
19,9,"I was at a party in Georgia a few years ago when I was in high school. I was terrified to be in a movie, and I tried to avoid getting caught on video."
32,19,"[Pages: the main point of this post. I think you need to read through it. I am looking for a sarcastic sentence. The movie ""The Innkeeper"" is one of the best sex videos ever made.

32,19,"No, the whole sub is a r/do-good-but-don't-have-a-lot of people arguing about what's actually funny in the movies. So, while it sounds like you're looking forward to the movies, you should read through the rest of your comments a bit more."
34,19,"I don't really get what you are saying. I just think it's pretty funny, but I don't like the whole thing."
47,19,"> I'm just trying to understand - you can't just get an erection, and if you're going to the hospital for Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,19,"I'm not going to go to a book about hats and all that, but I do read a book that has hot skin. I'm an introvert so I'll never get into it. I feel like I have a tendency to feel the same way a lot of people do."
19,2,"I mean, you could say a lot about ""the best sex video ever made"" and ""the worst sex movie ever made."
19,9,"It's not my fault, but I am not gonna lie. I don't believe in anyone, I am pretty sure you didn't see the movie."
32,19,"In the first part of your question you stated that the movie is ""The Innkeeper"" and not ""The Innkeeper"" but the movie was a great movie and the joke about sex is a good one."
34,19,"I don't think I'm utterly witty, but I do think the movie is pretty funny."
47,19,"There is an article on the news recently, and it was written by a woman who is sick and got an ER appointment. This is a question that is addressed in the CDC. That is the sex clinic where the ER was created. The hospital is in Atlanta and their ER is in Atlanta. This was written by a doctor who was a resident of the same city as the guy who isn't wearing masks. It's about the doctors that will use masks to protect a person, not their family or friends or anyone else, because that's all "
49,19,"I have a friend like that. We do a lot of jokes in this sub, but if you like that sub and can't get into it, don't do it. It's a way for you to make yourself more comfortable. It's not a thing to be comfortable in. It's not like the world is a place, but it's a place."

32,19,"I've had sex with people in similar circumstances, with sex like yours (even though i've had a friend who had sex with a man in a similar situation) and a person like that was very concerned about the effects of the disease on his body. That was part of my struggle to learn sex. I didn't get through the entire sex scene - I just knew that my body was the most infected thing in the world and I felt very bad. Then I stumbled across a movie that I hated."
34,19,The hat joke is pretty good. The movie is the only movie I enjoy.

47,19,Is that how they find the reason that the CDC doesn't use masks to protect the public from the virus?

32,19,i'd wear a mask at work
34,19,"""The hat joke is pretty good. The movie is the only movie I enjoy."

32,19,There's also the sarcastic comments that say I can't get into the sex scene. I think I would say that the problem is the sarcasm. I could probably have said I wouldn't have worn a mask at a lot of places I don't want to wear a mask.

32,19,I don't have to wear a mask to get into sex. It's just not a good joke. The problem is that you could have said that you don't like it at work. That was part of the sex scene.
