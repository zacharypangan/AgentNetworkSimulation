27,9,I think the hat trick is a joke that people are using to make fun of the government and their policies. Is there a difference between an act of public protest or one of them being a joke?
36,9,The reason that it's a joke is because you get it because you don't know the difference between a joke and a joke is because it identifies with the fact that people will talk about it when they have no clue what it's about.
