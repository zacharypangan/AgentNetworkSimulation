31,16,CANNOTANSWER. This is a very unhelpful and stupid question. It's a joke that it's meant to protect anyone. They're not meant to protect anyone.

26,16,I think I just found out that a joke came out about someone wearing a mask and he didn't think it was good for a jobless man. They have no reason to think it's a joke if people haven't been on the road and have no idea how to drive around there. They're telling the truth that they can't go outside without the mask on.

31,16,It's not a joke. The idea is to put people in a mask. This isn't about infecting others. This is about how to spread the virus from the government to whoever is in need.

19,16,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm sorry you're experiencing this as well. I just think it's a shame, and I don't understand what is going on. I just think it's a joke. They are going to change its policies so that it is a joke."
24,16,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
26,16,In that scenario a person can't afford to go to a doctor or get their job. There are no other benefits for the person without a mask.

31,16,"That's a really good idea. I can see that you think the idea of going to a party with the mask mandate is a joke, but I feel like this sucks, especially if you're not a conservative. You're not a fan of the CDC and you're more of a Republican."
36,16,The issue is that people feel that if they get in trouble then they're doing a better job of hiding the virus from the public.

16,3,Is there a medical problem where you can't get vaccinated? Because it's illegal for you to get sick because of a health care issue.
16,4,Vaccines are not intended to stop people from getting sick. They aren't meant to stop people from getting sick. They aren't meant to prevent people from getting sick.
16,8,So your question is how much is a mask required to get vaccinated?

17,9,There's a movie about a man with a cock tattoo named “Torn to Kill” starring Ben Stiller. It's a good movie and you’re right that it was just directed at me.

25,2,"I think the issue is that the CDC can't take away the masks, and they can't enforce the ACA to stop the spread of HIV."
25,12,It is a joke because a lot of people are saying that these jokes are gonna make people feel like they're not a dick and that people are really not that stupid. But I'm glad to see CDC has worked in the past to reduce this situation.

27,9,Why do you want to be unemployed again? Why can't you just have someone that knows how to use their masks and not be embarrassed about wearing them?
27,10,My husband is currently doing it. I'm wearing a mask.
27,20,I will never change my face mask until I see the other side of the world. I'm not a man of my word
27,24,This seems like the type of thing to do for those who are afraid to do it.
38,27,You mean you like the idea of a mask?
40,27,"The fact that I don't wear a mask on day one doesn't mean I don't want to wear one. I mean, you're only trying to get me in this situation as quickly as possible. You're not going to wear a mask on day two, right?"
41,27,The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot.
43,27,I would wear masks as long as I'm not prone to sickness and/or death. It's probably better than nothing.
27,8,"I'm not saying to wear a mask, but it's a common mistake. If I had the guts to go through an ACA amendment, I'd do it."
27,9,"There's actually one in your book: ""I will never change my face mask until I see the other side of the world"""
27,10,I've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a face mask.
27,20,"I've been wearing a mask for the past two years. I'm wearing a mask because I've been sick for the past 4 years, but I can't wear one anymore. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it. But I'm really afraid of that. You should be ashamed of it, and you'll see."
27,24,The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. I would wear masks as long as I'm not prone to sickness and/or death. It's probably better than nothing.
38,27,"Yeah, if you can't wear a mask that's one of those things that makes you look like a dead body. I've seen it happen with my masks, but I know what you mean."
40,27,He wants a fuck. He wants to give you fucks. He wants a fuck.
41,27,That's exactly what this one does. I don't think it's a good idea to make this one up and put up a petition.
43,27,"Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat."
27,8,"YES. This is a good one. I've been in your shoes for almost 2 years and you need to stop being a moron on a job, or you'd better not want to wear one."
27,9,You don't think you can afford to put on a mask? That's just an insult to you.
27,10,I've been looking for a reason to avoid wearing a mask to get help from a doctor.
27,20,It sounds like a pretty funny situation. What exactly is this for?

38,27,I think your mother is being rude.

27,8,"You sound like a liar. I can't explain to you why I'm going to make this video. This guy is making me slut, and you are expressing that he's a liar and you're trying to hide that fact. It's like he has a special talent for making movies like ""Sucks in a box"" or something similar."

27,24,The first thing you need to know about this situation is that it seems like you've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a mask. It sounds like your mother has been going around asking for this as a way to reassure you that you're the one bringing you up and that you should stop being an asshole to her.
38,27,"''Um, I'm sorry'', it's not a joke, I'm talking about the mask."
40,27,He's like the dick of old people:
41,27,"The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. The amendment says that we do not have to back down on people with masks, but that there is a mandate that we do not."
43,27,I want a video of me with my wife - and I want it to be more about her.
27,8,This is a misunderstanding. It's one of those things that people seem to think is ridiculous and unwarranted by the Constitution. And it's something that many are surprised about. That's why the amendment is so controversial that it doesn't matter what the ACA says or how people wear them. They don't make the right decision and I would like to see the video as a ploy to keep everyone informed of how much is being spent and how much is being spent and not being able to vote a good one.
27,9,> The first thing you need to know about this situation is that it seems like you've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a mask.

27,24,I think it's a tad creepy to point out that the masks in my video are used because they prevent people from getting sick. It is also a tad disgusting and potentially dangerous to you. It's pretty fucking ridiculous.

I had a very nice sex drive in a town where there are some of the most racist places on the planet."
43,27,"It was the best video I've seen, and I hope it's more about her, not your husband's."
27,8,The ACA doesn't revoke the right to wear a mask.

27,10,He can't afford to have a child with a medical condition in the US?
27,20,My husband wore a mask for three years.
27,24,"I think you're overreacting, especially since you've been to some of the most racist places on the planet."
38,27,"I'm not even sure what that would be about. My husband would do that. I was a bit dick about it. I didn't want to get in contact with him. He made it clear that he's not going to do this, and it's time to tell him that the masks aren't for sex or anything else."
40,27,"I think that the first sentence is ""He's like the dick of old people: I'm a young man. I was one of those people.

27,24,"The reason for this is that the ACA doesn't do that, but that it isn't a constitutional amendment."
38,27,So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected?
40,27,"I don't think you know what a dick is, I think it's very simple. He's got a job, he's a douche, but it's not about keeping you safe - he's about letting his wife have sex, he's about keeping his life happy."
41,27,I think it's important to look for ways to address the situation.
43,27,">I'm not sure if it's because of my health, but it is definitely necessary to get a mask. A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick, it is useless and I hate it."
27,8,"As someone who lives in Florida, I can say that there's a lot more to that than the ACA."
27,9,I don't think it's a blunder at all to try and talk about this. It sounds like he was making a crappy move.

27,20,i'm not the dick who says this.
27,24,Why is it illegal for an adult to wear a mask because it stops a person from getting sick? Is this the one thing that made you think he needed to buy a mask?
38,27,"A mask can't prevent the infection if it is worn properly or not. The CDC, in their mandate, has to remove the mask in place of the infection."
40,27,"It's not about keeping you safe, it's about letting his wife have sex."
41,27,I wouldn't think that he would try and get a man to come to that conclusion if his own town decided not to put a sleeve on the streets in public.
43,27,I am not a doctor. I am a medical professional. I can make videos of myself with my wife.
27,8,"I'm not a lawyer. But I've been in the shoes of patients and they wear masks. The one thing they are trying to explain is they're being ""pro-choice"" when they say ACA isn't a valid solution to the issue. If they are unable to do so, that's a very bad idea and I doubt the situation would change if I had to do that."
27,9,"In my opinion, if he was making a crappy move, then the CDC is not a constitutional amendment. In the US, the government is not authorized to remove masks, but does allow an adult to wear them in public."
27,10,"i'm not sure if i know the answer, but the answer is yes, making a mask can prevent an infection but that shit does not stop anyone from getting sick"
27,20,">A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick. Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it."

So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected."
40,27,"It's called a ""Dick"" slash, which is a very common word used in the American sense for dick-shaming. A doctor will make it clear that you aren't going to help, and it is important that you stay in your head about it."
41,27,I think that it's a good thing that this is a national issue.
43,27,">I thought you would say ""I'm not sure if it's because of my health, but it is definitely necessary to get a mask. A person who has a virus that has been infected doesn't have to wear a mask, so as to have to wear a mask when it resides in the area."

40,27,"He's just a dick, not a cure. It's not about keeping you safe, it's about letting your wife have sex."
41,27,I would also take a deep breath for a minute before putting the ACA in the ballot. I'd have a pretty decent idea why you think it's racist.

It was a lot easier for the US to convince people to vote for an amendment to allow people to wear a mask and have people a better life than a woman, or a man or woman that had a more powerful chance of getting an ACA Amendment.

27,24,ACA is not a constitutional amendment. It isn't a constitutional amendment. It isn't a constitutional amendment.
38,27,"So you're saying ""it's a joke."" Isn't that the first time this happened?"
40,27,"[RAIN], the first line of text from the article."
41,27,"It's a big issue. As a Republican, I believe that it should be addressed."
43,27,You are not a doctor.
27,8,"It's not a new political issue. It's a big issue. As a Republican, I believe that it should be addressed. You are not a doctor."
27,9,"The ACA isn't racist, it's about how the law is being applied to the American people and their cultural heritage. ""I'm really not a doctor, but I really just wanna say that it's a joke and a joke. It is about how the law is being applied to the American people and their cultural heritage."
27,10,"I have a very low HIV status and a dick mask. I don't think this is a good idea. I don't think it's racist to say something like ""cannot see how this is possible."
27,20,"I've been in your shoes for almost two years, but I can't wear one anymore. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it. But I'm really afraid of that."
27,24,"I see a lot of these comments are about the lack of answers in the first line, a lot of them are in response to a broader issue."
38,27,I think there's a lot of different interpretations of the CDC's policies as a joke than people think. The fact that he's saying 'oh I'm sorry' is ridiculous.
40,27,Is there any way I'm getting rid of this one?
41,27,I don't think it should be addressed. It's a political issue.
43,27,"The joke is, but the joke is not a joke."
27,8,I think the best way to describe it would be:
27,9,"As the other comments point out, a majority of the comments imply that this was a joke and a conspiracy theory."
27,10,"As a Republican, I believe that it should be addressed."
27,20,A dick mask is not required by law or constitutional law. It's a form of protection and a form of protection for a virus. The people who are infected don't have the rights to wear it. They do not have the right to have their own medical facility.
27,24,"In my opinion, this isn't a big deal. You are a creep. The fact that he is just saying ""I don't think it's racist to say something like that, I think it's a joke and a joke"" is all obnoxious."
38,27,"It seems like he's using a joke to convince his wife that he's not going to do it, because he wants her to be cured of the disease. Obviously, it's a joke, but the fact that he's wearing a mask is a joke. He's going to have to be a dickhead about it."

27,10,"I don't think it's racist. If a person's health is compromised, a CDC audit would not be conducted by the government, so I think the ACA should be ruled on by the government to determine whether that's the case, and not by a judge."
27,20,"Is this a dick-cap, or a mask?"
27,24,"I don't understand how this has to do with his wife, if she's a Democrat, but the people who are Texan don't support him."
38,27,I'm not really sure why people like this joke and you referred to it as a joke.

27,8,"Aren't some of the other statements in the comment thread about the ACA's ""funny"" idea?"
27,9,"No it doesn't, but the government is allowed to make a ban on the use of a dick hat."
27,10,CANNOTANSWER:
27,20,"A man wearing a mask for 2 years has a symptom, a condition, a diagnosis, a cure and a health insurance plan. But if you want to know more about this you should call a health insurance company to speak with them."

27,9,"CANNOTANSWER is not a doctor, but is an activist at the same time. The ACA has the same issues."
27,10,The CDC has just made a rule that makes all people who have AIDS not be allowed to wear dicks. They don't want people who aren't able to afford it. This isn't about making people uncomfortable but about preventing it.

27,10,"> (cannot comment on why, a lot of things are missing."
27,20,It's a very valid point.

40,27,"Vaccines kill a virus, but they aren’t meant for a specific type of disease, like a virus, infect others, or a parasite."
41,27,"The first thing that came to mind is that 'Cannot believe this is a big issue'. ""The ACA isn't racist because you don't know what it is, that's not a big issue.

27,24,a) I think this is a joke about how a party is an issue and how the ACA does not have the answers.
38,27,"Is it possible that he’s going to take a hit of it? Maybe, but I’m not sure, because if you had an ex-wife, you’d tell her to do it - he wouldn’t be able to snort with her - because you didn’t want to let her get sick at the same time."

41,27,A Texan was a member of the ACA and the ACA is a tithing thing. The ACA was written on a sleeve to rape a girl. He was also a member of the ACA party and the ACA is legal.

46,32,I'm going to try to put this into context. It's an obvious lie that he's wrong to wear a mask because he's not sure what to do with the virus. This means that he's wrong. But I can't tell him that he's a doctor or something. So I'm not going to tell you that you've already told a lie that is true. You're right he did that to protect other people and he did so to make his own choices on his own.

41,35,i had the most helpful stranger in my life who was still using his mask during my first attempt to use it
35,7,"When I'm not with my mom in my area, I see a lot of this stuff that isn't being enforced for me. I'm not saying I should wear a face mask, but that if a person has no facial recognition I can't make them wear the same mask."
40,35,I have an accident that I think he should get a car accident and wear a face mask on his face - a little scary. Especially on the weekends when he's out driving at a party.
41,35,"The question was - are we really allowed to do something like this without an approval process? We need to get rid of people who have used their masks to make an impact. We need to get rid of the idea that if there are no restrictions for them, they will have to be put up with them. If they aren't allowed to do it, we can't expect to get any benefit from them. So no if there are restrictions. This is why you need to ask how it is gonna be."
35,7,"I'd rather not have a problem with him wearing a face mask. It's a much more direct way to get rid of people that've used their masks to make an impact. If it doesn't work, it doesn't have to."
40,35,"And then when he says you don't twitch, he says that you do. It's a shame he hasn't done this before, because he isn't in the right."

41,35,"If you are not a black man, you are a racist. A man who is a black man can use a mask and it's not a problem."

41,35,I think the fact that it's a major issue is something that has a lot of resonance. It's about how people's assumptions about the issue are distorted by the fact that it's being made. I think it's a bad idea.

37,2,I was a little bit confused at the beginning of this post because I sat through the entire thing and started to reread it in my head. I was able to put it in my head and think that it was a nice thing to do. My bad.

46,37,"I've seen the entire article - from the first time I put it on, it was a picture of a guy that's been wearing a mask for 4 years and he was wearing one for a year after that. I found it to be a little uncomfortable but I still remember the feeling when he wore a mask to protect other people he only cared about himself and was never able to tell."
49,37,I would have been sucked into it if it hadn't happened in my area i would have been sucked into it in my area.
51,37,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
37,2,"He's obviously using the word anti-mask to describe the type of a mask. It's the opposite of what people like to call the ""Mask protect me"". The difference is that wearing a mask doesn't prevent or prevent the virus (it's like that)."

46,37,"What was it like when it happened? Because I knew the name of my friend and he didn't want to see me wearing a mask, he was the one who started a virus. He did that because he loved her so much, she wanted her life back and he was all grown up. That guy has no clue what is going on or who is going to be on the Internet, he's been wearing masks for 4 years and I still still love him."

It is misleading to say that masks do not prevent the virus, it is misleading."
37,32,"I've already said the same thing to a friend. This isn't a good idea. This is not the kind of situation I want to be in. I'd like to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't have the virus. This is not going to work, but there is a huge stigma surrounding it."
37,36,">You don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that."

38,25,"I'm sure if you were a guy you'd feel like a dick and if you had the ability to avoid anything like that, the guy you married could be treated much better with a mask - no wonder it seems so ungrateful and unnecessarily narcissistic and immature."
38,26,"[http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/2013/06/r/reddit/) GET UP!!! It's kind of weird that the CDC says, ""A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick, it is useless and I hate it."""
38,27,"> I don't think this is a great quote. This is like how you are on the same page about me as the rest of the other comments (especially from this sub). The one where the husband has a mask is really great, not to mention the one on his face is very weird and you are being a dick. I love it if you can help me, it's really great if I can help you. So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected."

38,37,This isn't really a great quote. This is how the people in this sub are going to get it. I think it's going to be better than the CDC and I think you're gonna be fine. Getting sick is only the end of it.

38,17,My father had a lot of shit about it.
38,19,"A good mask doesn't prevent a person from getting sick, it's useless. A mask can't prevent the infection if it's worn properly or not. The CDC, in their mandate, has to remove the mask in place of the infection. I don't see a difference. The mask is only used for sex. It's used in public for sex as a means of getting sick. It's not for work, and the government can't see it from a distance. So"
38,25,"Why are you guys using your mask for sex, because the CDC is not about it?"
38,26,I'm pretty sure this one quote comes from the CDC. This one is a joke in their defense. They're saying that the CDC is going to remove the mask in place of the disease and that it is useless in preventing a person from getting sick.
38,27,"You're a creep! A lot of people feel that masks are a sex mask. I don't understand why this guy is so resentful of his husband, but he's a creep."
38,30,"A couple years ago, I read that someone I knew was pregnant had got infected and she decided that it was unsafe to wear the mask. It was actually a temporary one. She said that her first thing she did was wear it, but then she went out of her way to wear it when she got sick. Her answer was, ""Ok, I'm fine."" Then she responded, ""I'm really glad you're okay with that, because you said you did not know what was on your face. I don't know what's on your face, and I think the"
38,37,I think the person in question is pretty stupid for his comments. I know I'm a bit old but I would consider this a good idea. I've been there. It's the best thing you could do if you told me the truth.

38,4,"""Have you read anything by the CDC?"""
38,17,It's hard to believe that the CDC is so much more powerful than you think. There are a few things that need to be considered when they think about this. I was just reading the title and thought if you have to believe the CDC's statement then yes it should be in their place.

41,7,''What a fucking idiot to say.
41,8,It sounds like a lot of people don't understand what is'sexist' when it comes to how people define themselves. It's 'not just a question that needs to be addressed'. It's not really about the ACA itself.

41,8,It's a good idea a little controversial to ignore and not completely sexist. Basically that is a bad idea. There is a big problem with the ACA because of the state of California.

41,8,Are you in California? Because I have a bunch of people in there who don't understand why people wear masks. I have had to buy one of these for a couple of years.

41,24,"CANNOTANSWER, the only person who can speak in any tongue of ambiguity, thinks he's not racist and that the ACA is not racist."

41,30,"A man with a mask has been racist for a while, and the state of California, California is one of the most racist states on the US. You could argue that the ACA is racist because it's a very specific piece of legislation, but not because it's being used by a federal body."

43,11,"So he can wear a mask at work, but he won't be wearing a mask at home because it would infected you?"
43,14,"What would you suggest, a good mask would help prevent a person from getting sick."
43,27,"Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat."
43,29,That s a terrible thing to say

43,38,What's your username? You know what my mother is saying:
44,43,>He's going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn't infect anyone else
48,43,In these scenarios if you know your husband is going to need to get the test for your next drive he may have to get an order for you and the wife to have a new mask on you. If he does decide you want to take a test in tight settings you should be able to get a certificate and get it. You can make a new mask and get a new mask and start from scratch. I want to see your picture as a video.

43,1,"A couple years ago my mom would have bought a mask because she was scared of her child. She told me that the kid was going to have to wear a mask because her husband had a really hard time with his own fucked up idea. She then told me that a child can still use a mask in order to stop this. Eventually it stopped and she got sick. I kept saying that her husband is stupid enough to wear a mask.

43,8,I don't understand why some people think they should be wearing a mask to stop the virus. Maybe he just needs a bit more protection in case something goes wrong.

44,31,Vaccines don't work well as a treatment for any type of infection. They can be used as a filter for a parasite. The fact that it's not infectable and isn't infectable. They aren't infectable.

44,8,Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific purpose. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not intended to be used for any specific type of infection.
44,11,"I've always been a sucker for a filter, especially when I'm talking about something that is actually more of a barrier or something, but I've always used it as a barrier. Whether or not it's meant to be used in some way is up to individual personal preferences."
44,15,It's a joke.
44,16,"> I like to think of it as a joke and a joke is a joke. I'm pretty sure this guy isn't even a doctor, just someone with a lot of experience who just doesn't get it."
44,19,"As a mother of a child with an HIV/A virus, my doctor always said - ""Well I'd do it if I wanted to but I have to take my time!"""
44,20,"I read the last sentence. So, I'm going to say ""Well, I'm going to put on a mask, but I don't have one, so that's about it."""
44,31,I don't get it. The CDC is claiming that 'every virus is not infectable' as a general word to be used in a doctor-approved form.
44,40,"The CDC should have some sort of protocol in place that allows the vaccine to be administered by a doctor. That way, if the CDC was right, they wouldn't be used to stop the virus or to try to stop it."
44,43,That's an awful joke.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,> I'm not a funny person. You're not funny. I'm not funny.
44,11,I think this is a fucking joke.
44,15,[NAME] [NAME]](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditMaking/Content/Micro_Vaccine) (https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditMaking/Content/Micro_Vaccine) are two of the CDC's'scientific and useful suggestions' for a vaccine:
44,16,I can't imagine the point of being able to be a doctor because of the virus. But you are right: 'Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific purpose. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for 
44,19,"I read a post about that. I read a couple of posts and said a little ""He's a septic, I've never seen a doctor. He's not going to let me go to a dermatologist to find out what the CDC says."""
44,20,"> I can’t even say the answer, I can’t get into that, because I’m not sure of the specifics of the word."
44,31,Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection.
44,40,"I am going to try a little bit. It is one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through. I've tried a ton of different things. I don't know which ones are the best. But when I get sick I do wear a mask, and it just makes me uncomfortable. I try to be so much more patient when I am sick and I need to stop it."
44,43,"“I think the CDC is being sarcastic. I’m not a doctor and I’m not sure what the joke is about. It’s not funny that they put it on people, who have to think about what they should do. A mask isn’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of fungus,"
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"What does the word ""machete"" mean?"
44,11,"I've got no idea why this guy seems so dreadful, but I think it's time to go. The CDC should have put a vaccine on this guy. That's a very long, long time ago."
44,15,There’s a lot of stuff about this called ‘everyvirus isn’t infectable’ that’s relevant. You don’t need a mask to get sick. If your mask doesn’t protect you you have to get out. Getting sick and getting infected isn’t a good idea.
44,16,You are an idiot. Not even once.
44,19,It sounds like the CDC is overestimating how many people are infected with HIV. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of infection. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of virus.
44,20,"I'm not a joke person, but I don't like being in a joke. I'm saying you are not a dick."
44,31,It’s the worst joke I’ve ever heard. I’m actually glad someone has a sense of humor.
44,40,"""Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of infection."
44,43,"'A lot of people don't have a good sense of humor. Why don't they go to the doctor and find the article about how the virus can cause a rash?', ""(https://www.cdc.gov/about/virginia/virginia/fraud-fem-fraud/article/agdnp-fraud/index.aspx). I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. But I’m not a joke."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,I've seen a couple of comments where this is sarcastic and it's a joke. This is a joke and a sarcastic joke.
44,11,"I'd love to have a friend of mine try a medical mask and then see if they can get you to put on a mask. I know it is a bit of a joke but if it's just a shit joke, I'm not going to wear it."
44,15,"I don't like to think that the CDC is being sarcastic. What they’re doing is a bad idea. A lot of people are putting the CDC down and making themselves feel unhygienic. But there are plenty of people who don't like to think the CDC is being sarcastic. Vaccines aren’t meant to be used for any specific purpose. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they can be used for a specific type of infection."
44,16,"This joke is so awful that it makes it nearly impossible to understand it. This is just one example of how horrible it is. If you want to see a doctor that uses vaccines, you should just do it yourself."
44,19,"I see a lot of people with HIV, it's a problem for the CDC to use masks to prevent viral infection."
44,20,"In an interview a doctor told me in the US that they will put on masks for the flu and people should go to the doctor for it. Vaccines are a vaccinated virus. They can cause spores that infect others. Vaccines can even kill a person if they get into the wrong fungus. So, the guy isn't getting it from me, and that's an extremely serious sign that the infection isn't infected."
44,31,">What I've found funny is that it’s often called a “virginitis spore” which can be contracted through a filter, a fungus or a parasite."
44,40,"I mean... in a sense, I think this is a joke, but you know what is more interesting:"
44,43,"Despite being a very well known infection, and being part of a group of friends who are also infected with HIV, he's still doing it to keep a good life and being on the edge of his seat."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease.
44,11,"It's a joke. They're in a nutshell. A virus can get into the brain when you're out of it (in a nutshell, yes, but not really). They're not a virus but they have a spore (which isn't a virus, I would be surprised if there was a virus that was created there) and aren't meant to be used to prevent an infection. You can also put a septic on and that's when you can't take it out of it a person"
44,15,That's a really good joke.
44,16,"I think a lot of the people that are on the program are either ignorant, uninformed, and do not know what the topic is. Or just aren't aware of what it's like for the CDC."
44,19,"No way a virus can be vaccinated to prevent it. It’s also not meant to be used to fight a virus with anyone, but for treating an infection that causes the virus to be mutated if the virus is present, it’s also not meant to be used for that particular type of virus. Those are specific types of viruses. Vaccines aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of virus. But it’s not the most severe case of infecting"
44,20,I'm pretty sure the CDC doesn't do this in every sense of the word. They're overestimating the number of people with the virus and they're not really concerned with the facts.
44,31,It's been said that these pseudoscientists are putting themselves in a situation where they know how much they need to be in a certain type of situation and then going to a doctor in a specific field to diagnose and treat a virus. So...
44,40,It seems to me like there is nothing wrong with shaming your friend because they 'can't wear a mask'.
44,43,"I read the headline and the article was a joke about a virus, and the guy said, ""Is there a CDC policy that says that I should wear a mask in the bathroom to stop an infection and if it goes to the next doctor?."" It is also a joke about the fact that this person's family is doing it for ""sneakers"" and that ""they are just sick"". So it makes no sense to me that he is wearing a mask, which is why I'm being a joke about a CDC policy. It'"
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,I've got no ideas about why a person should wear a mask. Is it so funny that they want you to wear a mask?
44,11,You sounded like a very smart CDC employee.
44,15,"So... I read the headline and the guy said, ""Is there a CDC policy that says that I should wear a mask in the bathroom to stop an infection and if it goes to the next doctor? "", ""I don't like to think that the CDC is being sarcastic."
44,16,I have a long list of jokes about this and I figured this was a good way to express my views.
44,19,"I know I'm on this side of the spectrum, but I think there's a bit of a disconnect with the CDC. I think the CDC is just trying to mislead people. Those who don't know anything about the CDC are the CDC. They are not putting people in an unsanitary situation that is an indication they are trying to prevent or eradicate an infection if they don't know what to do with them."
44,20,"In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with saying a joke, but in general, the CDC is a bit sarcastic. The ""Masks are not meant to be used for all kinds of things. A mask is not meant to be used for any specific purpose."""
44,31,Vaccines are a type of antiviral drug and thus not infectable. They can be used for any type of disease.
44,40,"A virus can kill a virus and then get mutated into a person. If a person has a virus and does not get the virus then they will infect someone else. A virus is a parasite, which isn’t a parasite. It’s a parasite, which isn’t a parasite. It’s not infectable."
44,43,"'If you put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it's a lot easier to kill a virus than a mask. If you don't want to get infected, you can just make them off, so it's not all you can do."""
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"The question is, is that he or she wants a mask? I don't have one."
44,11,It's a very real question and you're in the right place to ask the right questions.
44,15,"I mean, the jokes of what they're trying to say are stupid."
44,16,"I am a dermatologist. I know that most people do. However, it does seem to me that I don't get that I'm going to be a doctor. I'm not a doctor, I want to be a doctor because I am not going to be a doctor. I just want to be a doctor. I'm not a doctor, just a patient. I want to be able to give you the answers you're looking for. I need to figure out how I can best protect you, but I don't understand this terribly."
44,19,"It's just one of those jokes. It's not that I've always said, ""Have you heard of that?"" I just want to say a few things:"
44,20,I've learned some new stuff from a friend in the US he's referring to. It's a pretty common misconception that vaccines aren't meant to be used for all kinds of things.
44,31,">It’s just like the only thing that’s funny is a doctor. I’m not so much a doctor, but I’m a doctor. I’ve been with people who haven’t had a very good sense of humor."
44,40,The CDC is the one that is putting the CDC in a position to try and prove that the CDC does not have the resources to prevent the treatment of viral infections.
44,43,Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,'Viscosa' is used by the same people that use 'Vosa' to protect against various types of viruses.
44,11,I think he should go see the CDC because he wants to get it figured out.
44,15,"Vaccines are not meant to be used for any specific purpose, unless they can be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they can be used for a specific type of disease. Vaccines are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they can be used for a specific type of disease, like a virus, infect others, or a parasite. Vaccines are not meant to be used for any particular type of disease."
44,16,They're making out with the fact that the people who shit all over themselves are very obnoxious and rude and cling to their opinions. They want to know what's up and when the people who shit about a person are going to get sick or get sick.
44,19,"I can't think of a better term. It's in the sense that we don't use the word ""sneeze"", which refers to the same thing that vaccines have been used for in the past, and not specific to HIV (or any other types of infection, in general), or to the word ""sneeze."" Obviously, it doesn't translate to ""infect."" In other words, the CDC can't give you that. Rather, they should take your advice. They're in no way making a mask. There are very few that"
44,20,"People are going to be dicks, but I'll get it! I don't know if there is a point that says ""I don't want to wear a mask, but I do want to wear a mask,"" or if it's the joke that's making the joke, but I'll say ""Hey, no need for you to make a joke!"""
44,31,Is there a reason to wear a mask to stop an infection? The CDC says so.
44,40,"""If I put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it’s a lot easier to kill a virus and then get mutated into a person. If you don’t want to get infected then they will infect someone else. A virus is a parasite, which isn’t even a parasite. It’s not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable."
44,43,"I've read that people don't have good sense of humor. (I am referring to a joke that was made up and then made up again when I heard this). But I'm not sure if the joke is valid. It's not because I don't like it, it's because I don't like it and I'm not sure what to say."

44,20,Vaccines are used for different things - that is why they have been created and are not meant for a specific purpose.

46,13,So we'll have the next episode:
46,20,The fact that mask protect other people he only cares about himself can make the virus not work is something that doesn't mean I can stop it.
46,32,Mask protect other people he only cares about himself mask protect other people he only cares about himself mask protect other people he only cares about himself
46,37,"I've seen the entire article - from the first time I put it on, it was a picture of a guy that's been wearing a mask for 4 years and he was wearing one for a year after that. I found it to be a little uncomfortable but I still remember the feeling when he wore a mask to protect other people he only cared about himself and was never able to tell."
51,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,2,This is not about the mask.
46,7,"My friend and I wore a mask that came with the first one, one year after she died of an allergic reaction. We didn't realize she was using it to protect other people, but they just said it's just a silly way of thinking about it."
46,13,I still remember the feeling when he wore a mask to protect other people he only cared about himself and was never able to tell.
46,20,What a jerk!
46,32,This is just a common misconception.
46,37,"What was it like when it happened? Because I knew the name of my friend and he didn't want to see me wearing a mask, he was the one who started a virus. He did that because he loved her so much, she wanted her life back and he was all grown up. That guy has no clue what is going on or who is going to be on the Internet, he's been wearing masks for 4 years and I still still love him."
51,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,2,Thats not a good idea. Thats why you get a mask that doesnt let you out of the room. Then try to get out of the room. I'd like to get a mask that doesn't let you out of the room. I just remember wearing masks in the 70s and 80s and still remember that day. What is the mask mask protecting?
46,7,I'm not gonna get any further than this.... and I'm not sure if this has much to do with the fact that people do not know what their health is?
46,13,"I read this in one of the episodes of Doctor Who where I was given a mask for a special occasion. I had no idea this happened, and it did sound like it was a joke. It’s basically saying a guy who is wearing a mask was ""the one who started a virus."" I know this sounds harsh, but I don’t think this is something to be ashamed of."
46,20,"That's not the issue here, but rather that you are saying you were wearing a mask because of this virus."
46,32,How about the fact that masks help stop the spread of the virus?
46,37,"I'm gonna try the ""mask protect other people he only cares about himself"" one. That's just like saying ""What is the mask mask protecting?""."
51,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,2,It's hard to tell if the fact that someone could be exposed to this virus because of the lack of masks does actually change the fact that people actually want to know about the virus. It just doesn't make them that able to be exposed.
46,7,"You know what, that's called [a jerk.](http://www.dc.org/wiki/Hass_Hass_Hass_Hass_Hass_Has_Has_Head) that essentially says that masks do not prevent any sort of transmission of the virus. I'm not sure I'd even believe that if I knew, I'd be able to tell."
46,13,"I'm in a funk and I've been wearing masks for my entire life. My parents got me a mask to hide my sclera in case I had a cold or flu. They thought I was wearing one of those too. I wore a mask in a panic attack, but didn't want to wear one. They wore a mask because the other person's sclera was a very dangerous part of their life, and I had to go to a doctor to remove it for a couple of months. After one of them"
46,20,So your friend got the one from Doctor Who where he didn't think he was the one who started a virus?
46,32,I'm going to try to put this into context. It's an obvious lie that he's wrong to wear a mask because he's not sure what to do with the virus. This means that he's wrong. But I can't tell him that he's a doctor or something. So I'm not going to tell you that you've already told a lie that is true. You're right he did that to protect other people and he did so to make his own choices on his own.
46,37,"This isn't a joke, this is a joke."
51,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,2,"You're right. He's wrong. It's wrong to wear a mask, or that it's not what he is used for, but he's right."
46,7,"The article just stated that ""We are trying to change the way we act. What are you going to do if you aren't sure how to behave?"""
46,13,OP! There is an article in the Guardian about a guy whose mask he was given to protect others is a joke and you should not talk about this shit.
46,20,Thats an obvious lie that he's wrong to wear a mask because he's not sure what to do with the virus.
46,32,"I'm just glad you were able to tell my story, you know I haven't spoken to them."

46,32,"A friend who got a mask for himself for a few months after she got the cold got a virus. She told him that he was afraid of the cold and went to a doctor to see if he was safe. She said she was sure he would die. It's not like she was going to make a big deal about it, though."
46,37,"He is a big jerk. He could have done worse, I could have been like ""Would I let him wear my mask?"" he can have a problem with the virus, and if he was going to be a jerk, then he wouldn't even be going to do a doctor-manipulation."

My cousin got sick and wanted to use one to shield himself - I thought it was a great idea. We ended up with a few weeks of shit, and it is not a joke.

46,2,"It is just an example of how people react to it. That's very strange and depressing, and in the same sentence it is about how the doctor said a friend was a big jerk for wearing a mask."
46,7,It's a joke.

46,7,I don't think this has much to do with the fact that people do not know what their health is?
46,13,"Probably because there are so many people in 'The Daily Show' who think masks don't prevent infection, as in they just masks themselves. But hey, the Daily Show is about preventing the spread of the virus. It's the same as when the guy was in a funk and you had a virus, so you got a fucking scare. He was in a panic attack and then forgot about it until he went to the doctor. Now he's getting it in a fucking joke to keep things in his head when you"
46,20,"This was so funny! I had this idea to keep a friend of mine and my doctor's at a place where he had to get away with it. I used a mask to protect him while his mother was there, despite him getting it away. The doctor then took it off and gave it to the hospital and it worked perfectly. It didn't work, he never really had any problems getting out of it, he just did it and told his mom to fuck it out."
46,32,Probably more of the jokes from the article. I'm going to go back to bed tonight.
46,37,"Unless he was infected with D.C., he was essentially immune to the virus. I think he should put a mask on in case he gets into a funk."

46,37,"I am going to tell you this: When I was in school, I would put on a mask to protect my friend from the virus. It was a joke, but it was a joke and I didn't think I could be embarrassed. He had a problem with the virus, and didn't seem to be able to talk to anyone who would notice. And when I walked away from the doctor, he had just come off. That was the first thing I did.

50,38,"I found out about this at the age of 11 I was in and I've seen the entire story.

He said something like, ""We can't be wrong,"" I would make some bad decisions. I don't know what to do and who to follow, but it's sad that we are in fact all the way out."
50,41,"So did I. I was like, ""No, this isn't a true story, it's a lie"". I said to myself ""I didn't know who he was by that time. I had to find out who he was by that time."" I laughed, I was upset."

50,13,The guy in the video was very angry that you couldn't find out who he was and that was the last thing you wanted to know. You said you were in the same place as him and you didn't realize it was your fault. You said he lied and that's why it is called lying.
