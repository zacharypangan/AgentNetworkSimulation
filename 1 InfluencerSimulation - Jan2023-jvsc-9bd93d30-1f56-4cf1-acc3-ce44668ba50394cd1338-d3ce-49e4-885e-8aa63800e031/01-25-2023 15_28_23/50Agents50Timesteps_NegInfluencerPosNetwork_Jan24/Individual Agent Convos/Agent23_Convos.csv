48,23,"I don't have an answer for you, I'll just tell you."
23,15,How about a second test? Do you need a change of name? Is there something more to it? Is it the only thing that could make you feel better about yourself when you get back home? Is there anything else you can do to improve your quality of life and your health?

48,23,> In these scenarios if you know your husband is going to need to get the test for your next drive he may have to get an order for you and the wife to have a new mask on you.
23,15,"What does it say? I mean, it says there are two kinds of rules."
23,19,"My wife and I will be driving a couple times this weekend, she is very excited and wants to have a driving test, but when they can't, we'll be going back in a few weeks. If they're going to drive, she'll be wearing a mask with her."
28,23,"This isn't a joke. If it's the first time in a month, it's not a big deal. If you have to give permission to other people and the CDC do not allow the public to wear a mask, and if you do, you must provide a notice that it is necessary. This is the correct answer. Do not put yourself in danger, a person with a serious illness will get caught in a shitstorm, and you're an asshole, and can't do anything you're not allowed to do."

23,19,"If I was a registered driver, I'd wear a mask because I can. I'd go ahead and take a second, I'd make it harder for my husband."
28,23,"The word you were looking for here was ""the rule""... in context, they said it as if a person was wearing the same mask over their nose."
