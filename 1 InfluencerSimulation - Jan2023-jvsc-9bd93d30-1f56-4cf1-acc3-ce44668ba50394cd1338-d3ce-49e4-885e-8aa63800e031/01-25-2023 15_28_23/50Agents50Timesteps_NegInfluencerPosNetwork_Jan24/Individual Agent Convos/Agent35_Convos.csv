35,7,hispanics people are not follow the rules by wearing a face mask and social distance during sprinkler water hydran on the street
40,35,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
41,35,as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
35,7,"Its like my mom's mom in texas does the same thing and they say the same thing on the street, the same people wear the same mask on the street, it was just me."
40,35,if he's going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn't infect anyone else
41,35,i had the most helpful stranger in my life who was still using his mask during my first attempt to use it
35,7,"When I'm not with my mom in my area, I see a lot of this stuff that isn't being enforced for me. I'm not saying I should wear a face mask, but that if a person has no facial recognition I can't make them wear the same mask."
40,35,I have an accident that I think he should get a car accident and wear a face mask on his face - a little scary. Especially on the weekends when he's out driving at a party.
41,35,"The question was - are we really allowed to do something like this without an approval process? We need to get rid of people who have used their masks to make an impact. We need to get rid of the idea that if there are no restrictions for them, they will have to be put up with them. If they aren't allowed to do it, we can't expect to get any benefit from them. So no if there are restrictions. This is why you need to ask how it is gonna be."
35,7,"I'd rather not have a problem with him wearing a face mask. It's a much more direct way to get rid of people that've used their masks to make an impact. If it doesn't work, it doesn't have to."
40,35,"And then when he says you don't twitch, he says that you do. It's a shame he hasn't done this before, because he isn't in the right."
41,35,"The amendment says that we do not have to back down on people with masks, but that there is a mandate that we do not."
35,7,"If it doesn't work, it doesn't have to. And then when he says you don't twitch, he says that you do."
40,35,"It's the worst part of sex. He's a dick, and that's a big part of his job, and that he's the only person that does it to me."
41,35,"The same way the law was written in 2009, if it could be repealed, would be ""An Amendment"" which means people need to find out what kind of mask they use."
35,7,I just wanted to say something else:
40,35,CANNOTANSWER:
41,35,"As a man with a mask, it's not so bad. As a Texan, I have a sex drive."
35,7,"[NAME]: as a man with a mask, it's not so bad. As a Texan, I have a sex drive."
40,35,"I'm very young and have a lot of sex at the moment, and this is one of the few situations that I could come up with. If he's doing this to me, it isn't his job to keep me safe, but it doesn't have to be because he wants to spend every day with someone else. That's incredibly annoying and can be a symptom of sex addiction."
41,35,">I'm going to be an idiot if this isn't a legal issue, but I don't think it is the right thing to do."
35,7,"As a Texan, I have a sex drive."
40,35,>He's like the dick of old people: I was a girl who liked women and wanted to have a bit of fun while she was driving.
41,35,"In all seriousness, if this were any other issue, then you are a victim of a racist, anti-Semetic, anti-constitutional, anti-asian, anti-racist, anti-American sentiment. I would have jumped to the conclusion that it would be racist for people to have sex with someone who does that."
35,7,I've never heard that one.
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think that the first sentence is ""He's like the dick of old people: I'm a young man. I was one of those people. I was a girl who liked women and wanted to have a bit of fun while she was driving."""
41,35,"I want to believe this is the ACA amendment. But I am afraid that would lead to a more accurate answer. I am going to be very surprised if it had just started. I am not really saying it's racist, but I think if it is, I will consider it."
35,7,"When I am not with my mom, I see a lot of this stuff that isn't being enforced for me. I'm not saying I should wear a face mask, but that if a person has no facial recognition I can't make them wear the same mask."
40,35,This was the best thing I could come up with.
41,35,"I'm going to be an idiot if this isn't a legal issue, but I think it is the right thing to do."
35,7,"In a similar way, ""I'm a man with a mask, it's not so bad. As a man with a mask, it's not so bad. As a Texan, I have a sex drive."
40,35,"I'm very young, and I have a lot of sex at the moment, and this is one of the few situations that I could come up with."
41,35,"If you are not a black man, you are a racist. A man who is a black man can use a mask and it's not a problem."
35,7,"So the first sentence is ""he's like the dick of old people: I'm a young man. I was a girl who liked women and wanted to have a bit of fun while she was driving."""
40,35,"I feel bad for his mother because she was drunk and he never told me that, but I know that there's a good reason she chose to not do that. She probably used to think it's hilarious that a drunk man is saying that if you're not going to be able to help him you shouldn't be getting sick from an accident. Besides, she's obviously still a bit embarrassed because her daughter is the one who doesn't want to drive."
41,35,"Then this isn't a legal issue. This is why it's important to look for ways to address it. ""As a man with a mask, it's not so bad."" I think it's important to look for ways to address it."
35,7,"CANNOTANSWER: As a man with a mask, it's not so bad. As a Texan, I have a sex drive."
40,35,"And then when he says you don't twitch, he says that you do. It's a shame he hasn't done this before, because he isn't in the right."
41,35,"As a man with a mask, you can use it. If you are racist then you are a racist and a racist. As a Texan with a mask, you are a racist because you can't fuck people who aren't racist."
35,7,"""The other person in this story is a Texan,"" but ""In all seriousness, if this isn't a legal issue, but I think it is the right thing to do."""
40,35,Is it that a doctor explains that he's taking drugs to stop the sex?
41,35,IANAL. But I'm a Texan and a member of the ACA party.
35,7,"[Discrimination is still a legal issue, but the ACA does not stop people from having sex on the street](http://www.tx.gov/discrimination.pdf)"
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER: I know some people who thought the CDC said it was a symptom and not a cure, but they just said it because ""you can get an infected person without even knowing that, right?"""
41,35,[CANNOTANSWER] (http://www.dot.com/r/A_True_Anonymous_A_Number_Condition)
35,7,"The ACA also does not make any changes to the laws against the wearing of a face mask (that is, it’s a legal issue)."
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm going to put it this way. CANNOTANSWER: I believe he is taking a lot of medication to get his daughter to stop using the dick mask, which is called a ""Dick Slash,"" and a ""Dick Shaving"" to make her feel better about the condition. Is it that a doctor explains that he's taking drugs to stop the sex? You mean ""He's a douche, and he does it because he's a dick "
41,35,I think the fact that it's a major issue is something that has a lot of resonance. It's about how people's assumptions about the issue are distorted by the fact that it's being made. I think it's a bad idea.
35,7,The ACA does not make any changes to the laws against the wearing of a mask.
40,35,>[(Statutory)
41,35,IANAL. But I'm a Texan and a member of the ACA party.
35,7,"I'm a young woman with a mask, and I have a sex drive. I also have a sex drive."
40,35,">I see a dick, but I want a fuck. Because it’s a good thing to do."
41,35,"CANNOTANSWER: as a man with a mask, it's not so bad."
35,7,"In a way, the only one that doesn't relate to his own sex drive is that of a man with a mask."
40,35,This was one of the few situations that I could come up with.
41,35,>Is there a problem of ''tapping racism'' as a group of people or as a group of people?''
35,7,"[... It's a shame he hasn't done this before, because he isn't in the right. As a man with a mask, you can use it. If you are racist then you are a racist and a racist. As a man with a mask, you can use it."
40,35,The question was: whose daughter does he want to keep?
41,35,What is this guy referring to?
35,7,"CANNOTANSWER'S THE CANNOTANSWER: I believe he's taking a lot of medication to get his daughter to stop using the dick mask, which is called a ""Dick Slash,"" and a ""Dick Shaving"" to make her feel better about the condition. I think it’s a bad idea. The ACA does not make any changes to the laws against the wearing of a face mask."
40,35,CANNOTANSWER: I believe he is taking a lot of medication to get his daughter to stop using the dick mask. The word is 'dick' (a very common word used in the American sense for dick-shaming).
41,35,I would be quite surprised if it hadn't just started.
35,7,The ACA doesn't make any changes to the laws against the wearing of a mask.
40,35,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_man/sir_and_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_neem_of_and_i
41,35,This is a really cool idea. The idea is to try to be a better human. I would be a little surprised if the law didn't change because it wasn't so controversial.
35,7,"Is the issue not in the law, and if not, is it in the ACA?"
40,35,"Is there a good reason for his wife to decide not to wear a mask? Because, it would be a very easy decision for her, if she is so insecure that she would be so embarrassed."
41,35,"Yes if you're a Texan, you're going to be a racist and you're a racist. If I'm not a Texan, I'm a racist."
35,7,>The ACA does not make any changes to the laws against the wearing of a mask.
40,35,I don't have much of a solution for you.
41,35,"IANAL. But I'm a Texan and a member of the ACA party. The ACA has been drafted and the government has to keep it up. What do you mean by ""no one can put a mask on public sanity""?"
35,7,What about the woman in the first picture?
40,35,"A lot of people thought it was a disease and not a cure, but they just said it because ""you can get an infected person without even knowing that, right?"","
41,35,That's a question that's going to be answered in the future.
35,7,"As a Texan, I don't think this is illegal."
40,35,"CANNOTANSWER: 'Some of these people s....... I really think you're just trolling. You are in the wrong place. Vaccines aren't meant for any specific purpose, unless they can be used for a particular type of disease, like a virus, infect others, or a parasite. Vaccines can be used as a filter to prevent infection, which is very rare. There isn't enough time to protect yourself."
41,35,The only reason a black man can put a mask on public sanity is because he isn't a black man.
35,7,"This is the type of comment I'm going to ask my mother and her son about how they're going to be going through a hard time to find a solution to the ""dick shaming"" and the ""dick slash"" that is being used by all Texans on the street."

35,7,You need to go a few miles.

41,35,"I mean, I would think it's a good idea if it were just a joke. I could be making fun of a man whose dick shattered when he jumped into the ACA if he did that. Maybe I'm wrong but I still don't think it's racist because he's not a racist, and a racist if he's not."
35,7,"If that's what you think it's for, you need to talk about it - it's a fucking joke - but this isn't something I can support."
40,35,"Vaccines aren't meant for any specific purpose, unless they can be used for a specific type of disease, like a virus, infect others, or a parasite. Vaccines can be used as a filter to prevent infection, which is very rare."
41,35,The people with a mask aren't just being racist and a problem in themselves. They are doing it as a social experiment that aims to prevent it.
35,7,"""Dick Shaving"" - a sex drive based on a sexual attraction to women in public. Those are sex drives that people use and those are sex drives that they enjoy. I think it's a little extreme but not really a joke to make fun of a man with a mask."

41,35,"I'd love to see a more honest and helpful person about how to avoid this sort of thing. I was wondering if the ACA's effect on racial awareness is one of the things that made the ACA possible for blacks to vote for, or if it was made to effect them.... I think it's racist because he is not a racist and a racist and a racist because he is not a racist. I think it's a good idea, but I think it's the right thing to do."

35,7,"As a person with a mask, it's not a legal issue, and it's illegal to be in public, but you should probably be able to go to the health department and ask how to be in public, as the person will be talking about what you are doing, which will involve all those involved.
