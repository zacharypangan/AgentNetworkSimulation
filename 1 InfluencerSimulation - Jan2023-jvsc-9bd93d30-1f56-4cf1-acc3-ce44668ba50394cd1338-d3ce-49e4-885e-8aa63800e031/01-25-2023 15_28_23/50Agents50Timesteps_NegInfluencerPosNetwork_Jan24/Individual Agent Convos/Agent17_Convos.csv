26,17,if you flagrantly disregard public health guidance and refuse to wear a mask you shouldn t be allowed treatment at all let alone top tier treatment the rest of america can t access
31,17,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
34,17,continuing to mask up amp distance reduces the transmission of the virus amp if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
38,17,hi everyone plz just wear a mask i don t wanna be unemployed again
40,17,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
17,1,Thanks. For the sake of our safety I'd suggest wearing a mask.
17,2,"i hate that people have to go wearing masks to keep the virus from getting in their system. that's like saying something stupid that could happen in a movie, but a lot of people aren't."
17,9,There's a movie about a man with a cock tattoo named “Torn to Kill” starring Ben Stiller. It's a good movie and you’re right that it was just directed at me.
17,12,This is an interesting concept. The masks are not necessary if you want to take out the virus.

26,17,"I have a mask, but I don't wear it and it won't let me see the doctor unless I want to. I think you need to have a health - care professional that genuinely knows about the benefits and benefits to the patient. That s why it can't be covered by the medics, as many doctors say."
31,17,What part of the state is he coveting?
34,17,"The vaccines will help prevent the spread, but it will take a while for vaccines to be effective. Also if it is too painful, the medical community will take a LOT of time to work out what a vaccine does for a virus"
38,17,I am a new guy and never wear masks. They look pathetic and mean and annoying.
40,17,Yeah but he has to stop. he can do something so that people can just ignore him and keep them in their life.
17,1,"He's not a health care professional, and he's not willing to take care of you. You're not paying for your medical bills."
17,2,You're assuming that they aren't a good movie for the whole situation and the story is about how a woman's face mask causes someone's cock tattoo to show they aren't a good person.

17,12,A lot of people wear masks at a certain point in their lives.

26,17,"This is a big question for anyone who cares about the shady industry. I have a mask, but I don't wear it and it won't let me see the doctor unless I want to.

31,17,I think a statewide mask mandate is a really illogical and bad idea.
34,17,"I don't understand why he'd need to go out of his way to make a new mask for his wife, but in order to make the new one he needs to wear the mask himself and that he can help the person who has the disease to stop him from getting sick."
38,17,"It sounds like this guy is a good guy, and he is a good guy."
40,17,He's just making a point. He can stop. He needs to stop. He can do something so that people can just ignore him and keep them in their life.
17,1,"That's a very good idea. This is a huge topic that will only get better. The idea is to prevent health care from being provided at a level where people do not have a proper right to complain or worry about things. I would advise that you seek treatment. And even then, I'm pretty sure you should do it. It may have some serious benefits."
17,2,"i have a lot of shady friends and wear masks. I don't think I need to be a medic to wear a mask, but I want to wear a mask if i have to and I don't want to go to the doctor. i'm gonna be scared of the virus that is going to get in my system. i don't want to go outside because i have nothing to be concerned about. i want my mask to work for me and not just cause the virus to get in the way."

31,17,I think this is a really bad idea.
34,17,"There's nothing inherently wrong with wearing a mask. What you wrote was based on a theory that the disease spreads quickly and does not take as long as it's shown in an opportunistic, immature way. It can be useful in a medical environment and it can be very useful in preventing illness and it could help the person who has the disease."
38,17,Tell me something funny about you:
40,17,"If he is trying to stop snooping, then that's a blatant lie."
17,1,"The 'Sir/MaskHirs' ep has the first name of a shady guy I've met, and I'm pretty sure that's exactly what she is looking for."
17,2,"I think he is blatantly snooping, and he's taking money away from himself."
17,9,I think the guy's trying to stop snooping is a blatant lie. Especially since he is just trying to convince people he can do something to stop it.
17,12,"He doesn't want to make you sick because you have no health insurance. And even if he does, he has no right to do so. That's not a good idea. I'm so glad he made you a better person."

31,17,"I'd like to add that ""We do not like the government to let other people see our masks and go to them on the street."" Does that make the other parties more resentful of the man if he doesn't act like a racist, but is also not racist? Or would that make him a racist?"
