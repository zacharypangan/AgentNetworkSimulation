30,18,... I have done this with the people who are in charge and i know how it goes. you gotta make your own masks. I'm saying that you will not get infected with the virus in a real sense and you won't get a good conversation from someone who is sick. I would also say that having a mask isn't good enough to prevent a lot of sick people from actually coming to the hospital or any clinic. I am afraid that your wife can’t take responsibility for your child’s safety.
