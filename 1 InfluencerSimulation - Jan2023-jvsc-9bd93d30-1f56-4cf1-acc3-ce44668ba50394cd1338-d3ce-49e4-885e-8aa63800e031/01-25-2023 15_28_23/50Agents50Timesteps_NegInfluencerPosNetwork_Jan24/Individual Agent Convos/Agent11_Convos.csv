11,2,"i can't believe it was an actual post, as i don't really read it much. i read a whole book about the mask that isn't real and that i think is pretty fucked up though"
11,3,I read that you can still buy a mask at the door....but I tbh he will need a mask. I tbh.
11,6,It does get harder to live in a mask because we all know that's the wrong way to live.
16,11,If you are going to get covid you need to get a helmet.
43,11,Thank you for asking. I really don't see how he's going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask.
44,11,I don't really know anything about this. You should probably reread that section of the article.
45,11,i have no idea how to answer that i am so late. the drive up test is on you tomorrow. you will need to have it a few hours to get through.

45,11,What do you do? Do you ever have a friend who works in a private company? Or do they want to get a private one?
11,2,oh and in all honesty I don't really think we've done anything about it. There is a lot of talk of getting a private mask because it's not worth the hassle and effort to get it.
11,3,"So he can wear a mask at work, but he won't be wearing a mask at home because it would infect you?"
11,6,"I just learned that there is a large number of people who have not used masks yet in their lifetime. I mean, the guy you mentioned has a very active history of syphilis. So I think it could be a more accurate description of the situation than this: ""It can get harder to live in a mask because we all know that's the wrong way to live."" (as opposed to ""i'm really not sure how that has any practical application.)."
