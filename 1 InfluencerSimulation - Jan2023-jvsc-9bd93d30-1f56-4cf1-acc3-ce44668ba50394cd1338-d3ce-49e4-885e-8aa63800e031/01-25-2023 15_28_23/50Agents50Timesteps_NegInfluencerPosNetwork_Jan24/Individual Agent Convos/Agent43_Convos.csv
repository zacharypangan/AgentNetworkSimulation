43,34,"I would say that if his mouth is closed at the time he will feel really unsafe if it becomes a habit, he'll get sick and should be put down immediately. It's also not worth mentioning that he does not have a mask and has been in danger for a long time."

44,43,"if you put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it's a lot easier to kill a virus than a mask. if you don't want to get infected, you can just make them off, so it's not all you can do."

So... how does he get sick and get back to the room?"
43,11,"So he can wear a mask at work, but he won't be wearing a mask at home because it would infected you?"
43,14,"What would you suggest, a good mask would help prevent a person from getting sick."
43,27,"Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat."
43,29,That s a terrible thing to say

48,43,In these scenarios if you know your husband is going to need to get the test for your next drive he may have to get an order for you and the wife to have a new mask on you. If he does decide you want to take a test in tight settings you should be able to get a certificate and get it. You can make a new mask and get a new mask and start from scratch. I want to see your picture as a video.

43,1,"A couple years ago my mom would have bought a mask because she was scared of her child. She told me that the kid was going to have to wear a mask because her husband had a really hard time with his own fucked up idea. She then told me that a child can still use a mask in order to stop this. Eventually it stopped and she got sick. I kept saying that her husband is stupid enough to wear a mask.

43,14,The whole thing sounds like a joke.
43,27,"I think a good joke is a joke, but a great joke would also be a joke."
43,29,That is actually quite interesting. The joke about having a virus infected is the kind of thing that happens when you don't have a mask. That's part of why I don't like the idea of being the worst person to get a virus. Is that it's the type of thing that we don't want to be that bad? What would happen if I wore a mask?
