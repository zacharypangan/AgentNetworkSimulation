10,9,"I think that people need to learn to put on masks because they get sick of the virus and think that they are safe and should be safe.

But I think that is why I say to people. I gotta wear a mask. I need to stop looking like I have a crank face mask so"
24,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

28,10,Basically a hat would fit over my head.
30,10,"I don't wear a mask, but I hardly ever go there. I am afraid to see people in my home and I am afraid of people who are hiding behind the masks."
33,10,Isn't that an option for preventing the pandemic?
40,10,I think you deserve a fair share of that.

27,10,I've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a face mask.
28,10,"You could say the same thing in a similar voice on the radio show (and in that post), but I never heard it."
30,10,... I have done this with the people who are in charge and i know how it goes. you gotta make your own masks.
33,10,"No, they do not. No one in this sub would know about this. It just doesn't help. This is about to change. You're already doing something right."

27,10,I've been looking for a reason to avoid wearing a mask to get help from a doctor.
28,10,">We should have a mask over our noses"": do not wear them."
30,10,I have a friend like that. She says she likes the idea of a mask in her home. She wants to talk about how the government was trying to make her sick. I think she feels very much the same way about the idea of a mask and not to put it on.

33,10,So when someone wears a mask and gets sick it's not an issue with you. They're just afraid to be honest about it. If you do what's right it's going to be done for you and your wife.
40,10,"I'm sorry, but you have been to a lot of sex this past week and it is hard to be with someone like this. And while this isn't a solution to the problem, do you have a solution?"
51,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

28,10,"I think it's a real question, no matter how you define it. If I don't care what others think I'm going to do, I have no problem with that. You sound like a nice person.
