10,9,"I think that people need to learn to put on masks because they get sick of the virus and think that they are safe and should be safe. And you know what, I don't see how anyone will know that people have a right to wear a mask because it is a form of protection, so it would be like saying ""I should never wear a mask and I need to wear a mask instead of a mask. But I think that is why I say to people. I gotta wear a mask. I need to stop looking like I have a crank face mask so"

17,9,There's a movie about a man with a cock tattoo named “Torn to Kill” starring Ben Stiller. It's a good movie and you’re right that it was just directed at me.
27,9,Why do you want to be unemployed again? Why can't you just have someone that knows how to use their masks and not be embarrassed about wearing them?
42,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
50,9,I grew up in the same place as this man. I had to find out who he was by that one time.

17,9,"I have a mask, but I don't wear it and it won't let me see the doctor unless I want to. I think you need to have a health care professional that genuinely knows about the benefits and benefits to the patient. That's why it can't be covered by the medics, as many doctors say. What part of the state is he coveting? The vaccines will help prevent the spread, but it will take a while for vaccines to be effective."

42,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
50,9,There are two main reasons why it's not a good idea to read these types of things:
10,9,"It is extremely cliche to say ""Hey! We can just talk about safety and safety first. We can also talk about our medical status and health.

17,9,I think that the story sucks because people get repressed and smug so quickly and they can't get sick enough to see the doctors on the street.
27,9,"In my opinion, if he was making a crappy move, then the CDC is not a constitutional amendment. In the US, the government is not authorized to remove masks, but does allow an adult to wear them in public."
