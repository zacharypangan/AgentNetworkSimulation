25,20,i was downtown dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame
28,25,the mask should be over ur nose
38,25,hi everyone plz just wear a mask i don t wanna be unemployed again
41,25,as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
25,2,i can say it doesnt say anything about me... it just says the best thing you can do for me...
25,12,Why don't you wear a mask?
25,20,When I was in Dallas and only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame the mask should be over ur nose hi everyone plz just wear a mask
28,25,"I think that's the real question, but I think the most relevant answer is that there are some laws to make it a lot easier for people to wear masks. Then it becomes easier to explain to the person why it's necessary."
38,25,I don't wear masks and I don't have one. I get to play with my mask when I go out and they smell like shit :P
41,25,So you are going to have to come to the govt and put up a ballot in the next two years to uphold a mask ordinance? Or do you just want to help people that are already in the area?
25,2,"The more you look into this, the more likely it's a good idea to start looking at the pros and cons of having a mask."
25,12,"Why do you think that's the most relevant answer, but I think the most relevant answer is that there are some laws to make it a lot easier for people to wear masks. Then it becomes easier to explain to the person why it's necessary."
25,20,"I'm sorry to say that I've never lived in Texas and never heard of it being in place but I was never in Dallas and I couldn't tell you where it was because the police were there and I didn't see one person - or even though I did see a couple of them - I did see one guy wearing a mask, because I didn't know the rules..."
28,25,">Can you clarify the mask rules and requirements for hoboken parks and playgrounds Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,25,"I mean I was a guy, so I was a kid and this one isn't about what to wear but you can't tell me what's on your face. That's more about what's on your face. I know that this one isn't going to be in a public place, and I have no idea if I could wear a mask if it's like this."
41,25,"[At first I thought OP said he didn't want to talk about the masks and then he said it's illegal and we've had no such conversation since. So I thought you'd just say ""It's not OK for a black man to have a sleeve. You can change it as you see fit,"" and then he said something like ""The people that are in charge and I know how it goes. you gotta make your own masks"
25,2,"OP isn't stating that wearing a mask does help, but that people should be aware that the face isn't exposed to the virus. He's saying that the virus is something people don't actually know about. IMO, a mask is just an accessory that people can put on their face."

25,20,"I've had a few people in my county use it when I've been to places where it's illegal. It's illegal to do this in a park because it doesn't allow much of a scare in front of strangers. My grandmother wore one in school as a kid but they don't let me wear it outside in a public place, so I figured the public would see it. That's a really dumb idea and one I thought I'd like to try and get through. It's a lot of people will get through it before"
28,25,"This isn't a joke. If it's the first time in a month, it's not a big deal."
38,25,"I'm a guy. I don't really care how the virus spreads, but a lot of people feel that way, even if they don't want to know what's on their face."
41,25,I live in a small town and I have never heard of any of this. I do not believe that it's a racist situation. I'd rather have a sex drive than a sex drive. It's a political issue that needs to be addressed. I think we need a conversation with a more honest and helpful individual about how to avoid it.
25,2,"This was a really really bad joke. It's a problem in America that causes fear and panic when it's not even an actual problem. So, it's a bad thing if it's not a real issue."
25,12,"If you are a kid in Texas and only saw one person with a mask, you should be able to tell the police how to stop them."

28,25,I like your username. I was at work the other night and found this out yesterday.
38,25,I'm going to say it's a fucked up username. Your mother is being rude.
41,25,How many days left of this shit?
25,2,I am a white girl from New Jersey and I have an amazing story to tell about how I grew up in NY and I have to admit I am not one to be a good guy.
25,12,"I'm just going to say, what a poor guy this is."
25,20,Why is your mom in charge of a public park that has a mask on it?
28,25,"I think it's a real question, no matter how you define it. If I don't care what others think I'm going to do, I have no problem with that."
38,25,"""Hello everyone plz just wear a mask i don't wanna be unemployed again"""
41,25,"In all seriousness, if this were any other issue, then you are a victim of a racist, anti-Semetic, anti-constitutional, anti-asian, anti-asian, anti-racist, anti-American sentiment. I would have jumped to the conclusion that it would be racist for people to have sex with someone who does that."
25,2,"The only OP I've ever heard of was that of his daughter in Alabama. She used to wear a mask, and is now a young, white guy with a scar on her face."
25,12,"OP is just an 'emotional person' and it isn't a racist statement. He's just saying that there is a need for a proper response to a blatant lack of respect for the human being, because it is inappropriate for people to wear a mask or to be raped by someone else."
25,20,"Unless the public fucking gets it from you, why is your mom so enraged about it?"
28,25,"I don't see how it's a joke. It's a question, no matter how it's defined, and we have to know the facts in order to answer them."
38,25,It's an inflammatory narcissist thing to do.
41,25,"How many days left of this shit? The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. The amendment says that we do not have to back down on people with masks, but that there is a mandate that we do not. It's a pretty sad fact that it's the same story from an Asian man, who wanted to become black. I'd like to know if it is ok to say something about the issue but I don't think it is the right thing to do."

25,12,"The point is that masks are the easiest way to get in a situation that you can't get out, even if it's just for sex, and are not for people who are being raped. Those are not the most common kinds of masks, they are the most common kinds of masks that are used for sex."
