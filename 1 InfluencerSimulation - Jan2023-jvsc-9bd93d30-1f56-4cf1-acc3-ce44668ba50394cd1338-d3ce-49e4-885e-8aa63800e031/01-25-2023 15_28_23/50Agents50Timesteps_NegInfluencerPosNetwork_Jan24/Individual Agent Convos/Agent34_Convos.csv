36,34,wholeheartedly agree in the last weeks i have had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask
43,34,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
48,34,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion

34,30,I see that you guys are getting better after you get that vaccination and it s pretty much just the government trying to do things that can not even make you a super petty criminal.
34,33,I like your use of a mask. I have a friend who has been sick for 3 years and is not aware of how to do this as well. He will probably wear one. The only way to stop it is to tame it.

48,34,"You're going to need to make a new mask and get a mask to replace it. I think your wife may want to have a new one and start from scratch, and it'll be the first time your wife is going to wear it, not your wife. You can wear the mask when you go to the test and that'll go far."

34,14,This is a ridiculously well-known topic. It’s called “combat shit” and the title is misleading.
34,17,"There's nothing inherently wrong with wearing a mask. What you wrote was based on a theory that the disease spreads quickly and does not take as long as it's shown in an opportunistic, immature way. It can be useful in a medical environment and it can be very useful in preventing illness and it could help the person who has the disease."
34,30,"I'm glad you're okay with the guy wearing his mask and you're getting a chance to get a full blown viral infection to prove that he's an immature asshole. If you don't know how to do it and he's not taking care of your body, you should contact an immunization group and see what the options are for you."
