37,32,truth is there s a lot of differing opinions and plenty of studies that say they do help the real problem is that most of the people who are anti mask are just doing it to be jackasses instead of trying to be considerate

37,32,"I've already said the same thing to a friend. This isn't a good idea. This is not the kind of situation I want to be in. I'd like to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't have the virus. This is not going to work, but there is a huge stigma surrounding it."

49,32,"I've been driving with my girlfriend for 6 years and she's doing just fine. I'm not sure she's going to let me drive it unless she's absolutely crazy, though she can probably get it over with. The car has an insurance policy in it, which doesn't matter if you are a registered driver. You've gotta give her the number and the address to make sure she's still a registered driver, but her address should still be in the driver's file. I would make sure to go for it."

42,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,32,I'm going to try to put this into context. It's an obvious lie that he's wrong to wear a mask because he's not sure what to do with the virus. This means that he's wrong. But I can't tell him that he's a doctor or something. So I'm not going to tell you that you've already told a lie that is true. You're right he did that to protect other people and he did so to make his own choices on his own.
