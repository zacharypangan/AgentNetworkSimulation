50,41," I had a few days left. I had to find out who he was by that one time. I have only a few days left.  Wow, this is the last one in my head."
50,47,"What is the implication of the story? It means one person is not the only one, I can't imagine it."
50,9,The story in the link is about what happened to his wife and that woman who was in a ballot recount center.
50,13,"""I think I've got a lot to do but I'll do it again"" (no link, y'know)"
50,18,"I think the same thing happened with my ex when we were kids. Obviously we didn't know who he was until he was born. I just knew that we knew a man, and my mom wanted to find out who he was. Then I had a misunderstanding."
50,21,"It means one person is not the only one, I can't imagine it."
50,38,"I found out about this at the age of 11 I was in and I've seen the entire story. I've only heard a few of the same lines and it's funny because he said that he was'mom' and it's a bad thing that people are so ignorant. I would rather he was a better person. He said something like, ""We can't be wrong,"" I would make some bad decisions. I don't know what to do and who to follow, but it's sad that we are in fact all the way out."
50,41,"So did I. I was like, ""No, this isn't a true story, it's a lie"". I said to myself ""I didn't know who he was by that time. I had to find out who he was by that time."" I laughed, I was upset."
50,47,I read this once. I cant get enough of this story.
50,9,I thought that was a remark.
50,13,"I just read the whole story. The first implication of the story is that he was a person that was a jerk, he had no control over the rest of his life. That's like saying I was a kid, but that is a jerk."

50,21,"I don't think you'll find the answers you need. You don't know. The only answer is he did it to you, not to you. You need to find out. That's a good one."
50,38,"""That's just not a true story. If I had an issue with it I would find out what to do with it and that's how I can fix it."""
50,41,There are two main reasons why it's not a good idea to read these types of things:

50,13,The guy in the video was very angry that you couldn't find out who he was and that was the last thing you wanted to know. You said you were in the same place as him and you didn't realize it was your fault. You said he lied and that's why it is called lying.

50,41,"He has a history of being a jerk, and he wants you to stop being a jerk? Isn't that a great deal of his work?"
50,47,I don't think you have any way to make a true story out of your ex. The question is why.
50,9,There are two main reasons why it's not a good idea to read these types of things:
50,13,Is this a joke?
50,18,"“No, this isn’t a true story, it’s a lie”."
50,21,I think this isn't a true story.

50,38,"I was born a couple of years ago. I have been living with this guy for two years now. He still has a lot to do but he's not a jerk. He was one of the first guys to ever leave me at home. He still has some friends from when I was around. He's a pretty good guy, but I don't think he's the best for a good friend. I think I have an interesting history with him - he used to be one of my first few times before he died in 2003."
50,41,"A man like you is not your man. I think that 'I'll do it again' may be a little unfair and demeaning to some people, but I know I didn't know who he was."

50,18,I think a good one.
50,21,This guy is just a jerk.
50,38,"So, he's saying ""Mom's not wrong,"" ""Mom's not right,"" and he's saying ""we can't be wrong."" So, he's saying he didn't know who he was at 11? And then he didn't think it was a good idea to say ""Another guy was."""
50,41,"I read this a few years ago, and it's like saying ""I had a friend that didn't want to see me and I was really upset because I was in a different place than you and couldn't find out who he was by that time."""
50,47,"I think you’re missing the point. I think it’s a good idea to think about your own experiences. In my experience a man who is an asshole with an unusual personality is in a lot of relationships with other men and sometimes it’s all about personal preferences, but he just wants to make you feel he has to be. That is a fucking bully."
50,9,"I have read that it says ""I do this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center."" (and my point was that this isn't a true story.)"
50,13,"I think it's worth noting that his comments seem like ""just a joke"". And if he wants to make you feel better about yourself for it, you have to accept that it's more a fucking joke than a joke, so I'll just make the same comment again."
50,18,"Is this a joke? “No, this isn’t a true story, it’s a lie.”"
50,21,"I'm sorry. This was the beginning of something that had me in a really bad position: ""I don't know who he is, but I'm glad that he's gone now. I know he will be coming to a point where I don't really feel that the need for his words is important,"""
50,38,What if he told you he was wrong? He lied and he is not a jerk?
