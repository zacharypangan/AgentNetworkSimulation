98,94,"The first one is the one of the movies that starts with [[NAME] starring [NAME] on ""Jack]"" and ends with ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows ""."
98,16,The other half is the one with Jack starring Michael Bay.
98,58,i know i haven't smoked a cigarette since i was 12 years old
98,61,And when you wear a mask you don't actually have to worry about losing it in the future.
98,87,I was just watching that one the other day because I couldn't believe that it was written by the actor who played it and I wasn't surprised it was written by him he couldn't believe it because I don't know who the actor was or what he wrote but he was a pretty sweet guy!
98,88,"This is just like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning. I don't even look at her face, but she's always saying something that sounds pretty cool to me."
98,94,I'm gonna go back and watch the movie The first one. It's just a bit boring.

98,58,:( ::) I think that is a great answer :) I am a doctor and have not smoked a cigarette since I was 12 years old
98,61,"Ahhh, I figured out why I was in the first one."
98,87,There is a joke about this one about wearing a mask to scare people
98,88,"So, you like wearing a mask because you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows you like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows"
98,94,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,16,It's the only place I can say that's true. I also know what he's like.
98,58,I hate when people say that if a person is going to be a doctor they would want to wear a mask to scare people.
98,61,I think that is a great answer :) I am a doctor and have not smoked a cigarette since I was 12 years old
98,87,There's the one with Jack that's pretty cool.
98,88,I think that is a great answer :) I am a doctor and have not smoked a cigarette since I was 12 years old And when you wear a mask you don't actually have to worry about losing it in the future.
98,94,"It is not a troll comment, but it's a fact and not a political comment. Is it possible that it's part of the measures deployed by the government?"
98,16,I don't know how much a cigarette doesn't really scare anyone.
98,58,"It's not a troll comment, but it's a fact and not a political comment."
98,61,I want to know if you can tell me what it is like to be a doctor and not smoke a cigarette?
98,87,I think that 'The One With Jack' has one of the best and most entertaining stories that I have heard in years if not years. It is a great piece of literature that I think can give a lot of context for a joke like that.
98,88,I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because
98,94,I have a bad idea of how to wear a mask unless you are a doctor. That is the joke. I want you to know that your body is a symbol of a virus.
98,16,I think it's more like you want to know that your body is a symbol of a virus.
98,58,A friend of mine smoked a cigarette and died as a result. I think she was a little bit scared and that was a part of her job.
98,61,Weirdest line ever.
98,87,"This is all a troll comment, and it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
98,88,I think it's a great answer because i'm gonna have to ask myself if I can help you with anything besides my face.
98,94,"The article says that it is not a political comment, but that it is possible that it's part of the measures deployed by the government."
98,16,"I think the other joke is that ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with"
98,58,"I mean that cigarette is still a symbol of a virus, and if that was what you think you want to be a doctor without, it would be a joke. It's not a troll comment. It's a fact and not a political comment."
98,61,"It sounds like the government needs to tell people what it is like to be a doctor, and that it will help."
98,87,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,88,What's the point of wearing a mask? Because i don't have any cigarette. The point of wearing a mask is to protect me. I don't really care how much you wear a mask. I think it's a great answer.
98,94,"I read this article about the use of a mask that's a joke. Basically: ""I hate when people say that if a person is going to be a doctor they would want to wear a mask to scare people."

98,16,"I've read this article, and I love it. I'm always afraid to say it. I like wearing a mask, but don't want to be a troll."

98,16,"There are many reasons to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses. They include a ""histamine mask,"" or a ""skin mask"" because you can't get a fake cigarette out."
98,58,"I just got an online version of this article. It's called ""The Affair of the American Medical Society"" and is a 'fact and not a political comment'. It's not a troll comment, but it's a fact and not a political comment."
98,61,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,87,"I think that people are 'too big' for the federal government to get involved with trolls, even though they might be not so big a fan of any of those jokes."
98,88,The fact that the government has used a disguise to scare people is ridiculous.
98,94,You are a fucking nut.
