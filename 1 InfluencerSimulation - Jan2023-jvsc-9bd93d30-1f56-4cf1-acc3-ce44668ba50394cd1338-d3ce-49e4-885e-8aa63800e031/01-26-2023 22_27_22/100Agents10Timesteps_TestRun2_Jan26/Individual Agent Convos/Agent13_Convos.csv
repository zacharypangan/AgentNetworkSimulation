72,13,I am afraid that you can't live with a mask. I can't stand the thought of the other party wearing a mask and being able to walk around with a hand grenade.
73,13,And it seems that his supporters seem to be embracing it and that the support for it and not the law or the government in general seems to be in place.

47,13,>To protect myself from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion.
59,13,When I visited Tx I found out that a number of things were happening on the scene - one of them was a group of sick kids who came to their local park because they thought it was a good idea to wear a mask.
61,13,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
72,13,I was very sick from having to get the mask on because I didn't even know the mask acted like a dummy.
73,13,My husband is on a mask. He doesn't really have it. I'd rather not wear it.
83,13,"I'm not familiar with the meaning of this, but it sounds like you're in a situation where you think a person is a virus in which they don't realize that a virus is a virus."
86,13,"I just realized how scary it is that Santa had to wear the helmet in the snow, and the fact that that didn't stop it from circulating."
13,5,"The whole thing is ridiculously ridiculous. Basically, any human being can get a virus, and the government can't stop it. The only way to stop it is to just wear a mask to protect themselves."
18,13,What if I wear a mask for a race?
22,13,People who have never heard of the ''walking mask '' and then put on a mask are actually people who had not yet seen the mask in their daily lives. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,13,"In this case, the person is going to have to be vaccinated for a month before she can begin to develop a virus."
44,13,"I just want to add that if people wearing masks are attempting to prevent the spread of a virus, they are failing to do the right thing. The problem is that there is not enough information available that people can use."
45,13,"It's not a good idea, but it's a better idea."
47,13,"> but in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
59,13,"Well, I can't really speak for all these children who are vaccinated because they have never been on an airborne pandemic vaccine, so it's not really all that different from what they wear, I think."
61,13,"A little too sweeping, but true. You're too old to get vaccinated, and you're still not able to recover from the virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help you. It will actually protect you from the virus."
72,13,The phrase wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,13,"I see what you mean, but what you have not said is that he is a dick-faced person. It sounds like you have a lot to hide."
83,13,The government is the one that makes the choice to be infect a sick person's mind.

18,13,"This joke is so long gone, it's not funny, its just not as funny."
22,13,"If the problem isn't with a person's safety, the problem is with a person's health. Those people need to stop using their masks."
37,13,"I'm a lawyer, so it's important to understand that it doesn't matter that your child isn't getting the vaccine. There is no mandate to vaccinate her as soon as possible. In addition, if she doesn't get vaccinated, she won't be able to get the vaccine."
44,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's funny that so many people in the U.S. don't wear a mask at their job, but there's a very glaring difference between them and the other one."
45,13,"You said a'mask protects other people he only cares about himself', but you're just going to have to put your head out of your mouth to have a safe place to get checked out. It's all right."
47,13,A lot of people don't care for what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
59,13,"The most important part of this story in my experience is that you can't just wear a mask for the purpose of preventing someone from getting sick if they are vaccinated. I mean, I mean, I'm not sure what's wrong, but I'm definitely sure there's a better way to look out for the fap test in the US."
61,13,This is pretty clear cut and I'm not sure what to get out of it.
72,13,I think this is the kind of article that you would write on a paper. People aren't saboteurs.
73,13,"Its not what it is, its what it is. AIDS is not an infectious disease. If there is a virus it can be spread very easily. Its because it's not a virus that's been shown to be prevalent."
83,13,"You mean I have the right to wear a mask? Because in fact I’ve been on a fecal disease list for a number of years, and my first child has been on the list. They have a law where they wear a mask, when they can get one, and then they’re on a list for years. They say I’ve had one infection (the CDC and NIH), and then I was on it, for weeks at most, and it’s been all over the place for two years. I’m just curious about the legality of"
86,13,"This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again'. I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use this."
13,5,So what do you think of the fact that the government doesn't want to get a vaccinated person on the list because she was on the list for a few years?
18,13,Is a mask a tool used to prevent virus infection?
22,13,"I have always admired how people have changed over the years. I have a mask to protect me from being killed, but that is because it can be worn to keep me from being bitten. I've seen some people with a mask before. They are also able to do things while I'm flying. They know that they are sexy, but not for a long time. That's why they put on a mask while being vaccinated. They don't think about the health of the person, that they have to change the fact that they aren'"
37,13,"It's just a big problem, and it's going to be pretty hard to see how things are going to get more dangerous in a short amount of time. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure people will want to try to harrass them."
44,13,if the government doesn't want to help prevent a virus from spreading.
45,13,"It's about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
47,13,You gotta be very careful in the face of the CDC.
59,13,"This is a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
61,13,I think this post is a good one to start.
72,13,>I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
73,13,I've heard a couple of these people and their husband's wives say it isn't the right thing to do. The fact that they aren't aware of the problem is just another example of what might be happening.
83,13,It's a government mandate and they know it.
86,13,You do have a point. You don't have a point. You have a point.
13,5,">This is pretty clear cut and I'm not sure what to get out of it. I’m just curious about the legality of This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask"
18,13,"I wear a mask in a race. I have seen them on a lot of people, not just in college. I've tried a mask in the university, but I can't see that the mask makes the difference."
22,13,"That's just the most important part of the vaccine, but it's very simple. A mask helps fight the spread of the disease."
37,13,Isn't it the fact that you have to wear a mask while you are in the hospital? Because that's a bad idea.
44,13,I'm sure it would be funny to hear you have a mask because a woman whose body is covered in a red blood cell is causing it's own death.
45,13,"It's not funny, but it's a terrible joke. It's not funny."
47,13,"This is what a lot of people feel, in real life. It's not a joke or a joke but something else."
59,13,"I read that it said ""But we're in the process of trying to get things done and the CDC is trying to bring people to safety and to make sure we don't get vaccinated."""
61,13,"My husband, who is also in the US, said that wearing a mask was ""like a joke that you're not going to get a vaccine."""
72,13,That's a fucking shady way to look at it.
73,13,The whole thing is in no way a political statement.
83,13,"IANAL, but I’ve had my eyes open on a couple of things and I can tell you why."
86,13,"I think the NSA's instigating the movement, which is also blatantly stating that they're going to end this fight by removing these masks from the airspace, is a bit misleading."
13,5,This is all kind of a joke.
18,13,Isn't the mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
22,13,That's one of the reasons that he has to stop wearing it. He has to stop being in a fight with people who would like to get out of it. He is an idiot and I can't stand him in this.
37,13,"Yes, it's a bad idea. Vaccination and masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
44,13,"The NSA does not provide vaccinations, so you have a legitimate argument to do that."
45,13,ah no. i would not wear a mask outside.
47,13,"I am so sorry, I don't know what you are talking about."

I can't help you, because if you're going to be with a girl with a slob on the front I'm going to be afraid of being eaten on the back of the car and a slob in my face."
72,13,"I feel like I'm in a pretty good place at the moment. I'm a scummy asshole but I'm not really interested in being able to put on my mask in a public place, but I think I should give it a try. But I know people who do. If I think it's shady to say that, I'm going to go get a tampon."

13,5,"What's the point of the CDC saying they're not going to get vaccinations without first contacting the CDC, and that they have no obligation to do so?"

37,13,I would love to hear how the CDC and NIH are not going to protect a child from HIV and it is a great idea. They are going to want a mask of a vaccine that stops the spread of a virus. That's all.
44,13,I'm sorry this is coming off as cynical and racist. The government and their administration are going to need to work together on the next step.
45,13,There is no joke. You don't have to put up with it. You put up with it.
47,13,This is an example of a bit of a prank that gets more attention than the reality of something you can't really tell me.
59,13,Vaccination is not a part of the health care system.

72,13,">He's not going to change, he’s going to get a new hat, and be honest with his wife about the situation with his new hat. Is it really that easy to see the mask in action in movies and movies?"
73,13,">You know, what a joke. I read this and it makes sense. I'm not a fan of the government, but I think the problem isn't that it's not helping, but that it's just not the same as the disease. Apparently, the CDC has been doing the same thing with the HIV and THC treatment."
83,13,"This is a lot more of a political issue, but I can see why people are not interested in what's happening and why the public isn't interested in what is happening."
86,13,I want to go back to bed now.
13,5,>The only way I get the slob in my face is if I eat the cigarette. It's not my job to help.
18,13,I'm not sure you have any good point in the OP.
22,13,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated. Wearing a mask while being vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,13,"A good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past."
44,13,"If the government actually wants to stop the spread of a virus, then it should be possible for you to help. This is one of the major problems with government."
45,13,"I think the joke about wearing a mask is just as terrible as saying ""I'm not a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean."""
47,13,The CDC is doing something different with masks.
59,13,I'm not sure what that means. Vaccination is not a part of the health care system. The CDC has the right to say something that isn't ok. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird.
61,13,The NSA is helping to stop the spread of HIV. I think most people are confused and confused as to why people wear a mask and then the NSA says:
72,13,">Pety's not going to change, he’s going to get a new hat, and be honest with his wife about the situation with his new hat. Is it really that easy to see the mask in action in movies and movies?"""
73,13,"They're all telling you that if it's not effective against HIV, that it's a joke."
83,13,I'm not sure the context for your comment is right. Getting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,13,"Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. It is useless and I hate it. I want to say, 'You know what they're saying, I can't help but feel like you're telling me what I know, I think it is just telling the truth."
13,5,"It's a joke, and the CIA is making the case that we're trying to stop the spread of HIV, despite the fact that there's no way to tell us if someone should or shouldn't be on the list."
18,13,>I'm trying to tell him that I have no problem wearing a mask. I'm just saying it's really a good idea. I'm just saying it's really a good idea. I'm just saying it's really a good idea.
22,13,The point of this article is to suggest that people aren't necessarily immune to any form of health risks. The article is not about that.
37,13,"In a different story, the doctor who wore the mask blew it out of proportion."
44,13,I grew up in an AZ area and they are really crappy on the CIA and the government
45,13,He has already sworn out that the government has no right to prescribe his own forms of marmalade or any type of protective garment.
47,13,They don't have the power to stop the spread of the virus. They have to do what it takes to stop it.
59,13,And now we know how to make a mask so you can not smell a virus or any other stuff while he's wearing a mask.
61,13,I don't know what it is but a bit of a joke.
72,13,"It’s a bit much, because we already have a lot of people who are getting scared and it’s just not right to tell them, but if they don’t know, they don’t know what they’re doing, and they don’t know."
73,13,I don't think they're being a fool.
83,13,> Getting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,13,"I don't think that's a legitimate reason to wear a mask, nor is it an inadequacy of the term to make it ""stupid"". It's simply a way of avoiding the risk of a virus from being spread, so the NSA isn't able to stop the spread of the virus."
