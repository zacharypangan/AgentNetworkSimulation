45,25,There is a difference between a mask and a glove.
47,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,25,"I don't think that wearing a mask is useful, if there's an outbreak of colitis, then it's a useful tool. I'm not sure you can do this for your kids unless you use a mask."
64,25,I like wearing my mask when I'm not wearing it.

85,25,"I would have had a problem with this, it's a sad problem with our society, and it's not my thing."

101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,This is a great gif. It's a perfect way to help people know you need help.
45,25,"I've got a hand lubricated one and I have to wear it after I am done vaccinating people in public. It's a great thing, but a hand lubricated one is not going to protect other people."
47,25,I think this is in the context of people getting sick of being outed for being outside of their jobs. I think it's a bit different now. But maybe some people need a little help getting better.
56,25,>I'm really looking forward to seeing a copy of that book and the whole 'I wish you were wearing a mask' concept in the future.
64,25,"What does ""empathy"" mean to you? I am a racist and I genuinely enjoy wearing my mask when I'm not wearing it. I am just trying to be more open to people."
67,25,"I was wondering if the CDC would be willing to put you in the same situation, but I didn't have the time to check, since it's been an issue for years."
85,25,"The vebb has a lot of problems with its behaviour. My vebbbb is a big problem, and I've been around it, but I'm also sick of the stuff she's on, and sometimes even the lack of one."
91,25,i play paintball and the play in the store is a bit difficult to hold
99,25,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,I think the CDC would be willing to put you in the same situation.
45,25,"You do not have the right to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving if you don't want to. You can wear a hand lubricated one outdoors while vaccinating a person outside and a mask in a crate. You can wear a hand lubricated one in public as well, but it doesn't have to protect other people when they do a mask."
47,25,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
56,25,"CANNOTANSWER: I want to have a child that is not infected with a disease like colitis. I'm afraid it would eat them in the end, because when I don't do it I get the sick t-shirt, the socks, and a thong."
64,25,"Is this how people - who use the word ""empathy"" - express themselves?"
67,25,The reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated.
85,25,"If you're trying to take the time to educate someone on this, I think it would be great to be able to help. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
91,25,"And the thing is that the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to use a face mask."
99,25,I have a feeling that if I don't wear a mask every single day I don't have a reason to wear one.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,"I'm the CDC, I'm just not saying that fuck 'em.' But this is the only thing I can say that's true, since I'm a racist, and I don't really think that I would be able to wear one. I mean, I'm a very good person, but I'm able to wear my own mask as well. I do not want to be a racist. I'd like to be a superhero in my own world."
45,25,The whole idea of wearing a mask outside on Thanksgiving is just stupid. I don't see how it can hurt other people's health.
47,25,"People aren't saboteurs. It's like saying a doctor could not tell you something, or a doctor could tell you that the doctor doesn't know if you're a patient and you're not a physician."
56,25,"I'd like to know where the next time there's an outbreak, if you're not sure I'm going to get sick or die. I'm sure it would help if you weren't vaccinated."
64,25,No it isn't. I'm a big fan of that mask.
67,25,You can wear a mask in an emergency. But it is not the only way to keep yourself safe.
85,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,25,"I'm not getting any of the advice but I think a lot of the op used to be like this - people with a mask can't just say ""well it's only because you're wearing a mask."" Hence the title, you're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it."
99,25,The mask is probably only supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus. Its not going to work.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,"I'm a huge fan of a mask, I think it's very cool how you can wear your own mask and not get a sick person if they want. I'm trying to find a place that has some of the same kind of protections."
45,25,"In the US, everyone is allowed to wear a mask, including the kids in a crate, while vaccinating, and for vaccination."
47,25,>I think this is in the context of people getting sick of being outed for being outside of their jobs. I think it's a bit different now. But maybe some people need a little help getting better.'
56,25,"Vaccination isn't the only vaccine available, it's a bad idea."
64,25,I'm going to go to a doctor if I ever have to wear a mask. That way they don't actually get sick.
67,25,What do you mean by a joke? Apparently the guy who said it was a joke didn't mean to. Unless they wanted to go to the school and they said the guy did. And they got the CDC to do it anyway.
85,25,This is why I'm so stoked for the guy that is still working for the government and is resentful about it.
91,25,"You're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it. I'm a big fan of the NSA's use of it."
99,25,People who don't know about Santa have told us that the CDC can help prevent this.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,"Then you want a Vaccine for those who need it, and that's all."
45,25,">[[I think it's time to move on. It's about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines. I'm sorry if I sounded too harsh but this is a great one. Hopefully, people don't have to go through with the vaccines on Thanksgiving and get over the fact that their doctors are using vaccines to stop the spread of the virus."
47,25,>I've never read a single piece of written literature where people can't be bothered to wear a mask. There is a government funded program that would stop people from wearing a mask.
56,25,It doesn't address the issue that's spreading. It's a huge question.
64,25,"I was a little bit of a snob in the health care arena, so I wasn't entirely surprised to find that the people who do wear masks don't actually get sick."
67,25,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
85,25,I've lived with a dog my entire life and this is why I'm happy to wear a mask.
91,25,"I've been in this op game a few times, and it sounds like a funny joke."
99,25,"The movie, and the movie. All I can think of is the fact that if you're just going to wear a mask all the time, you don't really need to remember anything about it."
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
45,25,"I'm not sure if there's a wikipedia article, but this is basically what the government does in America besides being the only medical tool promoting vaccine use."
47,25,I don't understand why people are being offended by the idea that people are being offended by wearing masks. I do believe that putting on a mask would be a huge help to prevent the spread of a virus.
56,25,"There are lots of good ways to stop people getting sick, but not the whole ""it's a good idea,"" thing."
64,25,I think it's funny that the one person who wears a mask is a black woman.
67,25,I feel like this is the most inappropriate joke I've heard about the government.
85,25,"I wouldn't be happy without a mask. That's a bad idea, though."
91,25,It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent.
99,25,I think that you should see a doctor who wears a mask for Christmas as a means of stopping the spread of the virus.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,I think it's not as bad as what we think is happening in the CIA or the NSA.
45,25,People who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion.
47,25,">but in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
56,25,I have colitis and i would be a little spry if my husband and I had to wear a mask on my birthday but this is something people would ask me for information on.
64,25,"It seems to me that, given how I've lived my whole life, this isn't a joke. I like the idea that, as long as the government doesn't act like a troll he'll probably get his act together."
67,25,"It's not a joke, I mean he made a joke about wearing a mask in a bad way. He didn't say anything to me and it's funny and I just don't like the idea of him making a joke. It's a joke, not a joke."
85,25,"idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."
91,25,He's a little too young to be on the internet. It's the internet he's on.
99,25,I think you need to go to the doctor. I do wear a mask and a mask on Christmas.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,The CDC cites the CDC to be the only medical tool to promote vaccine use. They will be implementing it in many places if they get a chance.
45,25,"No, it's not. A mask does protect other people and is not a good idea. It can be done anywhere, for no reason at all, and at any time, and can't stop a viral disease."
47,25,Well it would have to be a very short article.
56,25,>We should definitely wear one on my plane. It's a joke.
64,25,...and what if I wear a mask in a python costume and wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you haven't had a problem with wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you want to be protected from a virus. Wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you haven't had a problem with wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you want to be protected from a virus.
67,25,"It's a joke, not a joke. In the US, it's a joke."
85,25,What is a mask? A mask is something that has a good moral effect.
91,25,"A lot of people here are so young, i'd like to know why these things are happening."
99,25,"... But, yes, the CDC will probably want to see some sort of prevention campaign on how they are going to stop the spread of the virus."
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,It's not really a joke. It's a joke.
45,25,"Vaccination is a good idea, but it also provides protection for sick people who are not in a danger zone. This is also why it's not a joke."
47,25,I don't think you are offended. The CDC is doing nothing to keep people from getting sick.
56,25,">I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus."" Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus. Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus."
64,25,It's just a joke.
67,25,"It's a joke, not a joke. Vaccination is a right."
85,25,What's the worst thing that could happen to a dog? We would be fucked.
91,25,"I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. People who don't know what a python is, so I feel that I am not getting into I think it is a really weird thing to do."
99,25,>I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
