77,10,I can see it happening. The question is why don't you tell me what to do next if there isn't a person you care about but care about what others think you can and can't do besides play a card game and get a bunch of jokes if it was you.

We have been going for 6 years and it was really nice to be outside but he's already a bit uninvolved, he's probably been wearing it for about 2 weeks now. It's not fun, but it's a really cool idea - so I figured it was good to come out and we can go into business together"

16,10,I think the wording on the film is pretty misleading. I'm not sure how he's going to get the AIDS/AIDS virus a long time after the movie came out. I would like to know how to wear a mask. A great way to show that we love our neighbors so they have enough compassion for our friends to do so.

I've seen a few jokes that go like this: ""I'm a doctor, I have an exam tomorrow, and I'm sure I can get a full vaccine. I do this. I'm the one who gets infected. I do that in public every day. I'm not allowed to get a full vaccination. """
59,10,"Are you still wearing a mask? Why would someone who lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official? There's this weird ""I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick"" syndrome."
77,10,I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that.
80,10,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's so creepy for people like me to be such an extreme dick. What a nice guy he is.
84,10,It's really a shame they took you to a drive up test. The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues.
87,10,People with HIV in the US are often the poorest people on the planet because they can't speak English well.

10,2,You're only going to need one if you're a professional HIV/AIDS patient.
10,4,> I'm a doctor
15,10,I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.

I don't understand why people don't wear a mask."
17,10,[It seems like one of the most effective ways to protect your child from the virus is to wear a mask. Wearing a mask at work does something to prevent the spread of a virus. I am a little bit of a python nerd and wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus. I have found that they are the best method of preventing it because I know people who haven't tried it yet and have a feeling that a virus is spreading.
18,10,I think a good way to look at this is to ask a question. Are you in a position where you need to be able to talk to people while you are on a run to get your head under control? I don't know.
28,10,"Well, I'm not sure that you really believe me."
32,10,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,10,>I don't like to wear a mask and bend over to prevent someone else from putting on a mask.
44,10,"I don't think you're right. ""Suicide is a great way to prevent it"" is one of the most common ways to prevent it."
45,10,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
54,10,It's an interesting fact that I have a lot of respect for the president of my country because he is very much a troll. Especially the ones that are in the position to go after him with the same excuse.
59,10,"You’re not going to get sick, you are going to make a bad choice in your life and go crazy. What’s the point of getting vaccinated in the first place?"

87,10,You're being downvoted to hell because you're not being helpful. You have to be respectful of your privacy.
88,10,I feel like if I had a fat lip in I'd probably be the only one who could wear a mask in public.
90,10,It's hard for me to say I haven't seen any of this stuff.
91,10,...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!

97,10,"This is one of those words that you are told that it doesn't work without your mask on, which is why you wear a mask. It's a pretty good way to prevent a virus from spreading."
10,2,I read a report that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one.

37,10,"I am a medical professional. It sounds like I'm just trying to be very honest about this - I was just wondering if you know what I mean by that. I gotta be real! I am not a lawyer, but I can help you. It sounds like you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not. This is not a government-funded initiative, it is part of the government-funded initiative. It's more like a federal health care system, or a state based one."
44,10,> The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
45,10,Assuming the comments in this thread are really true. I think it's time to move on.
54,10,"My favorite one is 'You're wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In the U.S., wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
59,10,"It seems like they can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
77,10,Using the word 'I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks.'
80,10,I was thinking the same thing. A lot of people have been to that kind of medical emergency where they don't get a medical mask or even a medical device but aren't very familiar with the disease. And it is very common for people to come into the hospital without a mask or anything like that to keep their immune systems protected.
84,10,"> ""This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."

90,10,"I'm gonna say, I don't like this."
91,10,"I'm so glad the NSA is putting more effort into fighting the government and is threatening to retaliate against people who don't get to help prevent the virus.

28,10,"I have never done anything that has to do with the disease being diagnosed. Whether that was in a patient or not, the disease itself is something I don't think that is a problem."
32,10,The guy on that page who's wearing the mask is a shit doctor.
37,10,"What's going on here is not to mention how sick the country is, it is to prevent the spread of disease, and to try to prevent other people from doing it."
44,10,What does the doctor know about the problem?

54,10,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,10,"It's a big deal that the CDC doesn't have the mandate to have vaccines in all of the developed nations. That's a huge problem, and a very big problem."
77,10,"I don't think the idea of wearing a mask is a bad idea, just weird, like the way pranksters say, “Hey I think that's very cool if you think you're a pretty clever guy.”"
80,10,I think he would have been able to get a mask and a life jacket from the hospital.
84,10,I'm a cynic and my husband is not a lawyer.
87,10,I know that the point of a rant is to tell you to keep it on. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,10,I'm really just gonna throw in some information on the other side of the argument...
90,10,"I don't know where this guy was from, but I think you're describing the kind of people who are trying to arouse the public. It's not that much fun to do that, but I also don't think it's smart to try to convince them to do it when they can't do it without having to ask for a handshake or something."
91,10,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn’t interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.

17,10,"I grew up with a very sick friend who thought this was a joke, and this is a common joke amongst children."
18,10,"I don't know, just that I wear a mask when I'm in a run."
28,10,A little bit of the same thing happened to me once when i had to stop being vaccinated. I thought it was an amazing opportunity to show how the government is fucking the people out.
32,10,"What's your job? I'm sorry but I can't do this. If it isn't yours then you can't do it. The only way to prevent a virus outbreak is to help your husband. You can't do this, and you'll have to have to put up with it. But I think the fact that he doesn't like it on Thanksgiving is a real issue."
37,10,I'm really sorry but that's not my situation. Having a bad day isn't a bad thing and I really feel like I have to go to the doctor.
44,10,"The government is not an authority. It's a snazzy meme based on a slapstick meme that the government has a right to make people wear masks. You need to change your mask to one that is on a table, with a mirror on it. What is the problem with this?"

80,10,"I was also told the same thing about my friend who has a virus. I've never seen one. It was a joke about a man who had a'sitting down', then he put his face on the face of someone else's doctor, then a 'walking on the street', then a ""waiting for me"" for him to show up with his face on the floor when someone was in his room."
84,10,I'm sorry to say that you've been overreacting and I hope you don't feel a lot of pain.

10,4,Is it in any way necessary to get your life back on track?
15,10,"Is it the fact that people are being manipulated? It's not a joke to me, and it's not really a joke to me."

28,10,I didn't read the article. It was written to inform the population that I wasn't in an active state and I don't care for the government. It doesn't seem like the government cares about it.
32,10,"I'm gonna say, I don't like this. he said he wanted to wear a mask because it was a way to hide his fear."
37,10,"It was a joke! I love it. It’s so easy to have it wrong, but it doesn’t help at all. The only reason I ever do that is to protect my family and get them to wear a mask. It has no idea what it means or what it means or what the government wants them to do. I just don’t care about what the public is seeing and what the government needs for that. It’s more important than knowing someone’s place of existence. I just don’t like it. I’m sure he doesn’t want to give him the benefit"
44,10,"The NSA is the official authority on vaccinations in the United States. It's a joke if you're sick of it, but its not a good idea."
45,10,"I don't know if it's actually just a joke, but I would say ""I'm pretty sure they have something to do with it"" rather than ""I don't have a right to be offended,"" because I don't like it."
54,10,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll. I don’t like the idea of being a politician."
59,10,"It's a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
77,10,People with masks wear them because they want to be in the public eye and they don't want to be seen. The only way to get it off is if they see it coming and the prankster is lying.
80,10,"I'd bet that you don't have a phobia. But then again, I don't understand how people get this way with a phobia. There's a good chance that the idea would be funny, and I think that's part of the point of the joke."
84,10,i don't think this makes sense. I just think it seems like a really bad joke to me.
87,10,"Yes, a lot of people are still using a mask. If you don't have an adult that will be able to vaccinate you, then the mask is your best shot."
88,10,"I wear a mask for protection when I do this, and it makes me more comfortable. It's the way to help you."
90,10,I think they have to be kidding themselves. It was just a joke.
91,10,>(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
96,10,So you wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please
97,10,"It is the idiomatic part, but the point here is that the government is a tyrant. This means that you must put up with the sexist jokes that they give you."
10,2,"He had to leave because the government is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS, he needs to move on to a different job."
10,4,So this NSA agent says something sexist about the CDC.
15,10,"A person isn't a prankster, he's a politician who believes that 'the government needs to stop'."
16,10,"I don't know where I'm getting the idea that this is a sarcastic premise. You say this because it's funny? I mean, it's funny, but it makes me cringe and think it's actually funny. This is what it is."
17,10,I don't think it's a good joke. It seems like you're trying to be clever.
18,10,"It's like you could run around with a camera on your head and say oh ""Make a prank, I'm not gonna do that."" But you are in the minority. If you are a prankster, I am sure you know what you mean. I'm sure you don't. I'm not that conservative. Is that just a joke?"
28,10,"[Hey, I just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route I am in orlando and would love to come with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance."
32,10,"A lot of what people are going to say about wearing a mask is what they are trying to say. It is also illegal for people to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The government, not the people, is allowed to have it on and not use it. So it is a good idea, but it is not what they intended to be. I'm not a doctor."
37,10,That's hilarious. I've heard this one before:
44,10,I don't think he's really into that.
45,10,">I think people are overreacting. It is legal in the US, where doctors have no rights to prescribe them and therefore they are allowed to wear any form of mask they wish to be prescribed."
54,10,"I just read this last week in a book about a person who goes to work to keep a mask. I've never read that book. It makes me very, very uncomfortable."
59,10,"I'm a doctor. The CDC is responsible for the costs of vaccines, and so is any federally mandated government. So they need to be made a part of their funding policy."
77,10,Is it possible that they will wear a hoodie or some other costume that actually does the work? Is there a way they can put a hoodie on when the people they want to be in the public eye aren't being aware of what a python is?
80,10,I think a lot of people who have a phobia feel a lot more secure when they are in contact with the virus. It's not a joke.
84,10,"Despite the NSA's threats, it doesn't appear to be working."
87,10,"""I'm not afraid to be a doctor. I don't think it's a big deal. I'm sorry if I came across that way, but if you had a great laugh, I would've remarked. I'm not shy? That is your problem."""
88,10,"I don't see how you can rely on that. This is about keeping the health of your body intact, especially the vaccinated."
90,10,"i like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me"
91,10,"The whole idea of doing this in a public environment that is not safe is a little strange. It's not even the NSA, so he's not an asshole. He was a fool."
96,10,wearing a mask and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend
97,10,"So what do you mean ""I want to wear a mask and the sexist jokes that they give me?"""
10,2,It is a joke.... not a prank.
10,4,"Having a hoodie on and saying ""Make a prank, I'm not gonna do that"" is a pretty bad idea. It's not funny because it's on your head - it's just a prank. It's not that it's funny because it's funny because people who can't make a joke about it and whatnot aren't going to listen to it - or at least not see it as a joke."
15,10,A prankster and a politician at the same time.
16,10,I believe it's funny and just that it's part of the government's mission to stop the spread of the AIDS/AIDS virus.
17,10,This is a joke. This is an asshole joke.
18,10,I think people who are like this aren't being naive or in a funny way at all.
28,10,It sounds like a symptom of the disease being diagnosed and being vaccinated by the CDC. And it is a joke.
32,10,"I don't really think this is a prank, it's a joke."
37,10,"I'm sorry, but I've heard this one before: ""I think you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not."
44,10,"This sounds like a lot of work to you. I am not going to lie here, I'm not going to write an entire novel about the government. It's a really long piece of work to do, I think."
45,10,"I'm not a fan of the jokes, but I think it's time to move on."
54,10,Vaccinations are not the way to stop the spread of a virus.
59,10,The government has already spent a lot of money on the NSA and its hat. They are doing this for fear of the public health disasters. I think I understand what you are saying a bit but isn't a medical scientist?
77,10,"I think that there are a lot of different versions of ""Potentially evil in a group, a person who loves to fuck people with a python, will be sick, and would never be able to go to a hospital and be infected."""
80,10,It's a joke.
84,10,"I feel for you, though."
87,10,"I’m so sorry to say this, but I think this is the worst part of the whole thing. I hate putting my face in the mirror because of it."
88,10,I feel like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning.
90,10,"I'm a prankster, and I slapped a slapstick prank on myself after a prank, but I've learned that I'm probably not on the best of habits. This might be the same thing with people running around in disguise (for example, if I'm running in the bathroom or something)."
91,10,"A lot of people here are so young, i'd like to know why these things are happening....I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible ""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to disenfranchise people....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."", ""But the worst part of this is..."
96,10,"When you get a good, clean or clean and have a full set of masks, you can't just wear one over the whole thing."
97,10,"So you're saying that when you're on the street and you're thinking ""Well, I don't know why people wear a mask. But I think I'm going to go on and on and on and on. I just want to be on my knees and say I want to go on and on and on."""
