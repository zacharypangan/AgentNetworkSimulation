93,17,"I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I've always felt like people were giving me a reason to wear it, and for the same reason, I am more worried about getting infected by things that's less terrifying."

93,33,"if we could have had a real, real, real, real person at the centre of the universe with the eyes closed, there would be plenty of excuses for people to be frightened by the spread of viruses that are very common in our daily lives"
93,36,"Twas a very good point about the whole people being out there, and there was a great example of that. I don t think people are oblivious to this, but the people in the US have a long history of wearing masks. So it makes sense, but I think it ruins the entire concept."
93,38,I would say that's a good point.
93,39,I 'd be happy to put you through with that...
93,43,It's not easy to put yourself at risk and get sick.
93,44,They are so big on this one that they could do anything to try and get the word out there for them.
93,48,i would have put on a mask on a run
93,49,"I like to wear a mask when I run, and I don t think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day."
93,53,And the mask on the run is an important part of preventing spread of disease - removing the virus. It focuses on a certain group of people that can help them by preventing the spread of the disease and then helping them avoid the virus.

93,92,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
99,93,I think that's a good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
93,4,"I want to know if people have any idea how much this is going to change in the future and if that happens, if you aren't trying, then it could go over with just being aware of how much more people are coming into our society and how much is going to be put out of their hands. I would give myself that kind of a reason."

I've always felt like people were giving me a reason to wear it, and for the same reason, I am more worried about getting infected by things that's less terrifying."
93,7,A good analogy would be to wear a mask and then throw a small piece of plastic in the trash... because that's what keeps the public frightened and I think you're right that it's a good idea.
93,8,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,11,Sadly we have not had enough to eat as of late and it's been very painfully traumatic. This is not true. This is a good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
93,12,We can be all the 'terrorists' and we can't stop the spread of viruses and get better. We're all just going to be there for you.
93,15,"I think that if the US had a long history of wearing masks, that people would have no problem at all having people like this."
93,16,"If you put yourself at risk for some kind of disease, you have a good chance of getting a virus."
93,17,"I was also terrified of the people that tried to spread this virus through the media, but I didn't care if they could actually help anyone. So I swore to wear a mask on a run instead because the government was very concerned about spreading the virus."
93,18,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,28,"They also say that it's really hard to stop a virus if you don't wear a mask. So I guess that's kind of the end of the story, because I don't want to go in the first place."
93,30,My dad is a person who's always been the worst in the community. I am so jealous.
93,33,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,36,I like that it's the same type of person in the media who wears a mask all the time in the community.
93,38,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to help people with the same symptoms? How do you want to make people care?
93,39,"I think there's a lot of great analogies here. The way you see it, the fact that a person is not likely to ever get a real virus or have the disease is a big part of the reason people like wearing them. The fact that the government gives people a reason to wear them and that is probably why the government didn't use them."
93,43,I'm a bit jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community.

93,53,Wearing a mask on the run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,58,That's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
93,64,"I love the fact that the government is willing to help protect people from diseases and make people better. It's an unfortunate situation that does not happen with us. And I've been there many times, too. It's not like people in the media can't help. They have no idea how people are willing to help others and then you can't even put their face in the public eye to get sick. It's a myth that 'putting yourself at risk' is a joke that was meant to 'fix' it."
93,68,The underlying idea that people are infected by the virus is based on the fact that a man is infected with the virus.
93,76,"It's not really that complicated in a sense. It's really a simple way of saying, ""But I don't really want you to know I wear a mask for running or I'm going to be frightened."" I've always wondered whether this is the same as it was in the article."
93,81,Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,92,"he said ""[i like] wearing a mask on a run I like to wear a mask when I run, and I don't think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day."""
99,93,"Yeah, it's a'mistake'."
93,4,> Putting myself at risk.
93,5,"A friend of mine was infected with a virus and his father tried to take care of him. So when he asked him to help, he essentially said, ""Wow, I got a virus from my mother!""."
93,6,"It's not just a joke, it's a way of saying, ""I don't really want you to know I wear a mask for running or I'm going to be frightened."" Yeah, it's a mistake."
93,7,A good analogy would be to wear a mask and then throw a small piece of plastic in the trash... because that's what keeps the public frightened and I think you're right that it's a good idea.
93,8,This is just one of the many things that Americans tend to look for in things like this:
93,11,"It is pretty clear the government did not try to stop the spread of the virus. They supposedly tried to prevent it by eliminating the use of a mask, but they decided to allow the other people to use a mask."
93,12,I'm so glad you think that a a person would have thought it was necessary to wear a mask. That is really just the best part of living with them.
93,15,"Wearing a mask to run, i wore a mask when i ran and i thought, hey, i like the idea of going to the doctor."
93,16,There's a funny thing I learned from this story in a scavenger hunt.
93,17,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They also say that it's really hard to stop a virus if you don't wear a mask. So I guess that's kind of the end of the story, because I don't want to go in the first place."
93,18,...I wear a mask all the time on a run. It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to make people care?
93,28,"So, you're not gonna help your sister, or your dad a lot in the community."
93,30,I've always wondered whether this is the same as it was in the article. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,33,"The government gives people a reason to wear them because it doesn't help protect themselves, and it does it because it keeps people from worrying. And if they can't stop it, that's because they can't."
93,36,ahhh that makes sense. I thought it was kind of a silly joke
93,38,"[NAME] [NAME]: You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
93,39,It's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
93,43,"The most important question to answer is: ""Why do you think you can't tell the difference between running a faceless mask on a run, and wearing a mask on a run?"""
93,44,> There are many people in the world who have put themselves at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from?
93,48,"if you are a man with a shit head a guy might say something like ""i'm not a troll and you're not a troll"". he is a guy with a shit head but isn't a troll, he is a troll."
93,49,I think it's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
93,53,"I mean, the guy that said ""I like"" wearing a mask on a run."
93,58,There's more to it than that.
93,64,That's an interesting perspective on how people are influenced by a lot of things - such as what happens when we are sick - but not as much as everyone else in the community.
93,68,"If I wanted a joke on a joke I'd just say,"
93,76,I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country. It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk.
93,81,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,92,"I was just reading the article and the implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
99,93,"I hate to say it, but this is why I don't wear a mask every day. I love it!"
93,4,"I am sorry, I am a bit off on what I was going to do, but the whole point of this article is that I think you are being a dick here. It's an interesting analogy."
93,5,"I think it's funny because it isn't a joke, but it does say that the government will aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,6,Definitely a funny joke.
93,7,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from?
93,8,"I think there's a lot of things Americans tend to look for in things like this.

It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,12,"I always thought it was kind of a silly joke, like, ""If I were you, I would have seen a whole world of other people wearing a mask. ""... I wear a mask on the run to protect myself, even though my mask might help you."""
93,15,The joke 'Wip a mask on a run to protect yourself if you don't'is a kind of a joke if you don't want to wear it '. I don't think it's wrong for people to wear masks and it's actually quite common for people to wear them. I've always wondered if this is the same as the joke in the article.
93,16,And we could also find out why a troll would run a mask when it flies.
93,17,This is not what a joke is. I thought it was kind of a silly joke.
93,18,"The implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
93,28,I think you're trying to be too dramatic here.
93,30,People do not wear a mask on a run unless they are really concerned about something else. You have no idea how to actually protect yourself without a mask in your face.
93,33,OP is a narcissist.
93,36,"You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
93,38,People who don't get a mask if they get a fad are very likely to be infected with the virus. It's probably not a joke but it makes sense to be around people who don't like it.
93,39,The article is about wearing a mask and the government is providing people with information to help protect themselves. This seems to be the biggest joke in the entire wiki article.
93,43,This joke is one of those that comes off as very clever:
93,44,I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I don't want to go in the first place.
93,48,I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff.
93,49,You are a troll. You are not a troll. It is a joke. It is not your fault the government is helping a virus. It's you who is trying to stop it. This is a joke that is in the cliche category of being a troll.
93,53,"I don't think the government has anything to do with this, I just think it's an interesting perspective on how people are influenced by a lot of things. I'm not a big fan of the government, but I do like the idea that we can stop the spread of a virus."
93,58,I'm going to throw a funny joke in the mud: You shouldn't wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus.
93,64,"I don't care what you say. The joke you're thinking of is really clever, but that's why you're not wearing a mask."
93,68,"Nope, it's really funny. I'm a nerd but I'm more of a person who wears a mask a lot because of this. I like the way you do it."
93,76,"You're absolutely right. The guy with a shit head would say something like ""i'm not a troll and you're not a troll""."
93,81,"I always thought it was a silly joke... i think it made sense, but it does make sense."
93,92,Exactly! The government should have a place to do whatever it is they can to protect themselves.
99,93,"It doesn't stop the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
93,4,I'd tell him to wear a mask for a long time and be patient with him. The only problem is he doesn't listen to what he wants to say.
93,5,[Kids] (http://www.kids.com/) :-) OP:
93,6,The wiki article is about the use of a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
93,7,"Why do people like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
93,8,You're a troll.
93,11,"That's a funny way of putting it. This is a joke that is so infuriating that it's going to end with a ""to be ashamed of myself"" type joke."
93,12,"There is a reason we don't need a mask, they want to protect themselves from viruses."
93,15,"What is it? A mask, a mask, and a tan mask? A tan mask? What's it like wearing a mask?"
93,16,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is not what a joke is.
93,17,"I'm a little jealous of the people that tried to spread this virus through the media, but I didn't care if they could actually help anyone. So I swore to wear a mask on a run instead because the government was very concerned about spreading the virus. I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff."
93,18,"I mean, when I've ever seen an actual person wearing a mask on the run, I really have to know how to actually stop it."
93,28,This is an interesting point I'm making in this thread.
93,30,"'My dad is a person who's always been the worst in the community. I am so jealous."""
93,33,I don't think that's what it is.
93,36,"In all fairness, this a joke, but it's a joke, and it makes sense."
93,38,"If the government is not using the crazies of the wiki article, I'd not say it's a joke, because I can't think of a single reason it makes a joke."
93,39,The joke isn't the joke. It's the real joke.
93,43,"You're going to throw a funny joke in the mud: You shouldn't wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't care what you say. The joke you're thinking of is really clever, but that's why you're not wearing a mask. Nope, it's really funny."
93,44,> It's really funny. I'm a nerd but I'm more of a person who wears a mask a lot because of this.
93,48,"OP is trying to be a troll. This is a funny joke that comes off as very clever, but I like the way you do it."
93,49,"If a shit head was telling me to go to a run and get my face shattered by a virus and I went to a gym, I would do so because that's a good way to avoid shit head!"
93,53,"Using that quote in an article was not a joke, rather it was a part of the article. It is a joke. This is not what a joke is."
93,58,A lot of people are going to tell you that a mask is a joke and you don't want to wear it.
93,64,I'm sorry if I have to use a troll phrase:
93,68,[(https://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous-Facial-Relationships/The-Infectious_Violence-Virus) is part of the article's title.
93,76,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This seems to be the biggest joke in the entire wiki article.
93,81,> 'Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
