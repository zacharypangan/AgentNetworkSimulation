60,15,I'm not going to lie: a virus can not cause an infection. I'm afraid that some kind of narcissists who doesn't understand the importance of wearing a mask can.
60,18,I was told a friend of mine had a bad case of cancer on a doctor's check-up at work and it would be much more important to have him wear a mask and bend over in a hospital than it is to wear a mask and bend over.
60,20,"I read this as a person who could wear a mask if he didn't have a mask on. I thought he was saying people should wear a mask, to prevent the spread of a virus, so he said ""We should wear a mask"""

60,29,"It doesn't look like an innate ability to care for an infection, just a need to do a job that is in a tight setting. You can wear a mask, and no matter what you want, the way you want it to be is in a tight setting. A mask that's actually not a mask will not prevent a disease. It's a way to help protect you against a disease. It's all part of a health care system, you can choose the kind of mask that you can wear. There is a lot of them in public,"

70,60,It's funny you say that but he's trying to stop the spread of a virus.
83,60,Isn't this part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus?
86,60,I think that it's very easy to stop the spread of the virus and still think about it. This whole 'why doesn't anyone wear a mask' thing is very very insidious and ignorant.

60,18,"There are very good reasons to not wear a mask. I'm not the biggest fan, but I don't think it is a joke."
60,20,"I don't think it's anything special to wear a mask while sick, just the way you say it."
60,27,They aren't really the best Vaccine Vaccination product. They're used by an organization that has trained a lot of people for a long time.
60,29,"They're in the US gov't but it's not in any way necessary for people to put on a mask. People can wear any sort of mask. And you can wear any kind of mask you want. You can wear whatever mask you want, so I can be pretty sure people who don't wear a mask will not think of it as a 'failure' unless they are vaccinated."
60,32,"It's probably better to wear a mask and bend over, but wear the mask and bend over"
60,34,I can't wear a mask on a day. It feels like a huge deal.
60,45,"This is a joke, not a meme."
62,60,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If you're on the subject of how it affects you, it may be more appropriate to say this: Yes."
63,60,i'm in the midst of a new medical crisis and the government isn't putting up with the fact that everyone is in the first place.

83,60,"You are not a doctor, you are a physician."
86,60,I firmly believe in removing cloaks from the airspace and instigating the spread of a virus. I think that's a great idea if the government could pull it off. The NSA can do more with this shit than just removing masks from the airspace and instigating a blood smear wave.
87,60,Are you gonna get up and say something like this when you get up? It is the right thing to do unless you're not in the minority.

60,18,I'm a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear masks in the midst of a disease.
60,20,Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when you're not in the flu.
60,27,"I'm a Doctor. The Doctor knows I'm a Doctor and has an issue with it. The Doctor will tell you that you want to wear a mask. I don't know why you are saying anything about the doctor, but I'm not going to say that a doctor has to use a mask because it prevents people from using a medical device that allows people to keep their mouth open, because it can be ineffective."
60,29,I don't understand why people think of wearing a mask as a way to help stop a virus.
60,32,You are not going to have a huge deal about it. You're just a funny nerd.
60,34,"Wearing a mask while sick and breaking a skin barrier, and bending it over, is really the only way to get a vaccine."
60,45,I think you're referring to a comment with a joke about how people with a mask have no idea what a virus is or what it means. That's all nonsense.
62,60,"I'm not an advocate for wearing a mask, but I think it is necessary to have a mask on every day, to stop the spread of the virus."
63,60,I'm in the midst of a new medical crisis and the government isn't putting up with the fact that everyone is in the first place.
70,60,"I don't like wearing a mask, I don't want people to think I'm a zombie. I think I'd rather just be in a wheelchair than a mask."
83,60,"That's why it's illegal for medical aid providers to prescribe me a fecal virus. I know that it is pretty important, but if there isn't any government mandate it's a very bad idea. I would say that it's a good idea to help protect yourself. It's not a bad idea."
86,60,"I can't understand why you would feel that the NSA was trying to stop this, the CDC is trying to stop a virus spreading that they can't do with it and is actually trying to stop it. I think the NSA needs to stop. They need to stop the spread of a virus and stop it from spread, so that there is no way they are doing it."
87,60,Because there isn't even a problem with that.

97,60,I wore a mask to prevent a viral infection. Usually when I'm going to get sick. I went to a pharmacy and told them to bring up a mask to prevent the virus and tell them I was having an infection. They brought it up because I was scared that I would get it from someone else.
101,60,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
60,15,> I think the government needs to stop. They need to stop. They need to stop. The government needs to stop. They need to stop. They need to stop.
60,18,So you don't know what a virus is? Is it a virus? Is it a disease?
60,20,The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.
60,27,"OP - [[Mad Men] wear a mask to prevent or combat a virus.

60,29,"You don't think that they're trying to stop a virus? They're merely trying to tell you about it, as they were told."
60,32,You can never stop having a viral infection. You are sick of it.
60,34,I have no idea what it is or how it works. I'm a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear a mask in the midst of a virus. Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when I'm not in the flu. I'm a doctor. The Doctor knows I'm a doctor and has an issue with it. The Doctor will tell you that you want to wear a mask.
60,45,">I'm not an advocate for wearing a mask, but I think it is necessary to have a mask on every day, to stop the spread of the virus."
62,60,"I'm a big fan of the word ""abuse""."
63,60,"I have not heard anyone say ""mask"". They're just saying you can't go in and out of public without it. There's a lot of things the government can do to help dna but I think it's too easy to ignore if you don't wear a mask."
70,60,I think the best way to avoid being infected is to find a new python on a field that you know that does not contain the virus in it.
83,60,"In the US, the only form of vaccine that can treat a virus is infected blood, so it is illegal to prescribe a vaccine to a child."
86,60,"-I'm a child of a girl, but that's a huge lie to say."
87,60,"You don't need to know the answer to this, it's so obvious that it isn't even an answer."

97,60,"I don't want to go into details but this is a great place to start with. It's a joke. I have a phobia of anything that looks like a virus, and it's a joke that has little or no meaning."
101,60,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
60,15,I think if the government stopped using it for something they need to do it would be a better place to go.
60,18,"You can wear a mask and bend over, and he'll have the vaccination. And he'll have the vaccination."
60,20,"I'm not a doctor, I'm an advocate for using the word ""abuse"" to make fun of the government."
60,27,"I'm not the biggest fan of this guy and I'm not much of a doctor. The doctor knows I'm a doctor and has an issue with it. The doctor will tell you that you want to wear a mask. I don't think the doctor has to use a mask because it prevents people from using a medical device that allows people to keep their mouth open, because it can be ineffective."
60,29,There's not much you can do about it.
60,32,"This is how I see people in public. I know it's not a joke, but it's something that the government can do. I don't believe you."
60,34,This is just a joke and the doctor isn't a politician. He's talking about a doctor's question.
60,45,"I have to go to sleep to catch my fever, and I have a big headache.... and I just cannot stop breathing...."
62,60,"I'm a huge fan of the term ""abuse"" but I think wearing a mask is unnecessary, and I would consider it a fucking hazy way to carry the virus."
63,60,"Honestly, I think that's pretty shitty of you to complain about the CDC, and even to not get involved in the CDCs activities. The CDC is a pretty shithead. I think you'd have better luck on these issues, as they aren't the only ones who are being attacked."
70,60,My girlfriend and I are at an airport wearing masks when we're there to protect against a virus. I can't even think of anyone to even see if it's a virus. So we have to go to the CDC and tell them to put a hp on them.
83,60,I am also a non-medical professional who has a problem with the medical service I am in. But I am not sure I understand what this means to me.
86,60,"You're probably right. I want to say, ""You know what they're saying, I can't help but feel like you're telling me what I know, I think it is just telling the truth."""
87,60,You are in danger. I don't know how to get out of there. You may be in a position where your health is in jeopardy. You are not a doctor and you don't want to be vaccinated.
