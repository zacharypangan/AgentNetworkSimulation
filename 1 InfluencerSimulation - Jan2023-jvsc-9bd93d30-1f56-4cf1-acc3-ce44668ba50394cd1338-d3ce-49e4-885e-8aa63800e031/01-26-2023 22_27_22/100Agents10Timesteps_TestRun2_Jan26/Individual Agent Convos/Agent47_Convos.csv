61,47,"I think we all know how serious it's going to be, but when people go on dates with people that aren't lawyers, they can't just say, ""I don't think it's a joke, you don't need to be careful."" Then they can come back and say, ""Well it's not funny, and this is a horrible joke."" Then, in all fairness, if they want to get offended, they can come back and say ""Well it's not a joke, if you're a lawyer,"
62,47,They can also do it by making it uncomfortable and putting on a mask. That's the most important part of the story... they have a few things he should know:
63,47,"There's a plethora of things they do to stop people from spreading a virus. But the CDC hasn't been trying to do anything. It seems like they don't have a lot of things to do, but they do."
65,47,"The thing is, I don't like a lot of people wearing masks."
72,47,The government is committing to “stop the spread of the virus” because he is trying to show that “We have a way to prevent that virus.”
76,47,"This is the first post that comes to mind for anyone attempting to understand a concept such as a ""medical mask"", or just as it is used in a medically erotic way. This is a very important, eloquent and a well thought out solution."
83,47,I read an article recently that attributed his use of a mask to a problem with a fecal infection.
90,47,"[Redditor here: I don't know what that's about, but I like that it's pretty normal. It's a little different than a lot of people) I'm not sure why you're even bothering to read that (it's just that it's so common) I feel like there's some kind of trickle-down aversion here: You're saying that the idea of a prank that goes with a mask and I'm being offended by it,"
91,47,"I'm not sure if the NSA understands that or not, but what i'm asking is ""why?"""
97,47,"""When you put a mask on, it helps stop the spread of a virus,"""
99,47,The article makes you think that this is a ridiculous thing to do. Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus.
47,4,>We have a new policy against wearing a mask.
47,9,Yes. If I'm in the situation of somebody being in a bad situation a doctor could possibly put up a mask to make sure there is no infection.
47,13,"I am so sorry, I don't know what you are talking about."
47,14,So they don't think it's a joke?
47,17,">I've just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on, so I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.”"
47,25,I don't understand why people are being offended by the idea that people are being offended by wearing masks. I do believe that putting on a mask would be a huge help to prevent the spread of a virus.
47,30,It's a very real and very complex thing. You're not going to get away with it if you don't like it.
47,32,"It sounds like the video of him in a mask and he's not even a fan of that. The article is misleading, if I remember correctly."
47,34,The NSA's inaction has nothing to do with the fact that the CDC doesn't actually have a way of stopping the spread of a virus. They're going to use this idea as a smear campaign to get more people sick. That's why they do things like that.
47,38,"I didn't write anything about this, I didn't actually read it. It is an interesting point."
52,47,"I've just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn't wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn't even able to wear a mask at all."
54,47,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
58,47,">[This is a good example in a lot of ways and they've gotten to the bottom of it. People are more willing to learn about this than ever. People are more willing to learn about this than ever."""
61,47,"It's a joke. If your husband blew a joke, he would go around doing it."
62,47,"I am going to go and make a good point, I guess. But, if it was something a doctor would order, I would not wear a mask on a plane. This is very likely a federal mandate, in my opinion, because I have been told that wearing a mask will not prevent you from having a virus. I don't like wearing a mask, but I would definitely wear one on a plane."
63,47,The CDC used to work for a large anti-viral company.
65,47,"I was once told that in some parts of the world we wear a mask for protection and protection, but only if it is worn, or if it's not worn. When we started looking for people to protect us, we were given this ""no mask"". We don't have to use our masks to prevent the spread of HIV, unless we want to protect them from any of the things that can occur."
72,47,I'm sure a lot of people in the public health sector have no problem wearing a mask because they want to be safe and to be able to help. You're making a pretty reasonable point.
76,47,"The whole thing is so well-done, and then if you don't, you're all gonna just throw your ass in the water!"
83,47,"There's a lot to go around to protect people from fecal infections in general, and that's why a mask is needed."
90,47,It is a prank. We are a little different than you are but you're going to need the same kind of attention as people are.
91,47,"I would never put a mask on in public for anyone I was in the NSA with, and if that were the case, I would be a little embarrassed for not having said it, but it makes me really think that my life is good. My work and my friends go through the same, sadly. That I need to be in front of a wall, and at the same time, I'm getting in front of a TV screen."
97,47,A lot of people don't care about what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
99,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,4,"The point of the policy isn't to prevent spread of HIV, but to help people in those who do the work to prevent the spread of the virus."
47,9,"You are not the one bringing it up, but your body isn't the one."
47,13,This is an example of a bit of a prank that gets more attention than the reality of something you can't really tell me.
47,14,"The CDC has the power to do what they want, and he has a legitimate right to do it. He has a right to do it. He can get away with it."
47,17,I'm very sorry to be of the same opinion on a bunch of topics.
47,25,">but in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
47,30,"Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
47,32,I think he is doing it wrong.
47,34,"This is an interesting point. I’ve just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn’t wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn’t even able to wear a mask at all."
47,38,"You've already said you don't want him to wear a mask, you've just come to realize it's been very bad for your health and the environment in general. He's in the US and should be making a real effort to help, no matter what he does. I'd not wear a mask to protect myself, but I think that he is going to make a good point, in fact, because of the way he feels about the situation."
52,47,"I mean... if you're not a doctor, and you're vaccinated, you're not allowed to wear a mask. That's fine. And if you wear a mask, you're not allowed to wear a mask, you're not allowed to wear a mask. That's fine. That's fine. But if you wear a mask, you're allowed to wear a mask, but you're not allowed to wear a mask, and that's if you want to, then you have to wear"
54,47,It's a joke. It's a very obnoxious thing.
58,47,"I think the joke might be a bit out there, but I think that you are correct."
61,47,"It is a joke. The NSA is helping to stop the spread of a virus. A lot of people are allergic to the viruses and get vaccinated for it. It is not a joke. It's not a joke, just a little inconsiderate."
62,47,"I think it is time to make a new movie about the movie and maybe get a new mask, but if I were you I would say I would."
63,47,">I'm quite shocked by this, but i thought wearing a mask in the holiday season would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask."
65,47,">The thing is, I don't like a lot of people wearing masks."
72,47,">He's not going to change, he’s going to get a new hat, and be honest with his wife about the situation with his new hat."
76,47,"Yes, it is a joke. Vaccination isn't about prevention. It's about prevention."
83,47,"In general, we want to prevent those who don't wear masks."
90,47,I'm in the same boat as a number of people. I don't know if I could pull it off or not.
91,47,"""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."""
97,47,"Whenever a person says that their friends don't care about what a virus looks like, they're saying, ""It's a joke and the only thing that isn't useful is the virus."""
99,47,I'm not gonna get you any better. You sound like a pretty awesome person and I've probably been working in healthcare at the time of this article.
47,4,"I was just reading the article. It's kind of funny, but a bit jargonish. You're not a jerk if you're not used to it."
47,9,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it. Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
47,13,The CDC is doing something different with masks.
47,14,I feel so sorry for the guy you've told us about this. I'm an asshole. It sounds like you're going to try to make some big deal out of it.
47,17,"Vaccination isn't about prevention, it's about prevention."
47,25,Well it would have to be a very short article.
47,30,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
47,32,"This is the kind of ad the people making up are attempting to justify. You can't get a fake mask and go with a joke about being a doctor without telling the truth, or even expressing their own opinion."
47,34,"I feel like I could have made this joke just fine. I don’t care for masks and don’t like wearing one. But if I could, I would."
47,38,Vaccines and virus preventants are both extremely important and not just to save people from getting sick.
52,47,>I've just been vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
54,47,I'd probably rather be a doctor and just keep that in mind.
58,47,"""... and I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me. I’ve just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on, so I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.” I’ve sat around with it and I love it because he is really a gentleman. I’m kind of nice to him because he’s not a f"
61,47,The NSA has been known to use the CDC as a propaganda tool to protect children from HIV. So it's no wonder people are so terrified of the CDC.
62,47,"The NSA is going to try and impose the strictest laws on all people, even those whose immunity is reduced or eliminated by doing so. Sadly, the NSA is not helping the population."
63,47,The CDC isn't doing anything. They don't have a lot of things to do.
65,47,"No one can know what the ""the problem"" is."
72,47,"I'm sorry but we are in a period of time where we are experiencing a real, real, public health emergency. So I can't say to you what's been going on."
76,47,"I don't like that you're just trying to hide a joke, you don't like the part where they just let people have a safe mask of a virus and try to mask it. Vaccination is about prevention. I hate the idea of being able to go to a doctor and give them a mask. And then to go into a doctor's office to talk about how much they mean to the community about the vaccination and /or a medical professional and how it can help them avoid their vebb and their illnesses in the future. I want to stop"
83,47,The federal government must do whatever it wants to keep people alive.
90,47,I can't say I'm offended by it.

97,47,"You're going to need to stop hating a virus. I'm not going to give you a warning, but you're going to need to stop hating it."
99,47,"Basically, the article says that if someone wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, they're more likely to have some sort of fear of them being harmed and not being able to fight the virus themselves."

47,9,Vaccination is about prevention. It is also a kind of anti-viral.
47,13,They don't have the power to stop the spread of the virus. They have to do what it takes to stop it.
47,14,I am not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I don't get why people are so concerned. I have no right to pretend that a doctor can protect me from HIV because I've never been vaccinated and I've only been allowed to have a few vaccines. Its all a problem.
47,17,"If someone was going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me."", the CDC and the CDC could have been better off."
47,25,I don't think you are offended. The CDC is doing nothing to keep people from getting sick.
47,30,"This is the same type of thing that happened to me. My wife got sick from the AIDS virus, and I got sick of being stung by an X-ray, but that really didn't help. I'd rather be the doctor and have a more peaceful life than be left alone with this shit."
47,32,I'm not sure I understand why the CDC isn't doing anything. A mask of the virus can actually be used to spread the disease. The CDC is basically trying to help people with it.
47,34,"Yeah, you're being very clever here, but I want you to know this:"
47,38,Vaccination is one of those things.
52,47,I'm gonna call him 'The 'fuck' if he ever says the same thing?
54,47,"It's not funny. I just read a few comments. I've been here for more than a year and I've been here for months, but I'm still very confused."
58,47,"I haven't been wearing a mask in a while, and it still seems a bit awkward at first. It's more of an excuse to not shave my face or face when I'm out of my mind."
61,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think most people are confused and confused as to why people wear a mask and then the NSA says: I think we should look at this as ""a lot of people are confused and confused as to why people don't wear a mask."""
62,47,There's a bit of confusion about the reason why people want to wear a mask on a public plane and that they think it would be good to stop it? Why can't it just be a joke?
63,47,>[...I'm sorry about your rant and I hope you don't feel a lot of pain. He doesn't care about his health. He's not telling him about it. I'm not really saying that I can't fuck with santa but I do see a problem with wearing a mask. Wearing a mask.
65,47,Why isn't the government providing a mask because there's a LOT of unidentified people who aren't able to detect it? That's kind of a weird problem to have.
72,47,'.I've had a dog with a mask in a public place since age 8. I can't help it but it still is scary and traumatic. I don't think it's going to stop the dog.
76,47,"Vaccination is about prevention. You don't know how to explain it to me. I mean, it's a joke, but a lot of people don't understand. It's about prevention. Vaccination isn't about prevention. It's about prevention."
83,47,"Wearing a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. I'm sure this is a good one to make sure nobody is hurt."""
90,47,It doesn't work. That's the whole point of a prank.

97,47,The joke that masks are a joke has no meaning and is an idiomatic part of the lexicon.
