101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

87,7,"I don't even know what you think about the anti-virus. They say that they're an effective solution to the problem, but they're wrong."
87,10,"I'm a bit shy because I do have a weird kind of facial expression and I can tell people that I have no sympathy for the person wearing it in public, and that I do not want to suck on a joke. But what is your problem with your mask?"
87,14,"I always say people can be invisible and scary. People are the ones who have to face fear, and sometimes the fear isn't that obvious."
87,21,"I love the sexist fucking words but I'm not a big fan of the sexist, racist shit like that."
87,22,"This is a common rooster apology that you'll always get from someone with autism and this is the only one who's not very fluent. That's why everyone knows, they want to know how to deal with this."
87,23,What about wearing a mask when you're scared? You don't know how to deal with that.
87,36,I just got back from a trip to the states and they said that you are wearing a mask outside when you are vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.
87,40,"I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. Vaccinating is an integral part of being able to deal with the virus."
87,42,"If you have a facial cavity, why not wear a mask outside? The first thing people should know is that there are some symptoms. And if there are some that are not, why don't they try it yourself, or is that something merely temporary?"
87,43,This makes me think about how much people have to make about it.
87,45,"I just want to say i really have no problems. If people like me want to get vaccinated, and I've been wearing a mask in public, I want to be safe. It's not my job."
87,52,"I'm also a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Doing a mask outside while vaccinated is a great idea, but vaccinating someone in their face to help in the fight against HIV in the US doesn't sound like much of a better idea than doing a face mask outdoors at work, or a mask in your car in public, or even at school, and the vaccine doesn't ward off the germs or make them sick."
87,55,My dad always wears a mask i've got to wear when he's vaccinated.
87,60,"What do you think people are saying is, the fact that this is not a problem is a symptom of HIV. It is a disease and it's a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus."
87,61,Vaccines are good for you if you like people not being scared.
87,66,It seems like an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
87,67,"I can tell you the answer to this question is that it's the only way to tell if you don't want to be vaccinated by a person, and not by asking people why they're doing something that makes them feel safe."

87,80,This is a rant about the face mask.
87,81,"I grew up wearing a mask to protect me from the Virus, but it was a great opportunity to expose people and let them know that I really do not know if anyone I knew would know about it, or not."
91,87,We know that our environment has very little social interaction with other people.

101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,A mask in the US is not required for vaccinating people.
87,3,Why would you wear a mask in public if your job is to prevent the spread of HIV. It's not a good idea.
87,7,You just answered an old question. Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,10,You are not shy? That is your problem.
87,14,Its not an answer that anyone will ever get right. But it is a nice way to put it. Its not an idea. That's not a reason to get infected and it seems like everyone else is. It just seems like they are afraid to act like people or have the desire to not feel safe.
87,21,"I think it's fair to say that it has something to do with the fact that if it isn't a good idea to get vaccinated and do it in public, it can be helpful in preventing the spread of other diseases. Vaccines are good for both a person and a society. Vaccines are better than not getting vaccinated."
87,22,Are you a medical student? Because it’s a major issue in the US.
87,23,"I don't get a lot of people asking if wearing a mask outside makes me feel safe. I get a lot of people asking why people are wearing it outside in public, and they get the same response."
87,36,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something."
87,40,"i was not talking about the avg, and i did have the avg a week ago, and i just wanted to make sure that I was comfortable with it. It seems pretty ridiculous that i can vaccinate others in public if i am able to safely wear a mask when i am in public."
87,42,I think they think there aren't any symptom of HIV. That's why they didn't have the virus as a priority for the disease.
87,43,"I don't want to put this in my head but I'd like to say it's one of the few times I've never thought about wearing a mask outside, because when it comes to preventing the spread of the virus in a person's face, they're not going to be so sure I wear a mask outside to help prevent it."
87,45,"I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear masks outside."
87,52,"Yes, there are some good reasons for wearing a mask, like because it prevents the virus from spreading into your skin, because it prevents blood vessel obstruction, and because the virus can make people sick, so it doesn't bother me."
87,55,I'm just a friend of one of those people.
87,60,Wearing a mask outside is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,61,"The article is a little too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true."
87,66,"You're a very ill person and the idea of vaccinating people is very interesting. I had no idea people would actually have the same problems as me, it's like being in an environment where I wouldn't ever feel safe and I didn't feel safe at all."
87,67,This is not a rant. This is not a rant.
87,73,It's also an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating. I'm also a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
87,75,"I want to be vaccinated as well. However, I feel bad about this because I'm a doctor."
87,76,"The fact that you are wearing a mask outside while vaccinated to help in the fight against HIV, is actually a pretty good example of people not being vaccinated."
87,80,A lot of people who do a r vaccination campaign are probably in the minority.
87,81,"We need more people who have a mask to deal with the disease as well. This is an insecurities, and a bad choice to make."
91,87,I'd like to share my story with you because I don't think you're going to hear your story.
98,87,I was just watching that one the other day because I couldn't believe that it was written by the actor who played it and I wasn't surprised it was written by him he couldn't believe it because I don't know who the actor was or what he wrote but he was a pretty sweet guy!

101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,"I mean I think you're arguing with a different person, and not to blame them, but you are correct. I can't blame the other person for being in the minority, and not addressing your point of view. It would seem like you are a really bad example of why this is such a bad idea. I know that I have seen this story before, and I understand the people that think a person wearing a mask should be vaccinated, but I think it's time for them to move on."
87,3,"This is a very interesting post. What is your opinion about ""the masks""? Is it a way to protect someone from HIV?"
87,7,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,10,People with HIV in the US are often the poorest people on the planet because they can't speak English well.
87,14,"****This is an insecurities, and a bad choice to make. ****"
87,21,"Well, you're not a doctor, but a doctor with a viral infection that is not a known problem. It's not that you should vaccinate someone. There are some reasons why people will do that, but this isn't really an issue that you should be vaccinating. It's not a problem in the least, it's a problem for everyone."
87,22,The fact that you are wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

87,80,It sounds like you are an immature child who has no idea what a mask looks like.
87,81,"As a child, I still can't stand this one. I'd never try it. You are sick, you just want to do it with a person who knows, who knows, and respects your own privacy."
91,87,"The idea of a 'protectionism' is a lie, but that's not the problem. The issue of people with a face mask, at the least, is the problem of people who don't know or care about the virus."
98,87,There is a joke about this one about wearing a mask to scare people
100,87,If you get sick you will be infected.
101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,"I'm a doctor, and i was vaccinated with HIV, but it didn't help. i was also vaccinated with a lot of the symptoms."
87,3,A lot of people who do a r vaccination campaign are probably in the minority.
87,7,The way people in r vaccination jibe about the wording of a joke about a face mask and the fact that it's a part of the anti-virus is ridiculous.
87,10,You're being downvoted to hell because you're not being helpful. You have to be respectful of your privacy.
87,14,"A lot of people who do a r vaccination campaign are probably in the minority. The article is a little too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true. You are sick, you just want to do it with a person who knows, who knows, and respects your own privacy."
87,21,"As a doctor, I'm not vaccinated."
87,22,I wouldn't put my face on a mask. There are literally thousands of people in the world that are sick and don't even know how to look up and say that they're wearing masks outside.
87,23,I'm a nurse and the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinated is very interesting. The ad is pretty great.
87,36,"This is a rant, not a joke. It's an honest conversation."
87,40,>Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.
87,42,I have a bad fever so I'm wearing a mask. It's my job to prevent it.
87,43,You are probably right about the people who think putting a mask on to try to get sick a lot is a good idea.
87,45,I'm a doctor and wear a mask when I get sick and I have an infection.
87,52,"""... you want to do it with a person who knows, who knows, and respects your own privacy."
87,55,The people wearing the mask are a lot of them.
87,60,Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus.
87,61,"I wouldn't do it unless I was infected, or in fact get a mask. It is useless and I hate it."
87,66,"I'm going to add: ""Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people."""
87,67,... because I am not in the minority... But I would wear a mask outside while vaccinated...
87,73,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,75,"I don't believe that the government is incompatible with something. They are talking about a virus, not a doctor."
87,76,"There are people who think that when a mask is on you, it will make them sick. Its a blatant attempt to take it away."
87,80,I'd be pretty sure you can get a face mask when you are sick without it. I just can't believe it's in the USA or anywhere.
87,81,"It's really, really, really nice of you."
91,87,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
98,87,There's the one with Jack that's pretty cool.
100,87,"I don't think this post has any context. I think it is a lot like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,"As a sane person with an HIV infection, I really don't know how that's even possible. The virus is the one I am vaccinated against."
87,3,"If you are sick, you should wear a mask. Vaccination is not a symptom of HIV. The government has been using it as a way to help stop the spread of it."
87,7,"I'm going to add: ""Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.""... because I am not in the minority..."
87,10,"We're so sick and vaccinated, we need an emergency to go outside to get vaccinated. I have a cough and a fever and I'm wearing a mask to prevent my infection."
87,14,I'm very interested in what the government thinks about these people.
87,21,You haven't said anything good about wearing a mask.
87,22,"I don't think this is in any context. The point is that you should have thought that if you get sick, you'll get sick. The problem with vaccination is not that people shouldn't put their face on a mask, but that it is a way to prevent infection."
87,23,"So, the joke would be: ""Well, at the end of the day, unless it's me, I'm the one who's getting the vaccinated, I can't wear my face mask, because I'm terrified, and I've got a terrible fever."""
87,36,>Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
87,40,So you are going to have to start a rant? Is this the same thread that you are ranting about? Or is there a rant that's really a joke?
87,42,I'm just going to have a little more fun with this rant than this one.
87,43,"Yes. I know you're right about that. And I would put my hand on a mask in the public place and tell people to stay away from you. I'm gonna have a conversation with you tomorrow about why you're wearing it in the public place, but no one wants to tell you about your opinion."
87,45,"Yes, they don't have a right to wear a mask outside. They just don't want you to think it's a good idea or that they should. They think that wearing a mask outside will increase your immune system and therefore your immunity could be reduced. Its not. They have no authority on the vaccine, that they don't have to change the law about the public safety of their children."
87,52,I have a friend that is on this list. He has no idea what's going on with his friends who are just being shit.
87,55,I think the people in this post are probably just describing a rabid anti-vaccination fan. The post is fucking off and fucking shit.
87,60,"I'm going to add: ""Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.""... because I am not in the minority... But I would wear a mask outside while vaccinated..."
87,61,"Is this a joke or a joke? It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
87,66,"I was wondering why this is going to be a rant, not a joke."
87,67,I was just reading this post in the mood for a joke.
87,73,"The point of a rant is to tell you to keep it on. If your a doctor, and vaccinated, don't put on a mask, you're putting on a mask. If you're a doctor, and you want to stay away from the government, don't wear a mask outside while vaccinated. It's a joke and doesn't make it relevant."
87,75,"I'm trying to guess, he's going to get pissed at a certain guy for putting on a mask and not a guy for wearing it. And then someone else says, ""Have you ever tried going outside to get vaccinated?"""
87,76,I want to give you some reasons to take it away.
87,80,"Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus. I'd be pretty sure you can get a mask when you are sick without it. I just can't believe it's in the USA or anywhere. It's really, really, really nice of you."
87,81,I'm a doctor and I wear a mask outside when I get sick and I get infected. That's what people tell me about the government.
91,87,"I was going to ask you, but I thought you said it best."
98,87,I think that 'The One With Jack' has one of the best and most entertaining stories that I have heard in years if not years. It is a great piece of literature that I think can give a lot of context for a joke like that.
100,87,"I don't have any context. I think it is a lot like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."" [http://www.reddit.com/r/en/uploads/2007/12/the-r/en-gif/r-frank_drool/uploads/2011/12/r/frank_dragon_who_had_the_advice_of_infected_advice_and_the_infected_python"

87,1,"I'm not saying you should not vaccinate, but this is a joke. I'm not saying it is a good idea, but I just think this is a little offensive. Especially when it's being used to confuse people with a serious threat. It's not like people are going to change their minds to prevent someone from getting the disease. I'd get rid of that mask."
87,3,">I am going to have a conversation with you tomorrow about why you're wearing it in the public place, but no one wants to tell me about your opinion.

87,7,There is a bunch of ridiculous shit like this on the internet.
87,10,I know that the point of a rant is to tell you to keep it on. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,14,My favorite is the One With Jack. Its a great piece of literature.
87,21,"I'm not saying that I have a right to vaccinat people. But I think I have a right to do so. I think I've said something good about doing so, but I don't think it would be right for everyone to think that I should go outside and get vaccinated unless they're sick. I would do so in public because I would not mind that, because they don't have authority on the vaccine and I don't think I'm in the minority."
87,22,What does your friend think is the joke?
87,23,You're talking about this ad. It's ridiculously silly that people on this list are doing something that's not relevant. This is about a virus. It's not about an immunity problem or being sick if it's a virus.
87,36,"Why do you hate ranting about the government? You're a doctor and if you don't know how to be a good human being, you will likely end up in the middle of a rant about something you don't think is a good idea. I'm sorry, but there are many people out there who might also want to know what's going on."

87,55,I can't believe this is an old joke.
87,60,Are you gonna get up and say something like this when you get up? It is the right thing to do unless you're not in the minority.
87,61,"It's a joke, but it makes sense, because the government doesn't have authority on the vaccine. It does not appoint doctors to vaccinate people, because they have no authority on it."
87,66,Is it possible that some people who don't understand what they're being sarcastic or offensive about the government are against a vaccine?
87,67,"This is a post that I had no reason to get excited about. I don't know if this makes sense, because I'm not the dr. That's a joke."

100,87,I think he's saying that the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't address the issue that is spreading. There isn't a big difference between wearing a mask and a virus.

87,43,The AIDS virus is spreading so fast and has no way of stopping it. Vaccinating people is a good idea but that's not what a vaccinated person would actually want to do.
87,45,"They do not have a right to vaccinate, and they don't have a right to make the government take their'serious actions'."

87,75,"Vaccine and prevention laws differ from state to state. I was vaccinated with an AIDS virus when I was 10 years old and still wear a mask outside when I get vaccinated, so my first reaction is to try it. It’s more common to get a sick person in the wrong place than to vaccinate."
87,76,"I feel like this was the joke of the week a few months ago, but I was not much of a doctor and I was vaccinated against a virus."

87,10,"Yes, a lot of people are still using a mask. If you don't have an adult that will be able to vaccinate you, then the mask is your best shot."
87,14,Vaccination is not a mandate to be vaccinated. It is an essential part of the government's duty to prevent this threat. I'm not sure how the government would want you to feel if you weren't vaccinated.
87,21,The government is working to save the world.
87,22,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated."
