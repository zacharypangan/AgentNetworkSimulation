50,29,I'm an American. What a man. I wear a mask in my house when I go outside. It makes me feel like I'm on the right track.
51,50,"It's a nice way to let people know that they don't think it's a big deal and that they don't want to be vaccinated. That is, if they think it's a big deal and they don't want to be vaccinated, they don't want to be vaccinated and that 'in your face' might not mean you aren't vaccinated."
62,50,"I've been through a lot of people who don't like wearing a mask. That's probably because I'm a bit insecure, but it is really important for people like me. And to help prevent the spread of the virus. So it doesn't take too long to have the same effect, and it isn't something I can do."

50,29,I don't think this is a great use of words. There's not much we can do. The 'good' part is that they make everyone feel like they're on the right track. We're trying to make people feel better but we're not.
51,50,It's a good sign they have a new policy against wearing a mask

50,29,"I think the big deal with that is the lack of a ""tainted"" mask (which has been removed by the government) in order to prevent the spread of the virus."
51,50,"There is a really good book on this topic called ""Letters to the Government."" It's a bit of a lie, but it's actually quite a good book."
