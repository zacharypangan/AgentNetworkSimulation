48,16,I... are you sure you ARE an asshole?
48,17,A lot of people are taking the government's job as a joke and just say it. I'm not so sure about that one.
49,48,"Is there a special shout out to mr Londono and ms. Latorre for wearing a mask? Because i know you would hate to be a part of a pandemic, so I can't help you."
61,48,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
65,48,"My office's main job is to keep everyone comfortable. My supervisor always told me when I took on a work job to go 'I don't need a mask' or 'I'm afraid if I do, I'll never get a job that's nice and comfortable'. I didn't expect it. My first trip was a short one, and we worked together for the next two days. All the people on the floor were very nice, and I liked that. I was really lucky."

83,48,"Isn't this a common adage? You know, the kind of stuff I do on a regular basis that just makes me feel sick, but not to mention a lot of people who don't realize it's a habit."
93,48,i would have put on a mask on a run
48,16,The NSA has an awful reputation for making mistakes and ignoring them.
48,17,>Isn't this a common adage?
49,48,"They also used to do it for fun when I was little. They even put up with some people who wouldn't wear their own clothes, but they wanted to help their kids."
61,48,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
65,48,Its just the government's job to keep people comfortable
67,48,"The answer is ""but you don't want to be vaccinated""?"
70,48,I can confirm this is also one of the asian countries I have visited with our workers. I live in a cdc airfield and every time we use the airports to control the spread of a virus it's mandatory and you can't wear a mask because you can't vaccinate people. We need to vaccinate people.
72,48,"People aren't saboteurs. It's like saying a doctor could not tell you something, or a doctor could tell you that the doctor doesn't know if you're a patient and you're not a physician, and you think your family member is a saboteur."
73,48,"I'm not sure if a lot of people actually care, or if it's just his attitude."
75,48,"It's called ""Panthering at the Party"" in English, and it's called the ""Panthering at the Party"" in German. The term is intended to imply that the person that is ""snapping"" on is a part of the virus's genetic makeup."
83,48,I’m so glad there’s one of these people who really needs a mask and it is so much fun.
93,48,"There are many people in the world who have put themselves at risk and infected themselves. It's just such a big deal, for sure."
48,16,"I was a part of a group called ""The NSA has an awful reputation for making mistakes and ignoring them."" Apparently this is true even among the top 20 people in the world."
48,17,"I don't know if the answer is ""but you don't want to be vaccinated""? Is it, as it's usually called, ""Panthering at the Party"" in English?"
49,48,">I like wearing a mask when I run, and I don't think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day. If you're not a member of this subreddit, don't be a part of it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
61,48,I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on some other thing.
65,48,"I'd say if you're doing something that's not the best way to do it then it's better to have it. The tv, the news, etc. are all things that you could do."
67,48,I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?
70,48,"In other news, it is more likely that people will be more resistant to the vaccine as they can be more resistant to it. That means that the government will be more aggressive and will be more apt to help with this vaccine than the people who aren't in the US."
72,48,> I'm so sick from having to get the mask on because I didn't even know the mask acted like a dummy. I'm sorry that you're having an issue with your mask. That is the implication of the title.
73,48,People use statewide masks as a campaign to prevent people from getting the virus.
75,48,"Aside from the obvious implication of ""being a part of the cause"" it's also a problem with the way people wear their masks. I don't think it's bad or in any way wrong but there is a difference between a mask and a mask."
83,48,"Apparently if the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. That is the main thing you can do, but only if you are completely covered in shit, even in hospital emergency rooms."
93,48,"if you are a man with a shit head a guy might say something like ""i'm not a troll and you're not a troll"". he is a guy with a shit head but isn't a troll, he is a troll."
48,16,> I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?
48,17,I don't think it's wrong to wear a mask at the party when I'm in the field.

65,48,"I would wear a mask in public to protect myself, but I would wear a mask in the hospital."
67,48,Is it something to do with not being able to get up and start to eat if you can't stand your head up when you're wearing a mask?
70,48,"So, you just read the article and said that he is trying to stop the spread of a virus and he hasn't gotten the message yet. I think he's actually saying that he's actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. Specifically, he hasn't actually been doing the cdc or the government to stop the spread of a virus and that they need to get it out of the country."
72,48,IANAL but i can't believe a video of that being made with an audio book.
73,48,"It sounds like that's the biggest issue on the planet with this. This is the government's only job to stop the spread of AIDS, and the problem is he needs to stop it. And the problems will have zero effect."
75,48,The biggest problem is not that the idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.
83,48,"> Isn't this a common adage? You know, the kind of stuff I do on a regular basis that just makes me feel sick, but not to mention a lot of people who don't realize it's a habit. I'm so glad there's one of these people who really needs a mask. I've had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect. I don't know about the government but that's something you can get by just"
93,48,I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff.
48,16,"This guy has got some issues he could have had in his life, like when he had to get a full set of clothes from his friends, and had to wear a mask and a vest to get around his work on the job. This is also where he got to get his job in a few months."
48,17,"In a similar vein, the joke: “I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. That is the implication of the title. People use statewide masks as a campaign to prevent people from getting the virus. Apparently if the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. That is the main thing to do."
49,48,I don't want to talk about this because it's just stupid to say you're being a troll.
61,48,"I do not know much about what an HIV infection is, but I know that it's a flu."
65,48,"So i wear a mask in public and that is how my husband and I got out of the hospital. Then I take off the mask and leave the house. My husband would sit next to me and wear a mask. I think they would be happy with a mask. They want to help people prevent AIDS, because that is exactly what you said."
67,48,"My mom was in a hospital in Michigan to get her daughter vaccinated. Her mom is a doctor, so she wants to keep her friends and family out of the hospital."
70,48,"We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this. That's an idiotic rule, because they have no other right to do so. So what are you going to do with the mask?"
72,48,> I'm so sick from having to get the mask on because I didn't even know the mask acted like a dummy.
73,48,"I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of a day Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
75,48,I’m not sure what you mean by ‘no mask at all’. But it does seem like a simple word.
83,48,I am a little of a feminist so I think this is a good thing to post.
93,48,"OP is trying to be a troll. This is a funny joke that comes off as very clever, but I like the way you do it."
48,16,People should be safe as long as they aren't going to get HIV in their bodies.
48,17,"Yes, I know. I'm not sure if it is a good thing. I just think it's very nice to know the first one, and then find something similar to yours, because it might get more people interested in that."
49,48,The CDC is supposed to stop putting out pandemics to stop the spread of a virus.
61,48,Why is your boyfriend allergic to those things?

67,48,"I don't know where you're getting this from but I have no clue why it's in a US country. If it were in a US country, I would think they'd vaccinate the US in their area."

49,48,I feel so bad for him.
61,48,Well i'd say he's allergic to them. I think he was using a fake name and an image of a cigarette to avoid his wife who had been exposed to one during pregnancy to hide the virus.

He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. The guy who's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the mask.
