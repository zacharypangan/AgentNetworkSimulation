65,21,I hate that a virus can be easily spread without a mask. It can also be very uncomfortable. A virus will spread by itself if it is unknowingly spread through others.

65,48,"My office's main job is to keep everyone comfortable.

65,24,"It's the other way around, the person who wrote the article was actually actually joking. It was not to be taken as a prank, but rather an attempt to hush the message of it. Basically, it was simply a way for the government to work together and not go around bringing up the issue."

65,18,"The whole ""Penguin Prank"" thing is a joke that's trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus."

They're not even allowed to have people who wear masks."
