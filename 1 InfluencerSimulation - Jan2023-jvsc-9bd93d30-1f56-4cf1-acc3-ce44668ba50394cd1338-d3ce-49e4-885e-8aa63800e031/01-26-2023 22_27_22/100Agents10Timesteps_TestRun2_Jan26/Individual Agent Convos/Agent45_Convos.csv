45,39,"In some states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."
45,40,I think the idea is that there are other people who can do what they want. This is why the people in the first place are wearing masks. Thatâ€™s why they wear masks.
45,43,"What if I was the only one in the house, but the other person was the one in the house? The other person is the one in the house. So if you don't like it, maybe you should consider putting it on yourself."

87,45,"I just want to say i really have no problems. If people like me want to get vaccinated, and I've been wearing a mask in public, I want to be safe. It's not my job."
99,45,The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups.

The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups."
45,15,That is a funny thing to say. I can't even imagine how the government would want to stop that.
45,25,"I've got a hand lubricated one and I have to wear it after I am done vaccinating people in public. It's a great thing, but a hand lubricated one is not going to protect other people."
45,26,It's funny because there is a difference between a man wearing a mask and a man wearing a mask. I feel like you're referring to people who are wearing the same type of mask as me.
45,32,"Having said that, I think there's a difference between wearing a mask and a glove."
45,39,"As a non Republican, I'm not sure I understand why you are being downvoted. I think people have some logical arguments about how the people in the first place are wearing masks."
45,40,"I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
45,43,"I don't know about this, but I'm curious why anyone would wear a mask unless you got a virulent Virus in your car."

64,45,My friend just went on a date last week at a mall where the government put on a mask for her Gp and then we had the same problem - we didn't have to worry about people wearing the mask. I'm not surprised people wear the mask.

79,45,"I'm sorry but my family doesn't think we should be allowed to have masks on Thanksgiving in the US, even though there are still many people who might not want to be there. Rather, they would be in a state whose law allows for masks in those circumstances. And what we need is a new, better version of a mask. I like to think we will always have it on Thanksgiving. I don't even get to watch much of Christmas without one but my family has already had a lot of bad memories of it in the past month and it still doesn't have"
82,45,"I had a friend in the CIA who was working on a virus to help save the world. He was being sounded like an ostrich with a mask on, but it was not an actual bird. The man was a sniper that stayed in the air for days."
83,45,"My best friend wore a mask when she was sick. We went to the hospital, and went to a doctor who said they could make a mask that didn't look weird. He was so impressed that he couldn't take the tape off, so he asked her to bring a mask on in a crate. I thought she was so sick, and told her it was okay. They called the cops and tried to get him on the scene and he was actually in a doctor's office with me, but he went on to be a doctor. He"
87,45,"I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear masks outside."
99,45,A mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups. I think the point of wearing a mask is to avoid those two groups being able to use their force to spread the virus.
45,4,"And you're referring to a very popular, well known, one that is in many countries. You probably don't know who you are, but that's where this came from."

45,10,"It sounds like they're trying to get people to buy vaccines, as they are not in the United States."

45,14,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
45,15,"I've been sick of seeing this guy and his stuff all over the country, I'm not sure why he wears it."
45,25,"You do not have the right to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving if you don't want to. You can wear a hand lubricated one outdoors while vaccinating a person outside and a mask in a crate. You can wear a hand lubricated one in public as well, but it doesn't have to protect other people when they do a mask."
45,26,You're not wrong about that. I think that's a good way to think of it.
45,32,My husband wore one on Thanksgiving while he was sick. My husband wore one at my funeral.
45,39,"I'm not a Republican, but I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
45,40,I think it is a good idea. It isn't necessarily a good idea to put a mask on outside because of it being the only way to prevent a virus from spreading.
45,43,A person who was wearing a mask at the mall is not a criminal. He's wearing a mask while he's been vaccinated.
54,45,"I think that he's probably being ridiculous. The government is not invading my health because it seems that my 'free will' to wear a mask would help, but I don't think that's fair for a child to get vaccinated because it seems like he's a troll."
60,45,"This is a problem, I hate to be a dick, but people here seem to have a bad sense of humor."
61,45,It sounds like there's a lot of pressure for people to not wear a mask when they need to get vaccinated.
64,45,That's not a good idea. This is just a good idea that should be cited as well.
75,45,"It is a huge problem, and not a joke."
79,45,"This is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while. I'd sincerely want to rename it to a ""hug hat"" type thing."

99,45,"I'd be a little surprised if there's only one person in this subreddit. This is the type of guy who would never care what you do here, that's my job. I didn't have a whole lot of time to read it. And thanksgiving would have been a better time to watch it. Iâ€™m just glad to see that Iâ€™m wearing a mask in the holidays and that itâ€™s only really the same as the masks, just not the same. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this."
45,4,"The CDC says ""This is a funny thread because this is why I get vaccinated, but I'm not wearing my helmet. I have been wearing a helmet for over 10 years and haven't gotten to the point where I can't even stand it."" It's not a good idea, but it's a better idea.

45,13,"You said a'mask protects other people he only cares about himself', but you're just going to have to put your head out of your mouth to have a safe place to get checked out. It's all right."
45,14,Why would the people who don't wear the mask wear it outside on Thanksgiving be a bad idea?
45,15,"This is about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
45,25,The whole idea of wearing a mask outside on Thanksgiving is just stupid. I don't see how it can hurt other people's health.
45,26,You said the same thing in your original post.
45,32,"I'd suggest that a little bit of a bit of an apology for the man is to ""give your child a free shot"" in the face, or to use the word 'hug hat' and ""so to keep your lungs open."""
45,39,"So if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside."
45,40,I read the whole thing a long time ago.
45,43,I think the mask is a better idea than what most people think. It is a way to prevent the spread of the Virus.
54,45,>I know some kids who are so sick of wearing a mask as a means of protecting against any potential spread of a virus.
60,45,"I don't understand the question, but it sounds like there is a lot of stuff to be said. The first post is a joke, not a meme."
61,45,>I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
