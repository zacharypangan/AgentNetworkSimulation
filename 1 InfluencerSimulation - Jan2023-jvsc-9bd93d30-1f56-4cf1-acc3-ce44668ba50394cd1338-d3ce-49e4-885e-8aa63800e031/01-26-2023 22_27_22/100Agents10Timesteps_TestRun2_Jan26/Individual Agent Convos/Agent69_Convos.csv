90,69,I'm from Oregon. I have been there a few times. I have worn the mask several times over the years. It's a really good excuse to do the dirty work.

69,43,Hey.. What is your name? I just got this - I'm still wearing my mask every morning.
69,44,I am a full vaxxed W proof.
69,52,It's the same as a face mask. Wearing a face mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,69,"It's like a CDC thing. Isn't it even remotely possible to wear a mask in the US? If so, the CDC is going to stop the spread of the virus. That's really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
85,69,It is kind of hilarious to me when I read about how this guy said he was gonna get a lot of people talking about this and the shit people said he is.
86,69,The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
90,69,"I don't like the joke about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me."
91,69,You can't keep a hygienic face mask on on the table that doesn't fit on a computer.
69,15,>The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
69,40,So you're trying to think of this as a joke? That's not true.
69,43,"It doesn't matter what your name is, as long as your face mask isn't too dirty and the CDC doesn't contaminate your skin by spraying it with any nasty chemicals it's not too difficult to work with."
69,44,I have a friend who is very sick of this. She's really sick of it.

70,69,I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better.

86,69,"... And then the NSA says, 'Waving a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again', ""This is why I don't wear a mask, I only wear a mask to protect myself. I don't think I have the right to wear a mask, but I wear my helmet when I can't see my family."""
90,69,"I like your style, but I think it's more like a good one and a bad one."

69,44,"I've just got a little bit of a virus in my face - not sure if a friend of mine really cares or if she's a sick or uninformed person but I don't see that being a joke is going to make you uncomfortable. You are doing it with a friend who is sick of it, I don't want your mask to be dirty and the fact that you can't keep a hygienic face mask on the table that doesn't fit on a computer. You can't wear a mask or "
69,52,'It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,69,So you have a few choices here. One is to make a mask and the other to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
85,69,He wants his own dog to go to school and to get a new one. I can't believe he did. This is the one thing that I don't like about him. I know that people don't know that.
86,69,Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.
90,69,This is a pretty typical slapstick -- joke. It's so cute.
91,69,...and the worst part of this is that the government is not interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
69,15,"No one is going to be able to go out with the truth, and it isn't a slapstick joke. It's a joke that's meant to hurt people. It's not a joke, and it's a joke if the reality isn't slapstick."
69,40,The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
69,43,"In a world where people want to keep masks on and have them removed, they are getting very angry."
69,44,"I don't know if that is a joke, but I do know it's not the NSA, which is based on a slapstick meme."
69,52,"I think the most interesting thing is that when the NSA tells the joke that all people need to be safe, that some people need to wear a mask to protect themselves and to protect themselves, you say, ""we're being crazy, this is a joke."""
70,69,"So I have to get a mask. But I don’t want to be around people without their dog, but if I did, I’d have a very easy time knowing what’s the problem."
85,69,"A lot of people say this was a nice joke, but I think that's the one that came to mind."
86,69,"This is why people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.... And then the NSA says, ""Waving a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again."" I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn'"
90,69,"It's not a joke, I just feel like it's a little funny and I think it might be funny to me, not to you. I'm not sure why you're even bothering to read that (it's just that it's so common with a lot of people)"
91,69,"I want you to know that there is a big issue with a mask that people don't wear, so you're essentially saying it's necessary. You need to understand that."
69,15,It's kind of a strange joke i know.
69,40,"If you're still wearing a mask, you're just using it as a dick move. It would be a bit weird to try it on someone else."
69,43,It's not a joke. It's an act of a few people that are just like you.
69,44,"Almost any government program has to offer some kind of vaccine, as long as there are none that are bad or infected. You need to change your mask to one that is on a table, with a mirror on it."
69,52,"I'm sure people do like these jokes. What you say is absolutely true. It's not a joke, but it makes you feel like you're missing out on something valuable."
70,69,"As long as it's not the CDC doing anything to stop the spread of the virus, you are safe. The CDC doesn't really know what a mask is. But at least the CDC can be very quick to put a stop to it because of what is actually going on with their office, not what's going on with the health department. I wouldn't worry about the safety, just do whatever it takes to keep your mouth shut."
85,69,It's actually a joke. It is a joke.
86,69,"You said you're a puppet, right?"
90,69,The one in this thread says that it works. It's like they had a prank that is funny to someone if they weren't in their home and there is no way to tell them. But no - the rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of the word course is pretty nutty.
91,69,"A good example of this is the CIA being a good guy - ""The NSA is making a bomb on a family friend. So now the kids don't know what a virus is, they know that if you tell them you don't have a virus, they might be interested in having you wear a mask."" That's the part of the NSA's argument that you shouldn't be using your mask to hide a virus."
69,15,... he's being a joke in a nutshell.
69,40,I think this is how people make it so it doesn't sound so nutty. It's because the NSA makes them so stupid because they don't actually understand what they're doing :-)
69,43,"Basically, the joke is a joke where you tell people ""you're the joke but you're not the joke"" and then ""we're getting very angry""."
69,44,"It's actually a joke, and not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, and I don't know why, but you can still use it."
69,52,So you're saying the NSA is doing some good at hiding your virus?
70,69,"My mom got me a mask for her birthday and we went outside and were all about it. She snooped on it with her dog while he was in the hospital. They thought I was funny, she thought I was weird and she told me that I didn't know what a python was. She just started talking about the pythons and was like ""hey, are we going to put our pythons in a mask?"" Then they said it's funny that I would tell everyone she was a bit upset. She"
85,69,Is there a better way to take him seriously than with the NSA?
86,69,"I've gotta be honest. I'd be lying if I said this in the title, as someone who actually has never been in public before, but I can't say for sure what I think the truth."
90,69,"i like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me."", ""I like your style, but I think it's more like a good one and a bad one."", ""I'm gonna say, I don't like this."
91,69,"I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a great idea, but in my opinion I don't think the NSA understands the issue."

69,40,Yes. Apparently that's a joke that's just not funny.
69,43,What exactly is a prank?
69,44,"- ""But what do you know about this, I don't know if it is a joke. I'm sure people do like these jokes."
69,52,"The joke is, ""I'm gonna say, I don't like this. I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a great idea, but in my opinion I don't think the NSA understands the issue. I've gotta be honest."
70,69,"Honestly I don't like wearing a mask because it doesn't have the ability to stop the spread of the virus, and I don't think there is anything worse than the fact that people in our own country do wear masks."
85,69,I don't see how anyone would be in a position to be able to genuinely tell people about a viral or disease that he did not know existed. But the truth is the NSA is a raging animal that is using masks to get people to wear them because they feel they're not being used in the correct way. It's an inhumane tool that doesn't exist because people have no knowledge of what a virus is.
86,69,"This article really reminds me of how we are taught the word ""mask"" in English class and the way people use it."
90,69,"It sounds to me like they have a problem with the people on the streets. I have never heard of a prank like this, but I really want to see the joke."
91,69,">What are you doing here? [I was not allowed to see your comment.](http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea. if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I haven't heard the CIA"
69,15,I'd probably go to the doctor and explain the idea that a mask could be used against people who wear them because they think they're being abused.

69,43,"This isn't a joke, it's an act of a few people that are just like you."
69,44,"So, the guy is a CIA agent."
69,52,"Honestly I don't like wearing a mask because it doesn't have the ability to stop the spread of the virus, and I don't think there is anything worse than the fact that people in our own country do wear masks."
70,69,"This is what is referred to in a bit about what is called a ""no vaccination"" response. It seems like they are really doing a great job at the government putting in place this rule so people have an easier time deciding how to address this. It seems to me that they don't know how to fix it."
85,69,The NSA was to stop the spread of a virus.
86,69,"I have been in the NSA and I know it's there to help prevent it and that it works, but it's still a bad idea to wear a mask."
90,69,This is not a joke. It is a joke. This is just a prank.
91,69,"My brother would always say something like ""I am not a big fan of the NSA. I like it when a child is infected by viruses, but I also think it is a bad idea for children to be allowed to be sick."" Apparently, people aren't allowed to know the difference between a virus and a virus. It's not ""I am just a teenager."" Unless it's infected in a child's hand. Especially if you have a little kid. Basically, it isn't even close to the "
69,15,"I've heard some good things about this, but I haven't found the source."
69,40,"I have a friend that is very good at writing jokes. He was really funny with his 'What is your name?', but I was not allowed to see him on my own. I think he knew how to do a prank. I wasn't into pranks or anything like that. The one time I got sick and told my dad I had the CDC. He said something along the lines of, ""I'm in a bad place and this is a prank and I'm not going to get a prank but I don"
69,43,I believe the NSA just started making a joke about the use of masks when some people are infected with a virus.
69,44,"""You can't keep a hygienic face mask on the table, with a mirror on it."", ""I don't know if it is a joke. I'm sure people do like these jokes."
69,52,The article states that the government is using the NSA to spread a virus. This is a joke.
70,69,"The problem is that they can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" response."
85,69,"This is the type of comment I'm getting if a lot of people are saying ""Missing a mask on your birthday is a joke, but i think that's the one that came to mind."""
86,69,I'm gonna say it is a bit weird.
90,69,"A lot of this seems to get a lot of a response. A prank that isn't a joke and is a prank isn't supposed to work. This is a funny story, but the prank is a prank if you're not sure about the meaning."
91,69,"Basically, it isn't even close to the '' I can't even imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!""."
