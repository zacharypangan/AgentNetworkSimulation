55,3,"Its a pretty common reminder to get sick by going to a medical facility. I've never tried that, but it does feel good to know that it's a good idea and doesn't scare the crap out of the crowd."
55,5,So is wearing a mask the way that the government uses it? It's part of it.

66,55,If you can get my rabid kids around you with a mask you should definitely consider that.
75,55,I wouldn’t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic.
81,55,Wearing a mask does not help stop the spread of the virus.
85,55,"It has been around for quite some time now, but I've never seen a very good one."
87,55,My dad always wears a mask i've got to wear when he's vaccinated.
96,55,Wearing a mask and bend over
99,55,"You mean wearing a mask for the holidays? I know this isn't a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear it. That's why we get a lot of jokes like ""Hello there. I really don't care what you do here, that's my job."""
55,3,"It's a bad idea. In the U.S., it's the government's responsibility to prevent people from getting sick because they want to keep their skin from getting dirty, while the government's responsibility is to protect people from getting sick and preventing people from getting sick and spreading viruses. It's just not the people's job to stop them from getting sick."
55,5,> I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask
55,26,I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over.
55,35,It's not part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread.
55,40,This is why I don't wear my mask and do not wear my face.
55,54,"I think the government is trying to get more attention into the issue, and I think it is unfair to assume that ""not wearing a mask on your face in public can help you stop the spread of a virus."""
62,55,There is only one way to prevent this.
66,55,That is a very valid question to ask someone why they are always wearing a mask to protect themselves from the flu. It seems like an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
75,55,I don't really like my gov't being the one putting out a pandemic and I would be going to a party with a house full of people who weren't in my face.
81,55,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of the virus.
85,55,I wonder if this is why they were allowed to go to a park on their own if they were the only ones who couldn't make it Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

99,55,"I like this sub. OP is the one who said ""I'd love to see a copy of that book and the whole 'I wish you were wearing a mask' concept in the future."
55,3,"Yes, that's a fucking good idea. I can see the point though."
55,5,> I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask
55,26,It's just an excuse for the people in the party whose masks a couple of months ago were not removed.
55,35,"A lot of people eat that shit in public anyway, like a big apple."
55,40,I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus?
55,54,I have a friend who has done this to me. He's also the person who always asks me to wear a mask. He was the one who thought it would help him. It sounded like his face was being thrown at him. He didn't care and I had to get vaccinated.
62,55,I think there's a lot of people that are going for a jump on this one.
66,55,In addition to the massive covids I have mentioned on this sub... santa should have a mask. Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them.
75,55,"I'm a doctor so I would be ok with this. I am getting a lot of comments on this topic from people in different walks of life, but this post seems to have a lot to do with the fact that you are trying to come up with a way to prevent a pandemic because you want to be a part of the government, not the other way around."
81,55,"My grandmother was in this situation, and her mother was the one wearing the mask. She wore it every day to protect herself and me. She's been trying to eat a whole salad for years and got sick, and she's even wearing it at home now. It was one of the biggest mistakes she's ever made. I always wanted a mask that I could wear every day to protect myself. I didn't have to wear a mask because it was a joke, so I kept it with me, and I'm trying to get people sick and sick of it. So I"
85,55,"Despite the fact that he wore a mask on his birthday, that doesn't change the fact that he is still working for the government, the govt., and his family are resentful of it."
87,55,"The article is a little too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true. You're a very ill person and the idea of vaccinating people is very interesting."
96,55,"the gif, and the description:"
99,55,"I'd like to have a copy of that book and the whole 'I wish you were wearing a mask in the future. I'd wear a mask all year, and if I had one, I would. I'm just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask all year, and if I had one, I would."
55,3,"If I can see the point of the OP's post, I'll take the time to read that one as well."
55,5,I can only think of one thing:
55,26,">I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over."","
55,35,This sub is very good. It’s not so much about the government but the fact that they’re trying to be the big apple. And they’re trying to be the government that wants us to put a stop to the spread of a virus.
55,40,"I think the post is too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true. I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask all year, and if I had one, I would."
55,54,"I think the whole concept of a mask is a little old. We could just tell that it might be an acceptable excuse or something. Then, maybe, one day the doctors at the school that isn't going to be taking part in the pandemic will realize it's not in your family, and put them on the meds to take care of their own health and provide for them. That would be a good idea."
62,55,"I don't care if it's for you, he was wearing a mask and that's what he wanted me to do. It's nice when you have a friend who wears a mask. It's nice when you have a companion, and the little person that's there in the background is sitting there with a hunk of stuff in his pocket."
66,55,"I'm a Republican, and this was the first movie I read."
75,55,"The first paragraph is a joke - I think the first thing we want to do is be more proactive about the anti-vaccination movement. RIP ""Girlfriend"""
81,55,I think a lot of people who actually are going to go for this shit and gonna stop going for it will just end up buying a mask.
85,55,"> Because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems."
87,55,The people wearing the mask are a lot of them.
96,55,This is a great example of the first thing in this movie that comes to mind.
99,55,I'd be a little sorry if it were me. But maybe I have some fun at the end.
55,3,>I'm a doctor so I would be ok with this.
55,5,I'm a doctor and my 'Family Time' theme song has been playing for nearly four years. It was an important part of my experience in school.
55,26,Having a friend that wears a mask is what makes me a sceptic. I think that it's a good idea to vaccinate your kids.
55,35,"The ""Old Boy"" is actually quite clever - you can't keep your face down because it's a joke. It's a joke that is very obvious but you're going to end up wearing it all the time."
55,40,Vaccinating people can get rid of a lot of viruses and is a huge one to deal with.
55,54,"> Because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebb and I have problems. The people wearing the mask are a lot of them."
62,55,">I'm just a big nut and i don't want my pet vebb to get sick of me and I don't want my husband to be around. I’m just a big nut and i don’t want my husband to be around. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he’s not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems."
66,55,"What's the point of the movie? If he's a vebbulldog he's not a virus in a mask. I don't want to help you with that, but you're the only one who has been able to stop this spread of a virus."
75,55,"RIP ""Girlfriend"" What's this? I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma."
81,55,">'Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of the virus.',"
85,55,No one has anything to worry about.
87,55,I think the people in this post are probably just describing a rabid anti-vaccination fan. The post is fucking off and fucking shit.

99,55,"I'm a doctor, and I wear a mask for the holidays. There is no ""Santa"" when I'm not wearing a mask."
55,3,The film is written by the guy who is defending the government and all that
55,5,I'm the kind of guy who says it's a joke a lot of people don't.
55,26,I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done.
55,35,In the last two paragraphs the CDC's jokes that they use to enrage and devastate people on the internet have actually been very effective.
55,40,"The first thing you should think about is how to treat a virus. This is just the beginning of a good discussion between people on the wiki, aka ""the government"" to ""stop the spread of a virus."""
55,54,"Vaccinating your kids is not just a problem, you need to be vigilant. And then, in the end, you have to be a troll in this thread to see how that plays out."
62,55,"This is an excellent and utterly absurd response, but I think you can see how much of it it’s based on your personal experience, as well as how you want to be treated. I think you could make it even more poignant to read it by the way. It’s like I’ve just said that the best thing I can do is be confident in my ability to make your personal decisions."
66,55,"That sounds pretty awesome, ya know."
75,55,"Well, I can't say I'm not a doctor."
81,55,It is not a joke.
85,55,"OP, you are a man of his word, so I would take this as your advice. Your post is clearly a little jumbled and repetitive."
87,55,I can't believe this is an old joke.
96,55,I don't wear a mask and bend over
99,55,I wear a mask for all holidays and it's part of the CDC's program to stop the spread of a virus.

55,5,"They are actually pretty awesome! What's the funniest thing I read?? I like the fuck out of it, but the fuck out of it, just make sure that's what you want to hear."
55,26,I see no point in wearing the mask.

55,54,I'm an Atheist and I've seen many cases of people wearing a mask. That's part of why people don't get vaccinated.
62,55,"It's an awful lot of people doing the right thing and making a good life decision is one of the most important things of any kind. You need a doctor, who is going to prescribe you medication and put you in the right place and you want to be treated."
66,55,Are you the one who doesn't get why a prank is a prank? I don't understand why people think the CDC should force people to wear a mask for the sake of preventing a virus.
75,55,"RIP ""Girlfriend"""
81,55,"That's a pretty common joke. It's in the CDC's own handbook. And it's part of what it is - an effective and limiting way to talk to your employees about HIV. It's a great way to deal with people, and it's not a joke at all."
85,55,"I don't get why he is'resentful' of it. The fact that he is still working for the government, the govt. and his family are resentful about it."

55,5,I am an atheist and I've seen many cases of people wearing a mask. It's part of why people don't get vaccinated.
55,26,> I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
55,35,"In a similar vein, I'd go along with this."
55,40,"Aww. It's been awhile since I went to the doctor, but I've been wearing it for all of the holidays. It doesn't stop me from getting the papilloma vaccine. It's not a joke. I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus."
55,54,>An awful lot of people doing the right thing and making a good life decision is one of the most important things of any kind.
62,55,It's a joke. What a joke. What is a joke.
66,55,There is a lot of nonsense on that sub.
75,55,"I have a little problem with PPLS, I wear a mask in a lot of parties."
81,55,I'm a doctor at a hospital in Maryland. One of the guys I see in the hospital wears a mask to prevent the spread of HIV in patients.
85,55,"CANNOTANSWER: The most famous of the three people on the NSA's ""secret mission"" was to stop the spread of the virus in the world. They knew they were coming to stop this and gave away some evidence of this as a joke and a joke."
87,55,People are still wearing the masks based on the viral spread of the AIDS virus.

99,55,> I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask.
55,3,"OP, i have to say you are hilariously ignorant."
55,5,The CDC has a big group of cynical moron-doctors.
55,26,... I'm going to lie to myself about the CDC and say they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
55,35,As an atheist I would never be bothered to wear a mask or to put it on. It is not a joke. It is a joke.
55,40,So there's a lot of misunderstanding going on here involving the ebola epidemic.
55,54,You are a troll.
62,55,>We're going to get more shit out of it and I think you'll enjoy it. I don't think that a joke is a joke. Just a joke.
66,55,"Vaccination is a great way to prevent the spread of viruses in your family, and it's really important to keep them away from you. If you think they are the good ones, you have to do something about it, and you have to stay away from those that have already tried to protect themselves. I suggest that you avoid putting yourself at risk and are prepared to work towards finding a way to prevent that."
75,55,It's all a prank.
81,55,"Aside from the fact that it's a joke, there's nothing to say about how it's dangerous and we're dealing with the spread of the virus."

62,55,What a joke. Just a joke. What a joke.
