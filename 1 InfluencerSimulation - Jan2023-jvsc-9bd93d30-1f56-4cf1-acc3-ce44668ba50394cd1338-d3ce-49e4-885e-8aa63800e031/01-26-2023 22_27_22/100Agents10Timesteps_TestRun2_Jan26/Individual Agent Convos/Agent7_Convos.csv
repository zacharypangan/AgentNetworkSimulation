7,3,I ran 5 miles to find this out a week ago.
8,7,Well that's an understatement. It's just a piece of crap.
14,7,Vaccination is a good idea. You could get covid and still be covered with a mask and have them vaccinated when you get sick.
15,7,"I d just like to say that this is one of the few things we can do to stop the spread of HIV (which is a serious, widespread infection)"
18,7,"I'm not gonna say you're wrong. But I know that when a man does something like that, it's not a good thing. You're not the only person who has to wear a mask."
44,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go
70,7,"I just thought they would be cool with a mask as long as you've been in the ER and you wear a mask in a pinch. That's the problem, not the mask."
81,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,7,"If a person doesn't want to get sick, a mask can kill them and if they want to get sick, they can be arrested."
84,7,i did a lot of traveling last year... and it was awesome
87,7,"I don't even know what you think about the anti-virus. They say that they're an effective solution to the problem, but they're wrong."
93,7,>The people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
7,3,"Vaccination is a good idea. You could get Covid and still be covered with a mask and have them vaccinated when you get sick. That's the problem, not the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
8,7,"It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it."
14,7,"The anti - pandemic virus is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread. I'm not saying that the government isn't wrong, but they should be."
15,7,Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt... This is the same person who said the government has a right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
18,7,Why the fuck is that a joke.
44,7,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world"
70,7,">Isn't it even remotely possible to wear a mask in the US? If so, the CDC is going to stop the spread of the virus. That's really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
81,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,7,I've been wearing a mask for 10 years. It is so much fun.
84,7,The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues. It's not about the mask it's about how big and obnoxious it is to have a mask.
87,7,You just answered an old question. Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,7,A good analogy would be to wear a mask and then throw a small piece of plastic in the trash... because that's what keeps the public frightened and I think you're right that it's a good idea.
7,3,"There are lots of very different ways to prevent a virus. If you wear a mask, you are not at risk of a virus. The problem is you can't be protected. And you're not protecting yourself from a virus. Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt. Wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
8,7,I can't believe people have been told that it isn't a big deal.
14,7,"I feel the same way, but there is no single way in the US to prevent something like that from happening. I don't really see why it's bad if you're a big fan of that idea."
15,7,"No, not the only thing the US government does is require people to wear a mask."
18,7,CANNOTANSWER WANT?
44,7,"In a lot of ways, we should always make people wear masks, and then make the government want to be good at preventing it from spreading. But not for being good at anything."
70,7,"I think the most important thing to remember here is that it doesn't'stop' the spread of a virus. If the government does, then it won't stop it. Vaccines are not mandatory."
81,7,Is it still illegal for people to wear a mask at work?
83,7,I have been wearing a mask for about ten years and I don't remember seeing one on my screen.

7,3,"It's been suggested to them that you should wear a mask while you're sick so that if you get a covid you can get it off, because if not the virus spreads anyway and it's so dangerous. I would say that if you really think putting on a mask does anything for you, there is a whole lot of shit going on there and it seems like a much better idea."
8,7,"IANAL, but I live in an ecstasy country where people always make fun of the 'teeth' in the movie, and the guy from the movie wearing a mask has had a great time. I don't think you are being too harsh on him, and I know it is the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, but at least he wears a mask."
14,7,"I don't understand what you're trying to say. I mean, it sounds like you're talking about anti-vaccination. The fact that it's being used to prevent the spread of a virus seems to be the basis of a lot of the discussion."
15,7,I think people should take a seat in the doc.
18,7,The first sentence makes it sound like you're trying to justify a man's behaviour by claiming a man has to wear a mask. In a way you're using a joke that's a joke. It is not.
44,7,"> In the US, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right. You need to get an eviction."
70,7,"We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
81,7,"The joke was that a person may or may not want to wear a mask on Christmas Day. It wasn't that everyone would want to wear a mask. It was the whole point of this post, that the government should not take a joke that you didn't make or that someone should do it. Then the idea of people wearing it on Christmas Day gets a lot of negative attention."
83,7,"It's not like it's legal, as the CDC and the NIH have said."
84,7,I can’t believe someone took a photo of a kid with a mask he wore while driving if that is the situation.
87,7,The way people in r vaccination jibe about the wording of a joke about a face mask and the fact that it's a part of the anti-virus is ridiculous.
93,7,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from?
7,3,">I don't think you are being too harsh on him, and I know it is the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, but at least he wears a mask."
8,7,"Well, this is a good thing because I know some of it. I just think it's a little crazy that this is the one of the many anti-mumps issues he's had to go through this past year or so. I know that he is being abused, but he sounds like a total asshole."
14,7,"The way I've read it so far, that doesn't seem reasonable."
15,7,"This is how if you don't care about your privacy, you'll lose a person."
18,7,"I'm trying to make the person who is referring to him as a jerk, but I'm trying to make him understand that wearing a mask is a bad thing and that there's a real threat."
44,7,"i like the quote ""I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world', 'In a lot of ways, we should always make people wear a mask, and then make the government want to be good at preventing it from spreading. But not for being good at anything.'"
70,7,"I know that people think vaccinating your pets will make you sick. I wouldn't want my kids to get ill without a mask and I wouldn't want to feel bad for their privacy. So what is your job, Kate? You're the kind of person who doesn't want to be around other people and you have to go to the CDC to help them, you're a veb. You need to take care of your children."
81,7,">The joke was that a guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor,"" and ""A man who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end."""
83,7,"It doesn't hurt that you're a kid, and you don't want to wear a mask."
84,7,The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues.
87,7,"I'm going to add: ""Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.""... because I am not in the minority..."
93,7,"Why do people like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
7,3,>I can't believe someone took a photo of a kid with a mask he wore while driving
8,7,I don't think this is the kind of thing that people are getting to think about.
14,7,Is there an issue about the NSA preventing the spread of viruses?
15,7,The government is just trying to do something to save lives.
18,7,"I mean, when I've ever seen an actual person wearing a mask on the run, I really have to know how to actually stop it. He's a mask and bend. He's not a mask and bend."
44,7,>I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe.
70,7,"You mean ""so how do we prevent people from getting infected with a virus?"""
81,7,"You have no idea what a mask is, and don't even have any idea why people wear it on their birthdays?"
83,7,"I can't help but think I've never seen it, unless you really want to. I just think you need to get off the health fucking wagon and get a new mask."
84,7,"So your husband says that wearing a mask does not prevent a virus from becoming a virus is ""sin""?"
87,7,There is a bunch of ridiculous shit like this on the internet.
93,7,"That was the first thing I thought of, but I didn't realize how much of a joke this is."
7,3,"In his introductory speech, he said, ""I think the problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. The government is just trying to do something to save lives."""
8,7,"The CDC and NIH work together to stop the spread of Mumps, and we're trying to do that right now. But what are the details of the plan?"
14,7,"I feel like this is the only way for me to show you that the government isn't just right, but they should be."
15,7,"People aren't going to put in the effort to stop the spread of the disease, or change it for the better."
18,7,So the word'shame' comes from'relationship'.
44,7,"In Texas, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right. You need to get an eviction."
70,7,'If you get sick you will be infected.'
81,7,I would be concerned that people might not think about the whole idea of wearing a mask on their birthday. That's not a good idea.
83,7,"I know the one who used to be a CDC and NIH expert, but isn't a physician?"
84,7,He doesn't care about his health. He's not telling him about it. He's talking about his wife 'fear' and then using the word 'event' for the whole thing. So what's your point here?
87,7,>Making a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,7,"People like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
7,3,"It's not about the health, it's about your health."
8,7,"It seems to me that the people who think the CDC and NIH work together are not the ones in the picture. And that's probably because they have a great idea, too. It's just not a good idea for people to keep looking for their own advice, and if you think people should go to the CDC and NIH in the first place it might be worth their time and effort."
14,7,"I've been in the NSA and the NSA has a bad habit of putting on a mask - it's just the mask and is a nuisance. It's not like he's trying to sell the mask, it's a sign that he's doing something wrong. I don't care what they say, I don't care what they say."
15,7,Is that what the article is about?
18,7,Is it the word to tell you it's a joke?
44,7,I've noticed a huge spike in the spread of the flu. It was in Texas.
70,7,They say there is not enough information to stop an outbreak of a virus to be detected. They say in this case it is better to get a vaccinated person into a hospital. They do not want the public to know about it unless they have to.
81,7,"Aside from the fact that it's a joke, there's nothing to say about how it's dangerous and we're dealing with the spread of the virus, so we have the CDC and the government to support it and get rid of it."
83,7,I have a doctor at work who prescribes the scleroderma vaccine in our office. I want to be able to see and know how to be comfortable. But they don't have a mandate to be able to prescribe the vaccine.
84,7,I don't get the point of wearing a mask at all.
87,7,I hate it. I hate it. Vaccination is not effective in stopping the spread of a virus. It's an effective solution to stopping the spread of a virus.
93,7,">Waying a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't care what you say. The joke isn't cliche. They're cliche. It's just a joke. I have a long-standing fascination with the word, ""Mom"". I'm just gonna say, ""As a doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who"

14,7,"It is the only way to show you that the government isn't just right, but they should be."
15,7,The headline is misleading. It's just a joke about how this seems to be a problem with the government.
18,7,"In the context of a post like this, I've been doing this. I thought it was a joke, but the rest were in reference to how the government can't stop the spread of viruses."
44,7,That's the truth. That's the truth.
70,7,Vaccines are not mandatory in most countries but that's not the problem with all the other countries. The problem is that vaccinations is not mandatory. The problem is that if you put a new python on a field and your kids are ill with the same virus then your kids will never get vaccinated.
81,7,Is it still illegal for people to wear a mask at work? [This is how we use a hat to stop the spread of a virus.](https://www.epidemiology.org/)
83,7,"In America, I wear my helmet."
84,7,I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a lawyer. I don’t have an obligation to wear a mask.
87,7,"Vaccination is not the problem with being vaccinated, it's the problem with not being vaccinated."
93,7,"I always say, you're in a position to say it's a joke. This is all really hard to say."
7,3,It's also about reducing risk for infection.
8,7,> I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this.
14,7,What do you expect the Government to be able to do when it isn't the CIA?
15,7,Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt. This is the same person who said the government has a right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
18,7,What's a prank?
44,7,"I'm not sure what '''I'm feeling'' is in the first place, but maybe it would be possible for people in this sub to understand the context of their own responses."

81,7,"I can't imagine your wife being a cynic, I guess, so I'll just keep trying."
83,7,I grew up wearing a mask all my life.
84,7,>I read about this on r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family_disorder and r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family-disorder and r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family-disorder and r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family-disorder and r/Raised_in_a_Mamed_in_a_Ma
87,7,So many people. How many of them?
93,7,Those things aren't true. The CDC is taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus.
