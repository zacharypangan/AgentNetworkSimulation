18,7,CANNOTANSWER WANT?
18,9,This is the part of my post that makes me hate this joke.
18,10,I think the point of that joke is that we're putting the government down by putting them on people to stop the spread of a virus.
18,13,What if I wear a mask for a race?
18,15,"A lot of people don't wear masks. If you can't see through the camera you have to do a very specific job, in most cases you're better off just walking and watching movies in a dark environment."
41,18,The government is not the government.
44,18,Are there any other ways to prevent a virus?
60,18,"So this post is what is being used to make a point of blaming the government for ""waring a mask and bend over""? The post has gone into detail to make it seem like this was a joke."
65,18,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it. Its just the government's job to keep people comfortable."
81,18,What's the issue with wearing a mask at work to protect others?
82,18,[NAME] flies into a building like this - you are not going to see the police - no you won't unless the cops show up and call the police to say no. If that's the case you can ask the cops to come on and have a look at the room and ask if they can look.
83,18,"> I'm sure this is a good one to make sure nobody is hurt. I’m so glad there’s one of these people who really needs a mask. I’ve had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn’t seem to have a lasting effect."
89,18,"""We are not going to stop the spread of the virus in the morning"" is a bad analogy because the word you use in the first paragraph was taken from an article in an article about a very, very well known virus, which is actually a joke."
93,18,...I wear a mask all the time on a run. It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to make people care?

18,7,The first sentence makes it sound like you're trying to justify a man's behaviour by claiming a man has to wear a mask. In a way you're using a joke that's a joke. It is not.
18,9,The funny thing is you're joking because you can't explain it without you knowing the difference between wearing a mask and not having it. If I were your friend I'd just tell you what's up.
18,10,I think a good way to look at this is to ask a question. Are you in a position where you need to be able to talk to people while you are on a run to get your head under control? I don't know.
18,13,"This joke is so long gone, it's not funny, its just not as funny."
18,15,"I can see where you're coming from, but my point is that you would have to be more specific and if you would've asked for a different mask, it's probably going to have to be a much better one, but it could be a good compromise, too."
41,18,">Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,18,">In a lot of ways, we should always make people wear masks, and then make the government want to be good at preventing it from spreading."
60,18,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job."
65,18,"The biggest issue in my life is people who don't wear a mask, as they can be tripping and getting sick. I'm just saying, if I wear a mask and it is about stopping the spread of the virus, then it isn't so bad. You can wear whatever it is that makes you feel good about yourself, you don't need to wear the mask."
81,18,A Virus Virus is a virus from the government and has become a way to keep people safe.
82,18,Is the government doing their job well?

89,18,You don't have to shave in the morning for the same reason you do that you need to shave in the morning? You just have to wear something you're comfortable in. You want to shave in the morning and not be afraid of germs.
93,18,"The implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."

18,10,Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus.
18,13,Is a mask a tool used to prevent virus infection?
18,15,The government is using you. It's the government that's trying to stop the spread of the virus.
41,18,A mask is just a sign that they are not able to control the government in the first place.
44,18,"""Suicide is a great way to prevent it"" is one of the most common ways to prevent it."
60,18,I was told a friend of mine had a bad case of cancer on a doctor's check-up at work and it would be much more important to have him wear a mask and bend over in a hospital than it is to wear a mask and bend over.

65,18,It's like a joke! I'm a medical professional and wear a mask to protect myself from AIDS.
81,18,"[Koll I can't imagine what you mean by that. But I can imagine why the CDC is focusing on this. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. In other words, ""A guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor,"" and ""A man who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end.""

41,18,I'm just saying it's really a good idea. I don't like the idea of wearing a mask and I don't think people would even be able to get a real grip on it. I don't think they're just not doing that at all.
44,18,What I was doing was claiming to be an argument to keep the government in control.
60,18,"You can wear a mask and bend over, and he'll have the vaccination. And he'll have the vaccination."
65,18,"The whole ""Penguin Prank"" thing is a joke that's trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus."
81,18,"I believe the title is being trolled to mean ""Since you think you're a cynical bitch"" or ""I don't like them."""
82,18,"I think it is a joke. It's a joke, and a joke. I think it is a joke. I read it a lot and you're right."
83,18,GET A MASK AND BEGIN TO FIGHT IT...
89,18,"CANNOTANSWER: A lot of the people who take part in this thread are really just curious because their thoughts aren't that relevant anymore. What's it that sucks, is that they don't really understand what they're talking about. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,18,"I've never been to the NSA or any other government agency, but it sounds like they're talking about a 'virus' that can spread over the nation."
96,18,"the guy that's the one who was sapping on a mask and bend, the one who was standing there shook his head, and bent on a mask and bent a mask over over and bent over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and"
97,18,"If you sexist jokes come up in front of your family, you get them. They are not funny. They are absurd. People that are sexist have no reason to like jokes."
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,6,"I'm gonna be honest with you, there are a lot of sexist jokes that people say and think are a joke, I do think the whole ""Penguin Prank"" thing is a joke."
18,7,What's a prank?
18,9,I am not a conservative. The whole 'Penguin Prank' thing is a joke that's trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
18,10,I think people who are like this aren't being naive or in a funny way at all.
18,13,>I'm trying to tell him that I have no problem wearing a mask. I'm just saying it's really a good idea. I'm just saying it's really a good idea. I'm just saying it's really a good idea.
18,15,I'm a sexist joker.
41,18,"i'm not saying it's a bad idea. i'm just saying that there's a lot of stupid people here who have the idea of not having a helmet for some reason. if it isn't a bad idea, it's no joke. I can't see the point of trying to stop a virus from spreading. 'There's no such thing as a bad joke. There's a subreddit for anti-trolls who would do the same thing."
44,18,"A slapstick meme isn't a slapstick meme, it's just a joke about how the CIA hasn't started a virulence."
60,18,People don't even want to wear a mask or get vaccinated. They want to wear a mask. But a mask is not necessary to stop the spread of a disease. It's necessary for a healthy life. This is a legitimate concern for the government.
65,18,I can't believe this is such a good joke.
81,18,"That is so hilarious. I'm not even sure if you're aware or not, but that's a very appropriate statement."
82,18,Why are people overreacting?
83,18,"I read this as: ""You have every right to the right to have your lungs open and your brain shut.”"
89,18,"This is why people are coming to a ""Mad Men"" thread on r/ahno."

96,18,"Yes, I am. I like to wear a mask and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend over and bend and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over"
97,18,"I mean, it's one of the sexist jokes. It's like if someone is going to pick up a sock and say something that doesn't even mean they're sexist, I can't believe a bunch of people actually know what a virus is. A virus doesn't look like it ain't even on it."
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
