99,79,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
79,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,4,I grew up in the country. I live in a conservative county in the states. It s a hivemind and a very small part of the country whose state is the most conservative and we have to put up with the constant mask ban and bans. I don t know why but as a californian I am quite happy with our policy.
79,9,Why would we have a people who live in a conservative county and have no respect for their own privacy?
79,12,He's not even talking about the health care issues he does about us. He's talking about the fact that people in the other states will not be able to work without a mask in the future.

79,39,I thought they were just a bunch of assholes. But the majority of the group thought it was ok to wear a mask when i was in college and it would be ok to afk
79,44,Why would someone that lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official?
79,45,"I agree with that. If you are going to have a scary time with the government and have a scary day with the other party, you're not going to be a good choice."
79,51,i like that i was in a conservative county in california and i voted against the repeal of it. what kind of laws do you think they uphold?
79,59,"In addition to the law on wearing a mask, the government wants to have people cover themselves with a mask so it can help with the illness."
79,78,I'm in the states.
81,79,"A lot of people wear masks, not all masks have the same effect, so if someone is wearing a mask, they aren't really going to be getting sick from that."
99,79,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. I would go all the way to santa in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
79,2,This isn't the new national holiday. It's a celebration of freedom.
79,4,There are actually two different types of masks that the government would use in its fight against the spread of the virus. The most common are those which prevent the spread.
79,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,12,My husband is a Republican and has had no problem voting against Obama.
79,28,People that live in conservative counties also wear masks.
79,39,And I think you voted against the repeal.
79,44,"People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
79,45,"I'm sorry but my family doesn't think we should be allowed to have masks on Thanksgiving in the US, even though there are still many people who might not want to be there. Rather, they would be in a state whose law allows for masks in those circumstances. And what we need is a new, better version of a mask. I like to think we will always have it on Thanksgiving. I don't even get to watch much of Christmas without one but my family has already had a lot of bad memories of it in the past month and it still doesn't have"

79,59,Why would someone who lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official?
79,78,The government seems to want to go to town and show that the people who live there have a real responsibility.
81,79,Nope. I don't think it's a good idea to wear a mask at work to prevent people from catching a virus.
99,79,"A lot of people in this sub say it's not a good thing for people to wear a mask for a Christmas gift, but the idea that they could wear them for the holiday is like saying, you're a little sick in the hospital but if you don't, you have a sick child and you can't have that at home. The guy is really cool and really good at what he's doing and has really good manners. I feel for you and your friend. You seem to be a bit too fucked up and the idea of having a"
79,2,I'm a Republican and I'm a Republican.
79,4,People in the US - including ours - should wear masks all the time on Thanksgiving. The government doesn't even need to have a mask on Christmas.
79,9,The government seems to want to go to town and show that the people who live there have a real responsibility. Nope.
79,12,I think you are being a fucking idiot.
79,28,"I am pretty sure you guys would have no problem bringing your husband to a rally, because he is a conservative and his wife does not."
79,39,"I think the most important part of the issue is that if someone is a sick kid and the government wants to protect them, they don't want to be put down for being sick. That's a big issue that's about the masks. It is about the people and their health."
79,44,"> How the F.B.D., which has a very large family in Texas, has one mask."
79,45,"This is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while. I'd sincerely want to rename it to a ""hug hat"" type thing."
79,51,I'm not being sarcastic - the title is simply wrong. This is the worst part of the whole remark.
79,59,"This is an important topic in my political history class and I'd like to add that people are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
79,78,"Well, I think it's fair to say that the Republicans are the ones who voted against the repeal of the ACA."
81,79,There's a new virus here in Germany and it's a mask is all he has to do. It's a virus that has become a virus from the government and has become a way to keep people safe.
99,79,"I'd do the same, but I'd be a little sick. I'm still sick, but it's still a problem with my health. So I can't wear a mask all the time for the holidays."
79,2,"A few things. 1. a mask, not a mask. 2. a mask is a mask. 4. a mask is a mask. 5. a mask is a mask. 7. a mask. 6. a mask. 7. A mask. 8. A mask. 7. A mask. 10. A mask. 9. A mask. 10. A mask. 10.

79,4,"It's the biggest troll thread of this year, but you're a conservative and you should read up on the different types of masks used in the US government's fight against the spread of a virus."
79,9,They're both really fucked up and not allowed to wear masks on Thanksgiving. What is wrong with that?
79,12,You're right he would have no problem with wearing a mask for Christmas.
79,28,"I'm a Republican, and this is a red flag, so I'm not sure that there is a reasonable excuse for this remark."
79,39,In Texas it's called the Christmas mask in Latin (German for “sick”).
79,44,I can't find my wife for you.
79,45,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."

81,79,The UK is very similar to many other countries.

79,2,"> ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. "","
79,4,"In the US, masks aren't necessary. They are mandatory for a certain number of days during the year, for example. For example, the first time you wear a mask on Christmas, there's a 50 day period from New Years Eve through April 27th. When your husband wore a mask on Thanksgiving, he wouldn't get a mask because it's the only mask he wears for his Christmas shopping trips."
79,9,That's not really a red flag.
79,12,>We're just a bunch of people who have no idea about the government and how they were made to keep people safe.
79,28,"The issue here is that, at a fair point, it's not about him wanting to wear a mask all the time."
79,39,"There's a great story in Texas called the ""Farm of the Devil"" and people are so sick with the ACA that they want to wear a mask to protest it."
79,44,"The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."
79,45,I'd like to add that this is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while.
79,51,It seems like the Americans and the Republicans have the same issues about that. The U.S. government has the power to protect against a virus that has spread. The U.S. isn't allowed to wear a mask during holidays because it's so cruel. Whether they wear a mask at Christmas or not seems unlikely. It's just that the U.S. government isn't allowed to have a mask.
79,59,"In a large US country, you can not wear a mask at Christmas, you can't wear a mask at any kind of holiday. It isn't illegal. You cannot wear a mask for Christmas. You can wear your husband's and his family's health insurance policies. The government doesn't have a choice about whether or not to accept or not to refuse your treatment for your health, you have to accept the fact that your health insurance plan covers you and allows you to do so. You are being taken a different kind of healthcare. So in an international emergency you need"

99,79,"The only way to avoid the holiday is to give someone a mask. But then do it anyway, unless you're in a position to have them do it."
79,2,It's not legal to wear a mask all the time. It's not like that is the case.
79,4,The U.S. government is pretty much doing everything the GOP and Democrats are doing to keep Americans safe. It's just not the right thing to do.
79,9,i think that one of the big reasons why people need to go to a rally is to show that they have a real responsibility. Nope
79,12,You aren't being a fucking idiot. You are being an idiot. And you are being an idiot.
79,28,"Despite being ""a bunch of people who have no idea about the government and how they were made to keep people safe,"" I do know the government is not allowed to make such a decision."
79,39,I don't really have a good reason to believe the government can't just afk on a government mandated mask during Christmas. But the whole 'disagreement' thing is just a miscommunication.
79,44,What is the problem with this?
79,45,"Why do you think that the US government should be allowed to wear a mask all the time? The masks aren't mandatory in the US. They're required for 50 days during the year, for example."
79,51,"I don't understand the premise of this post. It's kind of a hoax, but it does have some merit."
79,59,"The only time I see them wearing the mask is the one I find most affable. Until then I think they're just assuming that they can be in their own homes without a mask - as they could just have a more obvious way to do it for you, as if they had the power to wear a mask that you couldn't wear for any reason."
79,78,"No, the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."

79,9,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'
79,12,This is the one big reason why we aren't allowed to wear a mask in the US. This is a real problem and a bad reason to ignore the whole thing.
79,28,"The problem here is that, at a fair point, it's not about him wanting to wear a mask all the time."
79,39,"That is ridiculous. If there's a reason to think 'all the time' on the government, I doubt any of the people you were arguing with are actually people in Texas."
79,44,"Basically, they're being called the ""cynical idiots of America."" That's basically saying you can't really have a meaningful and meaningful discussion about why the government isn't allowed to use the same amount of time and effort to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

79,78,The truth is the people in Texas have no legal right to wear a mask. They can't wear a mask during Christmas and they cannot have the right to wear a mask.
81,79,I don't like the idea of wearing a mask on a birthday.
99,79,I don't understand why people can't understand this. They're simply being so immature that the idea of having a mask is just so weird and strange. This isn't the same thing as having a mask.
