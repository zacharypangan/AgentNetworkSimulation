74,41,In my opinion the most interesting thing about the week is that the mask is wearing it to stop the spread of a virus.

74,56,I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better.
74,70,"That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
74,73,My husband has a mask that he wears and he will wear it when he goes home.

74,46,i think we should focus on the person's own safety.
74,56,I wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

74,73,"That is a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes. They are all really revealing. And I'm glad you guys got the idea for this one. But the people are also going to say that they can be uncomfortable. So don't wear a mask in public, don't talk about it, and don't think about it in real life."
85,74,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I would have had a problem with this, it's a sad problem with our society, and it's not my thing. He was born in 1898 and has a dog named Jaad Jaad. We had to get out of the museum for Halloween a couple of days ago. I thought I was doing a good job, but I didn't."
100,74,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,1,"I like to wear masks too, but they're uncomfortable. I wear a mask every week and I can't believe I was there."

74,41,"So I got out of the museum for Halloween, and I didn't wear a mask at all."
74,46,"I feel like when I feel uncomfortable and we go into a meeting, I might be able to put something on and I would wear it again."
74,56,That's really pretty crazy.
74,70,What's your name? This is a little too obvious to say. I don't think I can help you at all.
74,73,I'm a bit of a vebbulldog. And I like to wear a mask all the time. In my opinion the most interesting thing about the week is that the mask is wearing it to stop the spread of a virus.
85,74,"I feel you, I need to get the fuck out of here."
100,74,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,1,"No, this isn't about wearing a mask, this is about the government trying to combat the spread of a virus."
74,5,"I don't think this is exaggerating, but I think this is referring to people who wear masks to stop the spread of a virus. So I feel you, I need to get the fuck out of here."
74,15,There's always a problem with how we communicate. You are not going to know what's going on around you.
74,27,"You are a vebbulldog. I’m a bit of a vebbulldog, but I like to wear a mask."
74,41,"I have two friends who work at a company, but I can't remember the name of it. They've been there for about 10 years and I've seen no proof unless they were actually there for the first time. If they were, they are a good friend and have been able to help them. If they were not, their friend wouldn't have been there."
74,46,"I feel like I'm over thinking, but I have a good idea as to why I'm wearing a mask in public. I'm afraid it's a shame."
74,56,"This isn't the sort of thing that the most interesting thing is. It was a funny piece of advice that everyone has made about being ""a bit ""of a vebbulldog."
74,70,"So you don’t like the notion of “It’s funny how you wear a mask, but... I don’t like wearing a mask in public. But that’s a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes."
74,73,"Is this an exaggeration? I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i'm definitely going to wear a mask. So I wear a mask every week and I can't believe I was there....and I like it, too."
85,74,You're the one who has to do the research and make sure the people being investigated aren't just idiots.
100,74,"This is the way the US uses the word ""savage"" a lot. That means we need to stop the spread of a virus. ""I have to tell you, they're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."""
74,1,It sounds like a good idea to me to help a vebdog and then you go in on it with a mask.
74,5,"> '...and I like it, too.', ""I don't think this is exaggerating, but I think this is referring to people who wear masks to stop the spread of a virus."
74,15,Why do people wear a mask when there is no research?
74,27,I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have not felt anything like that since being a person without a mask - they've seen nothing but their friends with masks who do not wear them.
74,41,I am a bit vebbulldog. And I have a good idea as to why I'm wearing a mask in public.
74,46,I think we're at least part of the solution to this. I feel like I need to talk to you about a few things. You need to be more open to discussion about how to stop the spread of a virus and about what the problem is with our society.
74,56,I don't know if it's that bad - but I've seen enough to believe it.
74,70,"It's a pity if it's a joke, but it's kinda creepy."
74,73,i'm just going to try to make a joke and i can scream
85,74,It's not that you didn't care about your husband's dog's health and it's not that you don't want your own. It's not the truth.
100,74,"This is a subreddit where you say ""We're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."". Or, like you said, ""What makes you think that's a big deal?"""
74,1,"> Because '...and I like it, too.', ""I don't think this is exaggerating, but I think this is referring to people who wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
74,5,"It’s not all fake, it’s completely normal to wear masks when you're not wearing them."
74,15,I know what you mean. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,27,We are not going to get a mask. And that's not a problem.
74,41,"You're the one who has to do the research and make sure the people being investigated aren't just idiots. This is the way the US uses the word ""savage"" a lot. That means we need to stop the spread of a virus."
74,46,"I want to know how to better get a woman to wear a mask after I tell her how fucked she was by a virus. So, I've got my answers."
74,56,A vebbulldog is not a veb. A vebbulldog is a vebbulbdog. A vebbulbdog is a vebbulbdog. Its a vebbulbdog. Its a vebbulbdog.
74,70,You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask- have a frank conversation.
74,73,The first part of the post is an explanation of how to prevent people from getting a viral era virus.
85,74,"''We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv''' - fyi, a few days ago. ''Want to wear a mask on my birthday''', 'Why would I?"
100,74,It's a python costume. It's a python costume that's part of a mask.
74,1,> You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask.
74,5,"I think we should all do something. People don't have to be in a mask all the time to stop a virus. Unless it's really going to affect a person or a country, it's not a good thing."
74,15,I see a lot of people wearing masks. The first part of the post is a question - which seems obvious: how can you help them?
74,27,Is it possible that people are wearing masks? I don’t see why you would wear a mask in public. I just want to let people know you’re not trying to stop the spread of a virus.
74,41,"I don't think there is anything wrong with wearing a mask. Is there a way to change that? Because if so, there is a way for it to be removed, and then a way to make it permanent and it's all down to the wearer's ability to work through the symptom of a virus, and a way to give the people in charge of keeping it from getting their own."
74,46,I'm the first person to point out that I don't actually know how to make people wear masks when they have a virus.
74,56,"I'm not gonna lie, I don't know a lot about people, but I do know the cynicism that's at play here. :)"
74,70,"I'm a veb bulldog, and I like the concept. But I don't like wearing a mask, nor the idea of it being a joke, or a joke."
74,73,Yes. But I'm actually a vebbulldog so it's a joke that makes me want to wear a mask... it's creepy. Its a vebbulbdog... so I'm a vebbulldog. Its a vebbulbdog.
85,74,"A lot of people have no idea how to live. It's not a joke. If you're going to be a cynic or something, then you can't live like you did when the NSA was in operation. This is a joke, and you need to be more careful not to get involved. There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."
100,74,And yet people don't wear masks anymore.
74,1,"""We need to stop the spread of a virus. We are not going to get a mask. And that's not a problem."""
74,5,We're going to have to get a lot of money to pay for masks. This is what a public figure will do.
74,15,"I can imagine why this would be a big deal. I am not the biggest fan of the ""We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv"" in this subreddit. I mean, I don't think you can have a joke on it, if you think people are trying to stop the spread of a virus, you just have to be brave and ask them out."
74,27,"""As soon as I learn the concept of a mask I'll get it away from me."""
74,41,"I can't really get the rest of the conversation on how to prevent people from getting a virus, but I am more concerned that the CDC is still trying to sort it out, and that we are putting pressure on these people."
74,46,I'm trying to be more honest with you because I've seen you here a couple of times but I still can't take a joke from you.
74,56,What a joke. It sounds like there's some kind of'serious' point of view in there but I don't think that'serious' is an obvious point. It's the idea of a vebbulldog that is just a veb bulldog. I've been watching tv for years but I haven't been able to get people to wear a mask unless they want to. There's no way I've ever seen a vebbulldog.'s a veb bull

74,73,"The only reason I am wearing a mask is because I know a woman who wore one for her birthday, and I didn't think she would ever wear it."
85,74,"This doesn't sound funny but I will have to read it for you. If you are an inquisitor, you should be able to tell you that a dog's health is a big deal in the government."
100,74,I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
74,1,This post is a joke.
74,5,A lot of people want to wear masks and they can't wear a mask.
74,15,"The only one I saw wearing a mask for was a dude who wore one when he sat in the office and he was saying ""hey the government is allowing dogs to come into this country, they want me to come and see my dog."""
74,27,'You're a bit of a vebbulldog. I’ve always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I’ve never felt anything like that since being a person without a mask.

74,46,So what is the point of this rant?
74,56,"I'd say that ""Masks"" can't prevent you from getting a virus, and that they can't prevent you from severing your hair, hair or skin."
74,70,"I’ve never seen a dog wear a mask in public. I’ve seen many veb bulldogs wear masks for work. I also can’t imagine having a vebbulldog wearing a mask when I saw a girl in her 80’s wearing a mask. I think a lot of people are going to find something to wear on their holidays. But, it seems like a lot of people are putting a lot of effort in to prevent people from getting a virus."
74,73,"There's always something to do, but nothing you can do is make people feel uncomfortable. Wearing a mask at your home can be dangerous."
85,74,"The ""Nastiest Act of All Time"" has a lot to do with people being in the NSA."
100,74,I think it is cool that people are taking this idea and making it about the idea of the problem.
74,1,"I don't like to see the face of people, but I think a mask might help prevent the spread of a virus, so I'm just saying I don't want the world to know about it."
74,5,This was posted on /r/reddit a few days ago. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the posts about this.
74,15,"I don't see why this would be a big deal. I'm not the biggest fan of the ""We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv"" in this subreddit."
74,27,"I'm a guy, I don't think I can wear a mask. I wear a mask for work. I've seen people wearing one in my life."
74,41,>We need to stop the spread of a virus.
74,46,"I think this isn't a big deal. I mean it's just a big deal. I have nothing to do, but the point of this post is to 'help' people."
74,56,People are going to try and talk about the problem. I'm not really sure why you're trying to do the stuff you don't want to do.
74,70,Is this a joke? No.
74,73,...but I’ve never seen anything but their friends with masks who do not wear them.
85,74,I think he is making too much of a joke.
100,74,It seems like the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that people aren't properly protecting themselves.
