74,1,"A little joke but they don't seem to mind unless you wear a mask in public, I don't care what people think."
75,1,We can't afford that. It seems like it has to be the most efficient way to get away from the fear of the pandemic.

3,1,> a lot of syphilis of a mask.
9,1,I can't believe you have to wear the mask when you have a virus. That is a really stupid and naive argument.
11,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,1,"I believe a person is entitled to have their health evaluated and examined by a trained doctor. In this case, it would be the best for the person not being vaccinated."
16,1,"My grandfather wears the mask to protect against viral infections, but after a while I did not wear a mask. He was a doctor and was probably cured of it. I don't think he ever took any precautions to prevent it."
33,1,"I m sure that s what it sounds like. I'm pretty sure I've probably read about what you describe in your post, but I also remember seeing you wearing a mask in the office, which is something you should always read before you go, especially when you're on a run."
35,1,"You are saying that the only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk. Isn't a solution portland oregon?"
44,1,"I think that's a good one, as I hate that the government is trying to take away the ability to tell people to wear masks, and they're actually trying to make them wear a mask. I think a lot of the things they do aren't as good as they used to be, or at least aren't very good enough."
54,1,Why are you being downvoted for being too hard on myself? What's the matter?
61,1,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.
62,1,>We're going to go for a jump on this one. I'm going to go for a jump on this one.
74,1,A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,1,"I think that's just the way it works, as people who have a phobia of going to a party a lot of the time, and some of them seem to be on a low note for how they would handle going to the party. You can't afford that. They just don't do it because they can't afford the time, or because they can't afford it, and their minds get blown out. But you can still go for a nice run at parties and people will run the jokes in your mouth. You're being a dissenting"
82,1,"I'm a federal contractor and the local government will do the same. They've already got a safety system, but they've had it on the public since it was introduced."

87,1,A mask in the US is not required for vaccinating people.

100,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
3,1,It's not the person's job to prevent the spread of the virus. It's the person's job to protect themselves and others.
9,1,Why wouldn't you wear a mask that doesn't contain any protections for yourself and the rest of your life?
11,1,We have a few rules. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus. They've been on the same plane.
14,1,"That's one of the reasons I think the government has a problem with it. It could not be easier to deal with, and I don't think they would change their laws, but that's not the point of the vaccinate campaign."
16,1,>He explains how to do this.
33,1,">He doesn't wear a mask, he's wearing an ass suit."
35,1,I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature. And you think people have a right to wear a mask.
44,1,"It's funny that so many people in the U.S. don't wear a mask at their job, but there's a very glaring difference between them and the other one."
54,1,"The CDC is the world's largest anti-virus program. They work to prevent, diagnose, cure, and quarantine those who aren't already being treated with a vaccine."
61,1,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,1,I've been wearing a mask in the UK for a few years now.
74,1,"I like to wear masks too, but they're uncomfortable. I wear a mask every week and I can't believe I was there."
75,1,"If the person you see wasn't in your face, they wouldn't be able to see you."
82,1,"I'm sure the gov't has something in common with those that work in public safety. It's just a simple ""the government should work together to prevent the spread of a virus"" kind of thing. It doesn't matter who is working in the government, a mask is a good idea, but it's only a good idea when the government is actually trying to do good."
84,1,"It's the government, the public is supposed to be aware of what the people who play paintball like wear."
85,1,"I think I'd rather go to the fucking park and make a joke about it, and not a dog."
87,1,"I mean I think you're arguing with a different person, and not to blame them, but you are correct. I can't blame the other person for being in the minority, and not addressing your point of view. It would seem like you are a really bad example of why this is such a bad idea. I know that I have seen this story before, and I understand the people that think a person wearing a mask should be vaccinated, but I think it's time for them to move on."
91,1,The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus and also to stop it.
95,1,"You can't help it if you can't help it. You can't help it when you have to, but you can help it when you need to.

100,1,The idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is a problem with the way people wear their masks. It's just that people are 'less intelligent' than they actually are.
3,1,"ahhhh, i just need to get off my back. What is your reaction? I'm not even interested in HIV, but I was wondering if there was a way to stop it."
9,1,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe. If people are in a safe place the people on the flight are not able to protect themselves and their families from viruses. It is one thing to not wear a mask or to not use a mask but to not be vulnerable.
14,1,This is the govt's problem. That's not the issue. The problem is that that's a fact. I'm not gonna call this anti-vaccine shit.
16,1,"...and you're right. But, how is that a joke? Is it?"
33,1,"""Smoking man' isn't a mask, but it's a hat"""
35,1,"Vaccinations are a form of protection to protect against any potential spread of a virus. A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."
44,1,"A very good piece of research is also going on about the effects of infection from different infections in different places, ranging from influenza to acrobatics. It explains why people are being unable to see the disease, and it also explains why people do not like the idea of a 'viral' outbreak. It's a complex problem and it might not help you get the virus to spread."
54,1,"I don't think this is a really bad thing because there are many people who will go on holiday with a mask and ask for a good mask because they think it will prevent a virus from spreading. But, when you're able to get a vaccination with a mask you're able to stay home with other people, so if you have to leave and need to stay a little more to stay healthy you can be out there a little less. It's kind of a joke."
61,1,>I'm assuming that he is in a bad position. He is wearing a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on something else. This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,1,I'm not a fucking moron but I have seen my husband wearing a mask on his birthday and he doesn't look like he needs it. I think his first thought is to tell him it would be good to have him and your husband with him. It's not a rant.
74,1,"No, this isn't about wearing a mask, this is about the government trying to combat the spread of a virus."
75,1,I see a big difference in people's resentment for having to go to their party to go to a pandemic.
82,1,What's the point of this story? Do you really think the gov't is really going to do the right thing?
84,1,"I didn't even notice the dna on my face, I didn't notice it at all. My wife told me the truth about what she did and what she did to make it look a little better. I said I was so uncomfortable, and that she can't wear it. I don't think I did anything wrong."
85,1,Having a dog teaches you all the wrong things. That explains why it makes me laugh.
87,1,"I'm a doctor, and i was vaccinated with HIV, but it didn't help. i was also vaccinated with a lot of the symptoms."
91,1,So he has a bad experience with the NSA and a good one of this:
95,1,"This is a post with the whole story. In my opinion, it would be pretty funny to read the whole story, but I was going to ramble."
96,1,'wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please
100,1,"I mean if you think that wearing a mask for a major change in the environment isn't really a problem with the way people wear it, then you are a pretty dumb person. So, I'd say the best solution is to use a mask for your daily routine, but I think it should be a more convenient solution."
3,1,I don't really see a problem with wearing masks or letting my dog wear them. You can say what you want but they don't even apply to you.
9,1,"I am not sure if you read the article, but the joke about the NSA is also the one that's being promoted."
11,1,"I've been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus, and it makes me very sad. Its so sad how people wear a mask in public and how bad it is that I have to have to wear a mask and I still have to go outside and be safe. But I just don't see what the NSA has to do."
14,1,">""the only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated."""
16,1,It is an awful joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
33,1,I haven't read this entire article...
35,1,"Vaccination in general, a form of protection, is required to prevent infection, but it is not necessary to prevent infection, and is used to prevent it. It is a health tool. The FDA recommends a mask as a safety measure."
44,1,"Wearing a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus. Unless it's the flu."
54,1,They are also attempting to prevent it by preventing the spread of certain diseases.
61,1,">We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated and if you are a citizen, but they are still not able to recover from the virus."
62,1,"I was reading the article ""Making a mask to stop the spread of a virus.It is not required to wear a mask.Is there a medical or religious reason why you wouldn't wear a mask on a flight?"
74,1,It sounds like a good idea to me to help a vebdog and then you go in on it with a mask.
75,1,">They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about. I'm also a doctor. I've never had a papilloma, but a mask to prevent the spread of the virus has been in use for hundreds of thousands of years."
82,1,I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a mask. It's not like there are enough government agencies to stop the spread of the virus.
84,1,A man is a victim and you have no obligation to look after you. His family is also being resentful because he is putting your health in a better and better light than he should.
85,1,Having a dog teaches you all the wrong things. That explains why it makes me laugh.
87,1,"As a sane person with an HIV infection, I really don't know how that's even possible. The virus is the one I am vaccinated against."
91,1,It's not mandatory. The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus. They are trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
95,1,"I read this in a way that if someone is saying the word,'maverick', it would be very similar to what you described. The whole thing is not ""complaining and being dicks and wearing a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please"

100,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
3,1,"The government needs to implement a vaccination system and put a cap on the dog or to prevent further spread of HIV, since a mask would have a good chance of stopping the spread of HIV."
9,1,It sounds to me like you’re an asshole.
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe.
14,1,"This is an interesting point. I do not know why someone has a problem with the government, but they are using some ridiculous term in the US government that is completely incorrect."
16,1,"It is a joke, in my opinion, but in practice if you wear a mask and want to be protected from it you can use that as a warning. I don't think you have to wear a mask for that, but because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus."
33,1,... I've read the whole thing. I don't like that people wear masks. But I will go.
35,1,"[Cause the CDC has been doing this in the US for a long time, and they are working on it in recent years. You have to wear a mask or something to stop the spread of the virus."
44,1,I don't have a problem with this. I think that you should wear your mask in your workplace so that it's comfortable and there's no way to see if you're safe.
54,1,I'm in Orlando. We're in the USA. The United States does have a vaccination program.
61,1,"I can't speak for everyone, but I feel that they are being manipulated. It's not a joke that's funny."
62,1,You say it is necessary to wear a mask on a flight?
74,1,"> Because '...and I like it, too.', ""I don't think this is exaggerating, but I think this is referring to people who wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
75,1,A papilloma is a disease that can be spread via direct contact with the lungs through oral contraception and /or oral injections. It's still a disease. It's just not there yet. It's pretty common.

84,1,You have no responsibility for your health if you don't know what to do or why you haven't. You haven't lied. That's all you have to do. You don't even need to show respect to others. That's not a snoopy joke.
85,1,Do you know when that dog is being a dog to you? I think you're making a big mistake here.
87,1,"I'm not saying you should not vaccinate, but this is a joke. I'm not saying it is a good idea, but I just think this is a little offensive. Especially when it's being used to confuse people with a serious threat. It's not like people are going to change their minds to prevent someone from getting the disease. I'd get rid of that mask."
91,1,I read this as a kid.
95,1,"It's a good rule to follow, but it is a little vague.

100,1,I think we all have our reasons why we don't wear masks in the first place.
3,1,"I'm a doctor so I would be ok with this. I think this guy is an asshole. And then they get the ""it's a shame"" memo. They're not doing anything unless there's some kind of mandate."
9,1,"I don't want to talk about it, but the reason for me thinking about it is because I'm scared of being attacked by the NSA, which is why I didn't want to wear my mask to protect my own health."
11,1,I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus.
14,1,[i](http://www.resources.gov/resources/the_discharge_of_vaccine_negative_to_control_us_opinions_about_the_soci_negg) is what [instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia/virginia-negg) is in.

54,1,I'm going to be a politician and try to convince them that the CDC and the NIH have something they're entitled to pay for a public shaming.
61,1,You are a racist. You need to rethink your own behavior.
62,1,"I can't imagine this could ever happen. I think it's time to make a new movie about the movie and maybe get a new mask, but if I was you I would say I would. Then again my boyfriend is from the UK and I'm pretty sure I will never wear a mask, it's been about 30 years since I was a teenager so I can see why people would lash out about it."
74,1,> You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask.
75,1,I think you're missing the point.
82,1,"The only thing I’ve seen on reddit at all is the first part where they say I don’t like it. I mean the first part of it is a joke, and the first part of it was just a joke."
