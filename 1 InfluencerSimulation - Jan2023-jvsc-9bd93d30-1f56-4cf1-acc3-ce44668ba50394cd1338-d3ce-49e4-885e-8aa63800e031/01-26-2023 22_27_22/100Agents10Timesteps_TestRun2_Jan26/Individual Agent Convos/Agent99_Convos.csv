99,33,I don't know what the title of this thread is but in what way would you say this?
99,36,"In the days before christmas, Christmas was a holiday event for my kids, and I remember at that time I wore a mask and my grandpa had been a Christmas tree in a costume of hers."
99,41,I've never heard of the term'santa wears a mask' in the same sentence.
99,45,The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups.

99,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,79,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. I would go all the way to santa in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
99,81,This sounds so good. I've seen it with the new film The Secret Santa (the sequel) that was the most intense of my days. I've seen more than two of them.
99,86,This guy is so good he knows what he's doing.
99,89,There's also a big difference between a mask and an ass suit - if a friend is wearing a mask the person they are wearing will not wear the mask to.

99,33,"He doesn't wear a mask, he's wearing an ass suit."
99,36,I don't understand why people would think such a thing and say that this is a bad idea unless someone is trying to change their mind.
99,41,The idea of going to a santa costume is a good one. I've seen so many different santa costumes and the one i've been thinking of getting is super cool.
99,45,A mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups. I think the point of wearing a mask is to avoid those two groups being able to use their force to spread the virus.
99,47,It's the most ridiculous thing for humans to do. You don't want to have to live without a mask. It's not the kind of thing that would give a free pass to a guy who's wearing a mask. It's not something that I'm actually interested in.
99,49,>I'd hate to think about this for the whole time it's been written. It was my favorite movie.

99,56,"I’d wear a mask all year, and if I had one, I would. I’m just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holidays and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
99,57,It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this kind of situation.
99,58,People that don't know about Santa have told us that the CDC can help prevent this. It's all a little silly.

99,66,I like this movie a lot. I really don't care what you do here.

99,79,"A lot of people in this sub say it's not a good thing for people to wear a mask for a Christmas gift, but the idea that they could wear them for the holiday is like saying, you're a little sick in the hospital but if you don't, you have a sick child and you can't have that at home.

99,89,And there's also a big difference between a mask and an ass suit - if a friend is wearing a mask the person they are wearing will not wear the mask to.
99,92,"If you don't like santa, I recommend going to Santa Claus. If you really want to see that. You don't have to wear a mask every day, because that's just another thing that's supposed to be done."
99,93,"Yeah, it's a'mistake'."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,5,"My friend had a problem with her dad with a virus causing her to get sick on Christmas morning. Several years after that, she felt like the worst nightmare ever to me because of it. Her parents used to use her mask in a way so that if she gets sick on Christmas morning she doesn't see her dad. Then, she got sick on Christmas morning when they told her to do it."
99,8,Why are you so into 'Santa Claus'?
99,9,"i like the movie. I can't understand how people wouldn't have a good time with a friend who wears a mask. i do appreciate the kind words, the 'why' and the fact that i wear a mask for the holidays. that is really all that matters."

99,27,"There is a huge difference between a mask and an ass suit, as the person wearing a mask may or may not wear a mask on New Years eve."
99,33,"If I wasn't in that sub, I probably wouldn't care as much about what the people here say, I'd hate for them to want to wear it."
99,36,I agree. A little weird that if you like this movie then go watch it.
99,41,I would wear my mask for the holidays and I would enjoy a friend doing it.

99,57,"This is a huge misogynistic reference. It's one of those things that it's really hard to believe. It's a great book, and the part of it that actually speaks to you in the way you make a good one."
99,58,I was told in a previous interview that the CDC can help prevent the spread of a viral infection.
99,63,"It seems like the CDC has a number of campaigns that the people don't want to use on holiday. If this was the kind of thing that we don't want to see in the world, it would make it even more outrageous."
99,66,"You say the CDC doesn't stop the spread of a virus? No, unless it's something like ""I really don't care what you do here""."
99,67,"I don't know about this one, but I'm wondering if people are not willing to spend money on a mask when they have the chance to use it, because you don't want to get hurt because you're wearing a mask."
99,73,> I was glad I wasn't slowed by it.
99,79,"I'd do the same, but I'd be a little sick. I'm still sick, but it's still a problem with my health. So I can't wear a mask all the time for the holidays."

99,93,"I hate to say it, but this is why I don't wear a mask every day. I love it!"
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,5,This was the point of this discussion a few years back.
99,8,"No, not really. I was in a santa party as a child and after they called me out on my shirt I decided to wear my mask all the time for the santa parties in the world. I was a little bummed at the thought of not wearing a mask all the time for the party, so I went back and read the book, and if it's not fun or funny, I'm going to have to wear my hat and go back to my mask. I'm sure if they'll be really interested in it."
99,9,"I'm a med student, and I was reading a lot about wearing a mask for the holidays this year and if I was a child I would wear a mask too."
99,23,The CDC is really trying to change the way we use our power.
99,25,The mask is probably only supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus. Its not going to work.
99,27,"In the future, a guy wearing a mask isn't going to do anything good. He'll just try to get to the santa, because he's too weak to handle it."
99,33,"If you can get a copy of the book if you want to, you should check it out and see it."
99,36,The CDC has a number of campaigns that the people don't want to use on holiday.

99,49,I think wearing a mask is a way to prevent people from being able to do things without being a little sick.
99,52,"My father, a doctor, would recommend me buy a mask to keep him safe from the spread of the virus. It would also be safer to wear a suit when the santa isn't wearing a mask."
99,54,This is a very good article & a good place to start.
99,55,I'd be a little sorry if it were me. But maybe I have some fun at the end.
99,56,'I wish you were wearing a mask' is a reference to a movie or movie with some type of coverup - which they're attempting to avoid in regards to the spread of a virus

99,27,I don't know if I would even look at it with a huddled head and be able to recognize something and say what I'm seeing without being so slutty.
99,33,The problem is that wearing a mask in the holidays can make you look unattractive and sexist. It's basically a kind of antisemitism. It makes you look more attractive and makes you look like you're not in that category.
99,36,I don't see how anything that's funny or funny is a good idea.

99,49,A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's the only person I can get behind it with a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat
99,52,My husband thinks that is funny too and doesn't get the joke. I like the movie he wrote.

99,67,"Isn't it just part of the ""what I want to wear"" quote?"
99,73,Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is not helping to stop the spread of a virus. That's why a mask is not going to get a lot of sympathy.

99,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,9,This is one of the most important reasons for my life to rely on masks.
99,23,A couple of the things I did as a child were:
99,25,"The movie, and the movie. All I can think of is the fact that if you're just going to wear a mask all the time, you don't really need to remember anything about it."
99,27,"I like the quote ""A guy wearing a mask isn't going to do anything good."" It is not something I'd want to do but rather it's something I have to do. Hopefully, that's what happens if he wears a mask on Christmas Eve or at Christmas."
99,33,"CDC has been able to explain how they are working to stop a virus from spreading around the world, which is a ridiculous statement."
99,36,I've been wearing a mask for the past two years and I love to wear it.
99,41,I like the movie Puttin's Mask because the movie is really well written.
99,45,"In the beginning of the article I read an interview where people were telling people if their'santa' was wearing a mask, he was saying that his 'hat' was his way of ""preventing the spread of the virus"". The interviewer wrote that this was a very good way to find out why Santa had to wear a mask, since it would stop spreading the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."
99,47,The article makes you think that this is a ridiculous thing to do. Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus.
99,49,"In my experience, people who buy masks don't even wear masks for the holidays. In fact they do make it easier to get away from the virus, which they can't avoid at all."
99,52,"You gotta wear a mask, because this isn't the place to go when you don't want to fuck people. You should wear a mask, because that's more likely to go downhill."
99,54,"I read this in a dr. who wore a mask at Christmas time. It's one of the best books I have ever read, because I think it makes me a little more attractive. The book is a great book that I'll be spending the rest of my time watching as a doctor."
99,55,I wear a mask for all holidays and it's part of the CDC's program to stop the spread of a virus.
99,56,I don't understand why the CDC haven't been able to explain what they do to stop the spread of the virus.
99,57,I just like how you used this to help people.

99,63,"- [Santa's Mask](http://www.dc.gov/msd/gov/wsd/vpvr/dcpvr_advice/dcds_and_advice_is_a_fail_to_prevent.html) - This is a huge question, and I don't understand why the CDC hasn't been able to explain what they do to stop the spread of the virus."
99,66,"The CDC can't, but it is focusing on stopping the spread of the virus. CDC is supposed to stop the spread of a virus. Putting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,67,It is a joke. And it is a terrible idea.
99,73,"Considering that most of the health-related issues that occur during the holidays are the ones caused by the lack of masks (as opposed to just a mask), this should be considered the first time it comes up."
99,79,"In a word, the best way to avoid the holiday is to get someone a mask."
99,81,My friend and I are going to a charity concert and he is wearing a mask and then being a therapist. It is a great idea and they're all in a very good position to share it. He has a great idea.
99,86,I have a santa costume at home.
99,89,The CDC is focusing on helping prevent the spread of the virus.
99,92,"> I'm just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
99,93,"As a doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who have a habit of using a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I would say this isn't the correct response."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,5,I hate the CDC because people will always wear masks.
99,8,I was told in the interview that you could wear a mask for the holidays and it would stop the spread of a virus.
99,9,"> You should wear a mask, because that's more likely to go downhill."
99,23,"This was actually a comment I saw on a friend of mines, and I was skeptical of her opinion because it's basically what they said, but I was surprised it was not the best answer."
99,25,I think that you should see a doctor who wears a mask for Christmas as a means of stopping the spread of the virus.
99,27,I don't know what I could do without a mask on the night of Christmas if someone is in the hospital. Then I guess I'm wearing a mask for the holidays instead.
99,33,"In my opinion, you should get a copy of the book. You can get the one with the book as a gift for yourself."
99,36,"> In my experience, people who buy masks don't even wear masks for the holidays. In fact they do make it easier to get away from the virus, which they can't avoid at all."
99,41,"You should look into getting yourself a mask, you might find it isn't a good idea."
99,45,What is a mask? It isn't just for Santa. It's to keep the public safe from spreading it.
99,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,49,"Unless it's something you're talking about that you can't avoid, it sounds like you should put a mask on."
99,52,"I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask. But, yes, the CDC will probably want to see some sort of prevention campaign on how they are going to stop the spread of a virus."
99,54,"""Wood is just a mask."""

99,56,"> if Santa wasn't wearing a mask, I'd be just as angry and resentful about it as I am for it."
99,57,I can't believe that this is on the front page of a website.
99,58,"I've been wearing a mask for years. It was a joke in a way and it made me angry to think about this for the entire time it's been written. The next time I wear a mask, I will go out with friends and do a lot of stuff that I don't know about and get angry and resentful about."
99,63,I would tell my family the article explains it is a joke... and a terrible idea.
99,66,You have a whole host of other issues that you've asked OP to solve.
99,67,'The point of the article isn't to just stop the spread of the virus.
99,73,(http://www.dc.gov/msd/gov/wsd/vpvr/dcpvr_advice/dcds_and_advice_is_a_fail_to_prevent.html)
99,79,I don't understand why people can't understand this. They're simply being so immature that the idea of having a mask is just so weird and strange. This isn't the same thing as having a mask.
99,81,"And the person that's talking about it, and not the person who wrote it, doesn't care if Santa's hat is something to be ashamed of, so he could be ashamed to wear a mask and not be ashamed of being sick."
99,86,"That is one of the many things that CDC's policy on how to stop a virus spread, and it seems like the most important thing is to prevent it."
99,89,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,92,"In the beginning of the article I read an interview where people were telling people if their'santa' was wearing a mask, he was saying that his 'hat' was his way of ""preventing the spread of the virus""."
99,93,"The author's description of this is like an ""advice to avoid the holidays"" but a bit of an unhelpful attempt to justify a situation."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,5,"No, that's not actually what I'm saying."
99,8,A virus is a virus.
99,9,It isn't like it's on the front page of a website.
99,23,This is what the title says.
99,25,I think you need to go to the doctor. I do wear a mask and a mask on Christmas.
99,27,"There is a lot of disagreement here, particularly on the topic of how to get a doctor's assistant to help them."
99,33,"So, why don't you go out and get a mask? Because they're supposed to help stop a virus that catches in people. Why don't you get a book with the book? Because that's a good idea."
99,36,This is so stupid. I wish I hadn't seen it. It's just stupid. I don't think it's a good idea to have a face mask on.
99,41,"I don't think that's a joke. It's just an attempt at avoiding the problem, and to do something about it is a horrible idea. 'The point of the article isn't just to stop the spread of a virus. What is a mask? It isn't just for Santa. It's to keep the public safe from spreading it."

99,47,I'm not gonna get you any better. You sound like a pretty awesome person and I've probably been working in healthcare at the time of this article.

99,52,"It's not a joke, it's the CDC."
99,54,'Wood is just a mask'
99,55,> I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask.
99,56,It's the CDC that is doing it for the public to know about and help prevent spread of the virus.
99,57,This is about the way people have sat in a costume that looks like a mask. And people don't have to wear hats to go outside.
99,58,'Wood is just a mask'. That's why it was the best idea.
99,63,"OP has done no wrong. I resent the idea of wearing a mask. And what about a sick Santa wearing a mask? Not just for them but also to make sure that the people who would be concerned are not harmed by the threat, and who want to keep them away from spreading the virus."
99,66,It's a terrible idea that I don't like and the article says that it's just the same.
99,67,It's a horrible idea.
99,73,This is exactly what the comments and questions ask me. I don't care about what a mask is. I'm just not into wearing masks.

99,81,I'd tell my family the article explains it is a joke... and a terrible idea.
99,86,That would have been a pretty big surprise to me if santa didn't wear a mask. I don't think the government should 'blame santa' for this. The CDC is going to help prevent that shit and it will not help stop it.

99,93,My favorite holiday is after you tuck in a bag of cheese. You can't make out a picture of a hulking Santa because he's sick. And you can't make it out of the ice.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,5,"It's like the joke is made up by a politician whose job is to protect the person with the virus, and that's a good thing. But hey if you don't mind me asking I'll let you know that my opinion doesn't really apply here."
99,8,The idea that you don't know how to get away from wearing a mask is a joke.
99,9,"There are many types of masks. There's a one-of-a-kind one for those who are genuinely concerned about the spreading of the virus, but there is a more naive one for those who are worried about it."
99,23,"I don't think you're going to find any answers there. The CDC has been telling me this for awhile, but not for the CDC. I don't think anyone can give the full answer, because they say so. The article is just a satire about the CDC claiming a piece of shit they don't want to hear and use to help prevent the spread of a virus. It's basically a joke and not a useful piece of advice. The CDC is focusing on helping prevent the spread of the virus."
99,25,"... But, yes, the CDC will probably want to see some sort of prevention campaign on how they are going to stop the spread of the virus."

99,33,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,36,This has been written a few times. There's really nothing they can do about it. People don't need a mask for the holidays. It's a little 'just the way people dress for Christmas' type thing.

99,57,"There is an article on the front page about a government scheme to stop the spread of a virus. It says ""The only problem with a santa mask is that they're very easy to get away with."""
99,58,I know. I just don't have the time or energy. And I don't get it.
99,63,I'm not really saying that I can't fuck with santa but I do see a problem with wearing a mask.
99,66,The CDC and the CDC are all at fault for the CDC's failure to stop the spread of a virus.
99,67,"You don't feel the same. You don't wear a mask at Christmas. You wear a mask at the holidays. You don't go to the holidays at all. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."

99,9,"I'm going to start by saying ""I hate wearing a mask."" This makes a whole lot more sense than just talking about being sick of a disease, and saying ""I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask."
99,23,ad hominems are so ridiculous. the author was just trying to savor the words of a prophet that they want to be part of their narrative to spread the virus.
99,25,>I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask.
99,27,So Santa isn't in the hospital?
99,33,> I don't know what the title of this thread is but in what way would you say this?
99,36,"No, I didn't. And no, I was not being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, as usual, as I'm just saying that there's a big gap between wearing and being sick. People shouldn't wear masks, it doesn't look good or good or healthy. And I don't see how a good thing that is actually made, especially when the sick person does it, is a bad idea."
99,41,"The government has a problem with it. And it's not funny, but it's bad."
99,45,"The CDC has made it a point to say that it's not part of the government's attempt to stop the spread of the virus, rather it's part of the government's effort to stop the spread."
99,47,"I've been to the CDC and the CDC and I think it's crazy that there's been an article about a group of people wearing a mask and it's not just them hating Santa, but that they hating Santa. It's so ridiculous."
99,49,"They aren't supposed to be immune to the virus in the first place. In fact, it is a good way to prevent you from being sick."

99,54,"I read this article in a dr. who wore a mask at Christmas time. It's one of the best books I have ever read, because I think it makes me a little more attractive. The book is a great book that I'll be spending the rest of my time watching as a doctor."
99,55,"Honestly, I don't see any reason to feel bad for the people who wear it."
99,56,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,57,"I'm not a huge fan of the CDC. I'm just sad that we don't have a new virus in the U.S., but if this is the case we don't want to talk to the public about it. This is probably the one who's most at fault."
99,58,The CDC has no right to have an article about that. It is in no way a good thing. They are making a joke.
99,63,"""Wearing a mask in the holiday season makes you a less attractive human being. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
99,66,I don't think it would be a good idea to wear a mask at the holidays. It's more of a way to make your friends feel better.

99,73,It's really just a way of making friends.

99,81,"I know a lot of people who wear masks in the CDC but I just can't figure out what a ""shit-doctor"" is. They say, ""Hey, I'm wearing a mask for the holidays, but I've been thinking about it. I wear a mask to go out on my meds and not get sick."""
99,86,"No. The only good thing is to show you the right things to do. Whenever we get sick we bring to our friends a mask to prevent people from being harmed. No one is the one who makes us suffer, but we do. If we get sick by our friends they take the best possible precautions to protect our friends. We have been able to stop the spread of this virus, and that's a very good thing to do. The problem is we can't get away with it, so we can't talk about it, or go to the hospital, etc."
99,89,They're also using it as a excuse to get away from the people who get harmed if you wear a mask.
