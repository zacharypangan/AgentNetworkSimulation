78,35,took my first flight in months for a work trip everyone wore a mask everyone was respectful of other people reminds you not all people suck most but not all
83,35,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
35,1,"OP, you ARE a man and you are an activist for a cause."
35,5,"We all have different reasons not to wear masks. There is a reason that it would be more important for doctors to not wear them. We grew up in a place where the health care system was supposed to be a medical institution, and that a mask was not as important as the safety of our children."
35,6,Isn't a solution portland oregon?>
35,8,"Oh, sorry, I was reading it as a joking comment. The wording and meaning is not correct. The only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk."
35,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,16,Hey! What's up?  We're here to help you!
35,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,21,We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks.
35,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,29,"I work in the U.S. military, and this is about what it's like to be a a prick in the military, not the federal government."
35,31,I'm a nurse and I don't want to be a jerk about a topic like this.
41,35,I don't want to be with people who think that they have a right to wear a mask.
51,35,I think you are missing the point where the guy is referring to the federal government vs. state which focuses on preventing a pandemic.
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,35,>hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance

59,35,They have a list of what they can do to get vaccinated and what their medical needs are
77,35,I think I agree with him and he seems to be quite supportive.
78,35,"It's a great post and is a little underrated, but I have seen people post on it and it seems like a good example of someone taking a long time to get through the day."
83,35,wear a mask and bend over and get a full-blown cold.
35,1,"You are saying that the only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk. Isn't a solution portland oregon?"
35,5,"If you aren't a nurse and your questioning isn't true, and if you want to be a doctor for the sake of preventing the spread of a virus, you should be a nurse. If your question is anything like ""What is the most important thing to wear in public places?"" that is absolutely absurd. I would advise anyone who wants to help out who can help with the issues at hand that they might be in."
35,6,A good example is the part of the steps deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,8,Then what's going on here? It's not about preventing a pandemic. It's about the military and health care systems. I think the government needs to focus more on cutting healthcare costs.
35,11,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,16,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,17,"I like to wear a mask while I work in the military. My job was to give me medical advice, which I was not able to do in the field of. I just don't want to be a jerk about this."
35,21,They aren't allowed to do it.
35,26,> We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,29,No I'm not being a jerk. I'm a nurse and I don't really want to be with people who think that they have a right to wear a mask.
35,31,I'm a nurse and this is a legitimate topic... what do you mean? The government uses masks to prevent spread of a virus in the USA.
41,35,"> ""The government is giving a right to wear a mask, which is a form of protest."
51,35,>I like that i was in a conservative county in california and i voted against the repeal of it. what kind of laws do you think they uphold?
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,35,So it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,35,It's not part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread.
59,35,"Affirmative action is not an emergency. In addition, it is required to be worn for a minimum of 7 days before the outbreak. The CDC's recommendations are part of the plan as it is not a permanent one. This is one of those issues that needs to be addressed. This is an emergency and it doesn't make sense to do that when the pandemic was a few days in advance of the CDC's re-enactment of the policy."
77,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
78,35,"afaik the same post by the same person, it's more relevant in this context, than I would have guessed."
83,35,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."
35,1,I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature. And you think people have a right to wear a mask.
35,5,"I've got a mask on and I need to go up to it, I'm not wearing it because it doesn't look nice."
35,6,It is a security issue.
35,8,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."
35,11,"> In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses."
35,16,"My personal experience is that the only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk. I think the government needs to focus more on cutting healthcare costs."
35,17,They aren't allowed to do it. They aren't allowed to do it.
35,21,I'm not a nurse. But this isn't a solution to a problem. I am talking about something more important to me than a virus. The thing I want to do is to look out for you.
35,26,The government can't use a mask to stop a virus from spreading. It needs to stop a virus from spreading through the government.
35,29,"The government is making an effort to stop spread of a virus, while making it a problem. If it doesn't work as intended, then what do you expect?"
35,31,The US government is a bit over the top. Its not like it is doing any good in its own right. They're all part of the government's health care infrastructure.

53,35,"So that's just the point of the article. Hopefully, you've had a decent amount of time to reflect and pause when you say that a ""mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
54,35,"Vaccinations are a form of protection to protect against any potential spread of a virus. A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."
55,35,"A lot of people eat that shit in public anyway, like a big apple."
59,35,"No I mean, I mean, you get to pick a vaccinated one, right? This seems to be a great way to check for a pandemic."
77,35,It's not a hive mind.
78,35,"It is not required to wear a mask, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
83,35,> We're going to have to stick to them and the people in tight settings.

A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."
35,5,I don't know what you mean by this. It seems like the only thing I see from a doctor's perspective is a sandbox of a mask and a mask that's a security feature.
35,6,"I've been in the military and it seems like the whole ""Filming a fuckin'mask"" thing just comes up and makes the world look like a joke."
35,8,I can imagine what this kind of attitude is getting to me as someone who is just using an excuse to have a mumps infection.
35,11,I haven't heard of a man who was vaccinated. What is the point of a mask? Is it that the person is vaccinated versus the doctor?
35,16,">I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature.

35,26,A couple of places I've been to saying the same thing.

54,35,"Is that the one in the thread? If not, where are you from?"
55,35,This sub is very good. It’s not so much about the government but the fact that they’re trying to be the big apple. And they’re trying to be the government that wants us to put a stop to the spread of a virus.
59,35,The article does not speak for the entire article. The point of a mask is to spout information to people who are not vaccinated.
77,35,I have a friend that wears a mask.
78,35,I think you're missing the whole point of the post.
83,35,You can have a full-blown cold (that is why I didn’t wear it). Wearing a mask is a good idea but you don’t necessarily want to wear a mask in those settings.
35,1,"Vaccination in general, a form of protection, is required to prevent infection, but it is not necessary to prevent infection, and is used to prevent it. It is a health tool. The FDA recommends a mask as a safety measure."
35,5,"I would recommend a mask. It looks great when you have a face, but it's more effective when you can't go in public. But the point of the mask is to spout information to people who are not vaccinated."
35,6,I've read this on this sub. This seems like the one where the hivemind is attempting to make a joke out of a joke.
35,8,"Is it a joke? It's a joke. A real joke, but it's not a joke. This is a joke. You can be a very fucking racist. If your goal is to be a fucking racist, you can be a politician. If it's not a joke, then it's not a joke."
35,11,They make a really good joke about it.
35,16,I'm in the army and I'm not sure what is going on here.
35,17,"The article makes a lot of sense because of the fact that the US has a lot of ways to protect sexism, but I guess the whole 'Filming a mask' thing comes up."
35,21,It was a bit inflammatory. It was the kind of joke that made me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago.
35,26,"A few of those times I've never seen one of those before and it made my day. It's like ""hey, they're getting better and better! Now the kids can stop that virus from spreading! You'll be the next one. You'll be the next one."""

53,35,I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying it's a great point of view and I think the question isn't how we can be trusted with a mask. I'm not in the US. I'm a doctor. I can't do the right things.
54,35,"People are saying the same thing about people like me who wear masks. That's not something I'm going to ask people to tell me. But I'm trying to keep things up. I can't get it off my mind.

35,11,In a nutshell: you don't suck at that.
35,16,...but I don't know how to get a doctor or a doctor to say I wear a mask?

55,35,In the last two paragraphs the CDC's jokes that they use to enrage and devastate people on the internet have actually been very effective.
59,35,They are not going to change the policy and in that case they will.
