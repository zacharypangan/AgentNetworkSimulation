65,24,"As painful as it is to wear the mask if it's not appropriate, then I will say why it's better to use it if not more comfortable."
66,24,I see it as a really good idea for you to keep your head down on your face when you are vaccinated because you want the public to feel better and can be informed about the threat to others.

Please wear a mask and bend over please mask up and maintain social distance people don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic. There is not a rule that prohibits people from running in a vaccinated condition. Vaccinations can be made out of many varying types of masks, from a simple mask to one that is completely unfit."
41,24,I'm so tired of people doing that. People relying on the government's protection is so much better. They don't actually have to wear a mask to keep the virus away. That's why they are there for a reason.
42,24,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

41,24,I'm not even saying the government should stop wearing a mask. I'm saying they have to be careful when they wear them because it makes people think they're just lying. And they aren't. They're a threat to the security of the community. There is a subreddit for anti trolls who would do the same thing.
42,24,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is by trying to prevent its spread in your own body
46,24,>I know how that works but if I wear a mask to protect myself or someone I haven't met with if I see them get sick I have no idea what I'm doing. Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent it; it stops it from spreading through people.

25,24,"I'm the CDC, I'm just not saying that fuck 'em.' But this is the only thing I can say that's true, since I'm a racist, and I don't really think that I would be able to wear one. I mean, I'm a very good person, but I'm able to wear my own mask as well. I do not want to be a racist. I'd like to be a superhero in my own world."
34,24,"So, I can understand how you're saying this."
41,24,I like your idea of dressing up as the Santa Clause and a mask and making a joke about how much they're lying.
42,24,I've been wearing a mask for the first time in my entire life. It was an extremely scary experience.

90,24,The e-mail was very bad. And I'm sorry that you're looking for this post.
96,24,That's one of the most important points I learned from it.
25,24,"I'm a huge fan of a mask, I think it's very cool how you can wear your own mask and not get a sick person if they want. I'm trying to find a place that has some of the same kind of protections."

42,24,"This sub has been r/advice a while, but have some insights here. The underlying point here is that you're not talking about the right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. In my opinion if it were the government, then we would just have the ""government is trying to stop the spread of a virus"" scenario that the person in question does not care about and the ""public play"" is not what you have. If it were me, I'd say that if I were wearing a mask, I'd tell the doctor or"

78,24,if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this.
80,24,A lot of people wear masks to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking.
83,24,"This isn't some old shit we have now. I remember when we were the kids. We had a lot of friends with scleroderma in the early 1990s and we were not a big fan, so it wasn't that bad.

65,24,"It's the other way around, the person who wrote the article was actually actually joking. It was not to be taken as a prank, but rather an attempt to hush the message of it. Basically, it was simply a way for the government to work together and not go around bringing up the issue."
66,24,"I would like to say that the whole ""Bird's Day"" thing is a good one."
70,24,"My mom got me a mask and I was trying to figure out why she liked it despite it being a big deal. She got me a very expensive mask, but that was too much for me. I said it's a good idea for the kids, they would go into it, they could have a great time with me. The people that don't like it don't like it, and they also don't want to look silly or have sex with me, so I think I would be very uncomfortable with the idea of it."
73,24,"What's he trying to do about it? Tell him, the fact that you're a dick and you haven't been vaccinated has to do with that."

25,24,The CDC cites the CDC to be the only medical tool to promote vaccine use. They will be implementing it in many places if they get a chance.

41,24,This is a joke. There is no such thing as a bad joke.
42,24,"I'm from Florida. I have a coma and we need to talk about this very important topic, preventing the spread of the virus and preventing the spread of the virus. It is important to know that the people who are asking for the exemption should be able to protect themselves and the public from the spread."
46,24,So you said you are getting sick? This isn't true. Unless you're in a job with the CDC. You are in a job with the government. What I'm talking about is being sick and you are being sick.
62,24,"I'm not sure why people like wearing a mask. I'm just curious. How 'likely' that will be interpreted if you don't wear a mask on a plane, or if that's just a 'likely' way to stop the spread of a virus?"

73,24,Why is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS?
78,24,Wearing a mask in public is the same as putting a mask on. There is no need to wear it to prevent people from experiencing a disease or being infected.
80,24,The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke.
83,24,"I don't really understand the context of the statement in question. Basically, you're right that a doctor can prescribe the scleroderma vaccine for free as long as he's willing to pay for it, so that you have the right to be able to get the scleroderma vaccination. But it seems like the law of the land is not quite as clear as we think."
