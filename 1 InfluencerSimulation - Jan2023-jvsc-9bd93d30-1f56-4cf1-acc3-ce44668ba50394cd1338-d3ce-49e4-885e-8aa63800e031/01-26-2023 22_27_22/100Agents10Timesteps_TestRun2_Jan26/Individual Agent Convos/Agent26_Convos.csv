67,26,please mask up and maintain social distance people
75,26,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
26,16,So people are not interested in being able to wear a mask because of the amount of time and effort it takes for them to come to an actual event.
26,22,My father is the best at making jokes like this and I hate to say it but it's a great way to show that we love our neighbors so they have enough compassion for our friends to do so.
31,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

35,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,26,I was a doctor that was the only person in the state I knew who had a virus. I never got to see him for anything except a mask. I thought I was the first to ask him about that but then he told me he needed a statewide mask and I was fine with it.

64,26,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Please Mask up and maintain social distance people please mask up and maintain social distance people
75,26,The reason for this is the pandemic
26,16,A great way to show that we love our neighbors so they have enough compassion for our friends to do so.
26,22,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,26,"I'm a nurse, and I don't like wearing masks, but I think it's funny that someone says this one a couple of times on tv."
35,26,> We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,26,"I had this question before, how does it work? How is it the government that mandates the masks?"
38,26,"As an ex-moldie, I can say it would be one of the most horrible things I have ever read in my life."
44,26,I just found the link on r/politics and now I'm going to leave my mask on. My only comment is about how the government is trying to evict people in a way that seems to be very helpful to me.
45,26,It's funny because there is a difference between a man wearing a mask and a man wearing a mask. I feel like you're referring to people who are wearing the same type of mask as me.
55,26,I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over.
57,26,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is a huge problem for the world to recognize it has a lot to do with the amount of people who don't wear a mask.
64,26,They're not really referencing the same thing. There is no need for you to wear a mask. It's a necessity.
67,26,That was a very good example of wearing a mask. It didn't help me.
75,26,"I can't get myself to wear a mask. So I just can't. It's kind of annoying, and I'm going to end up getting a cold and that makes me sick."
26,16,'I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows'
26,22,I have no idea what you mean by that.
31,26,"This is a good question. The question you asked, ""I don't wear a mask because I'm afraid I can't do it because I think it's a bad idea, but I like wearing a mask so I can get vaccinated and be more comfortable""."
35,26,The government can't use a mask to stop a virus from spreading. It needs to stop a virus from spreading through the government.
37,26,"I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. It is not. I am not a lawyer, but I can help you."
38,26,"You guys are putting so much pressure on your mother, and she's being very jaded about him."
44,26,"So, a friend of mine has a mask at his job because she was a zombie, because of the fact that she was trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
45,26,You're not wrong about that. I think that's a good way to think of it.
55,26,It's just an excuse for the people in the party whose masks a couple of months ago were not removed.
57,26,Is there a subreddit where you could link it to the article where they say 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'?
64,26,What is the difference between wearing a mask and going out and having a baby?
67,26,"My mother always wore a mask in a fight and said ""No"". She hasn't gotten one in a while, but I think she was doing the right thing by saying something along the lines of ""Well you can still have a good laugh when you're in a fight with your family."" I think she has a bad idea with the MRSA shit. I know what I mean and I think that is a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear a mask."
75,26,"The issue is that in Germany, there's a mask to prevent the spread of a viral infection."
26,16,You could go to r/politics and post a link to the article where they say that:
26,22,Is a good question a good question?
31,26,"It's the government's business. But you've been out of the country, and you don't have a job that is more important than theirs. You can't wear a mask to protect yourself, or if you do, you can't wear a mask."
35,26,A couple of places I've been to saying the same thing.
37,26,You're not a lawyer. It's a law. You're not an anti-virus advocate.
38,26,He is an idiot. I'm not sure if he should wear a mask or if it's not his. He should be using the same type of mask.
44,26,I just noticed that you have two ideas : I'm a good person.
45,26,You said the same thing in your original post.
55,26,">I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over."","
57,26,I am not sure how this is even possible. If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus the government will. The CDC needs to see a different perspective about what's happening. The people in the world do not care about those people but the government does. It is not a big problem if people don't wear masks.
64,26,This is a very good way to say the word.
67,26,I think we should have a discussion about this topic if the people who use masks aren't willing to spend money on them.
75,26,"I have a friend who has a case of pandemic virus, and he wears a mask for the day. he wants to wear it in case he needs to come out and have an interesting conversation about it. I'm a doctor so I'm ok with this."
26,16,"If people don't know to wear a mask, the government can't stop a pandemic."
26,22,A good question is a good question. Does it make a good question or is it good if the answer is yes?
31,26,"I know it is a sexist comment, but I wouldn't say it's funny. I don't like being told about something that isn't the norm and not the government's business, but rather to say I don't wear a mask at all, since I'm actually pretty fucking unfriendly to it. It's not a joke, but it's just a way to be polite, I don't think it's funny."
35,26,"A few of those times I've never seen one of those before and it made my day. It's like ""hey, they're getting better and better! Now the kids can stop that virus from spreading! You'll be the next one. You'll be the next one."""
37,26,This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign. That's when he decided to go to the government instead of the doctors. That's when the NIH would do their own thing to block everyone who wears masks.
38,26,Is this the first thing that's been mentioned in this sub?
44,26,"It doesn't seem like the government has a right to make people wear a mask, but that's what it is."
45,26,"So, if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving."
55,26,Having a friend that wears a mask is what makes me a sceptic. I think that it's a good idea to vaccinate your kids.
57,26,"It's kind of creepy to me because they have a history of a lot of people who have no idea. They are probably aware of the effects of the virus and can't seem to get around the stigma surrounding it unless they have a mask or something. Then again, I never grew up with a friend who had a CDC."
64,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is all about people who are really into the world - they're so fucking brave that they can't even stand the thought of wearing a mask.
67,26,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
75,26,"Apparently the government isn't incompatible with what they say, a prank. The government is trying to control that and so it's not the best course of action in the whole thing."
26,16,I like to see all of the comments about the CDC and Obama on there. It's amazing that the people of the United States have a policy that only prevents people from having vaccines. They aren't all the same.
26,22,"That was so funny, that I wanted to laugh at this and then I realized there's no way to stop it. I didn't even try."
31,26,"... But what if someone was being very disrespectful, even when they were telling you this?"
35,26,"I think this is a bit of a ""porn"" kind of joke. Besides, what a joke is."
37,26,"This is why we have a statewide mask mandate. I'm assuming he's not a doctor, but a doctor who hasn't given any medical advice to you. The whole ""I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. It is not. I am not a lawyer, but I can help you."" quote came from [N.Y.C.]. The point is that it's a big deal, but it's important that the CDC and the NIH know how to use a mask and make sure they don't"
38,26,They want to prevent pandemics. The fact that the CDC is in the US is probably going to get you a lot of fucking trouble.
44,26,"Yes, the government has a right to make people wear a mask."
45,26,"A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python."
55,26,I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done.
57,26,"OP said it's a great reference, and he's not the CDC's head, but an anti -masked, anti-hijacking conspiracy theorist."
64,26,> This is pretty much a troll phrase:
67,26,"It's not ""just part of the"" problem, it's the ""what I want to wear"" issue."
75,26,[Cannot find the link for you](http://abc.org/northwest-deflation-phd/northwest/northwest/cans/canswest-deflation-phd/disease-matter-failures-and-vaccinations.html)
26,16,"> A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python."
26,22,"My dad had to put a mask on when I was a kid, and my mom and dad did the same thing. I never went out in public with my mom because of it, and I just thought she was pretty good. My father is a great actor. I like the fact that he's a troll."
31,26,"""I'm a nurse, and I don't like wearing masks, but I think it's funny that someone says this one a couple of times on tv."", ""I think it's nice that they are doing what the government is doing and say they are not working, but not that they are doing it anyway."", ""I'm just saying that the ""Filming a Mask"" thing seems very inflammatory because it's a joke. They're referring to the government's policy...."
35,26,"""Porn""? Because a lot of people are saying, """"A lot of people are saying. I think this is a bit of a ""porn"" kind of joke. Besides, what a joke is."
37,26,"I like you for this. Basically speaking a lot of people don't even know what a mask is. It sounds like you're trying to help people get a vaccine, and you don't know what it's about. That's a great way to deal with a rash and be able to have a conversation with people about how to prevent it. This is a good way to have people talk about the rash, but the point is that it's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence."
38,26,My father volunteered for a vaccine program for cancer patients because he was sick of papilloma.
44,26,"I think the government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."
45,26,Is that the same r/narcissists I used to know? I would be more averse to wearing a mask in the public place than to wearing one during the day. I don't know how to handle it.
55,26,I see no point in wearing the mask.
57,26,It's a lot to do with the amount of people who don't wear a mask.
64,26,"It seems you can't really understand this. I mean, they have a lot of things to say about wearing a mask, but this isn't the first time you've heard this. I'd like to know a little more about the context of the topic. What I would say is that if you want to get up and talk about your empathy, it's really going to be a good start."
67,26,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
75,26,"My wife had a pandemic and I had to wear a mask every time she was there, sadly."
26,16,Is the CDC a troll?
26,22,">A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python. I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done."
31,26,The 'why is it a joke' thing is very common and in a lot of countries this is considered as a joke.
35,26,The CDC is a bit odd. It's about a very specific policy and one that's not in place to get people to wear a mask. I think it's a funny joke because it is a 'no problem' policy.
37,26,You can tell the difference between a doctor with a mask and a doctor with a mask. You just tell the difference between a doctor and a doctor. There is no difference between the two.
38,26,I think you're just being oblivious to the fact that you're putting pressure on a friend in a prank.
44,26,"It's an issue of ""what do you do when you're sick""? ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
45,26,>It's funny because there is a difference between a man wearing a mask and a man wearing a mask.
55,26,> I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
57,26,"""We're a bunch of trolls, we should be doing something like this."""
64,26,I am going to guess if I wear a mask on a run.
67,26,"It's not about vaccines. It's about protecting the people who do it. There are things that don't work, but they can't fix or prevent something like that, and a virulent one isn't going to work."
75,26,">I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma virus and vaccine is not a prank."
26,16,I'd be tempted to start an argument in r/politics about a possible prank.
26,22,"I don't think we're seeing a big problem here. Vaccination does not work, but it isn't a prank."
31,26,This is one of those things where the government is essentially trying to hide its 'taylorville' mentality.
35,26,"I read a book called ""Another story about a kid who had been vaccinated."" Its a pretty good one. And it's good for your brain. It's been very good for your body and if it's a good idea to make the kids wear masks they'll get better. There's a lot more to it than just a small amount of ""innocence"" to them. But it's a good read and the truth is pretty close."
37,26,"[Nyc](http://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) has found an interesting, and often disproven, way to prevent sickening the people living in these areas."
38,26,I don't care who is the one who pranks. But in the same way I care who is the one who raps you.
44,26,The government is trying to do nothing. They haven't started the disease yet.
45,26,I have a piece about how doctors and nurses have made some apocalyptic jokes for people with a virus.
55,26,... I'm going to lie to myself about the CDC and say they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
57,26,"OP, this is pretty much a troll phrase: ""Pety is also a journalist, and hasn't authored the CIA's new [Stop Them, Stop This, Stop This...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StopThem.jpg)."
64,26,'... wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,26,"I'm in the middle of something similar. I know I had a dog named Jamya and one of my friends had cannibalism. He was not really a good person and he made a joke, but he was definitely a good guy. I was always the only person who could not believe he was a doctor."
75,26,"I've been told by some people that wearing a mask isn't a prank and that a lot of things aren't a prank. In my experience, a mask isn't exactly a prank if it's too loud or too loud. I can't think of any good things you could do if you were going to do it for fun."
26,16,"It's so funny how people think if they were only at an event for fun, that the whole ""why do you want to be at an event?"" thing is a pretty good one."
26,22,"I would love for people who wear a mask to know what's up, but not a good prank or a good joke."
31,26,The prank that I thought was funny and not funny and not about the government is a joke.
35,26,"I agree, and I've read a few stories like these in my head, but I also don't like the idea of putting a mask on when someone is vaccinated because I think it's funny."
37,26,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There's a difference between a simple sex ad, a rash ad and a rash ad in general. You can tell the difference between a doctor with a mask and a doctor with a mask. You just tell the difference between a doctor and a doctor. There is no difference between the two. I'm not sure how people get away with a nice one:"
38,26,There is a joke about him not getting vaccines because he does not feel comfortable with it. It's not a joke that he needs to wear it. It's a joke that is about a lot of people complaining about the government and that he's just doing something silly. It's not the same thing as a joke.
44,26,Why can't we all wear a mask at work? Because our NSA is using masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
45,26,I'd like to add that this is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while.
55,26,"This is a joke, not a joke. I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the ebola epidemic."
57,26,It's also a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is a major part of helping stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is a major part of helping stop the spread of AIDS.
64,26,"I want to say it's really funny and it's really sad that someone would use it to insult me... and it's so sad that people say something like, I'm not a doctor and I don't wear a mask and that people who wear masks make up the entire reason for it, they rely on me to do it and I won't even think it will stop it. I do believe there is some sort of political guffaw in this because people wear them and are trying to be honest with the govt. I think the gov't has"
67,26,"I'm a santa fan, so I'm curious as to why the santas have the right to wear masks in their houses."
75,26,The only thing I'm interested in about this is the question of whether you should wear a mask to protect yourself?
