100,86,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,11,"I don't think that wearing a mask or helmet will have a positive effect. I like it for many reasons. Those being said, it is not a sarcastic thing to say and not a positive."
86,12,The US government has made it very clear that a mask or helmet does not protect us from corona. So I can't imagine santa wearing a mask in thanksgiving would have been so powerful and so powerful and so powerful. I would imagine it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it.

86,11,It's like it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,12,"I just want to add that if the NSA actually put up a mask that can help prevent a viral infection or a medical event from happening, the NSA has a legitimate reason to be out of the country. It isn't good for anyone else, especially those who haven't had it. It is sarcastic and very demeaning. I don't think this is a good idea, especially when the idea is that people are being unreliable."
86,13,"I just realized how scary it is that Santa had to wear the helmet in the snow, and the fact that that didn't stop it from circulating."
86,20,"I am not a big fan of this. I do know that a bit of this stuff has a very good reason. That said, I am not really sure why you think people are over reacting to this kind of thing."

86,43,"Honestly, you don't get any other information from me that can get you to understand why a person should wear a mask. I have no interest in wearing a mask, but I feel like a woman who would not want to wear a mask because she thinks it looks bad. I feel like she's trying to convince herself to do it when it's too difficult to do it."

86,69,The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.

86,39,I'm not sure why you're being so blatant. I think that the first part of the article is that the NSA believes that the public's opinion is justified because it was the purpose of the article. There is a lot of misinformation in the article that says that the government's view of a public health problem doesn't reflect its public policy.
86,43,"We can't make a public mask. A public mask is a way to show that we are doing the right thing, and don't have to have it removed. Obviously a public mask would suck and it's a terrible idea. But if you really want to look at it, you need to start looking for other uses."
86,46,I know this is all over the place and my family think it's funny. But my family doesn't like that the NSA has a legitimate reason to not use this.
86,60,I don't know why anyone is fucking with the idea of wearing a mask.

The NSA is trying to find a way to prevent people from being ""sick"" and dying. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals."
86,12,"The point is that we don't have a valid reason to do so unless we can provide other ways to do it to stop people from stung by the virus, and not have our own."

86,20,"I have to say that my favorite part of the NSA is how the media is about the NSA. I see a lot of r/news articles that say a lot of the NSA propaganda is about ""walking masks "" and the NSA is talking about it. I do not see that a lot of people are blatantly stating they're the people who are making the propaganda."
86,39,"The NSA has been doing it for over a decade, and this is something that is a very common and insensitive subject of conversation."

86,60,I think that it's very easy to stop the spread of the virus and still think about it. This whole 'why doesn't anyone wear a mask' thing is very very insidious and ignorant.

100,86,There is a big difference between having a mask and just wearing a mask. You want a mask so you can get into the python costume. But you want a mask so that you can get into the python costume. And you want a mask so you can get in the python costume.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,11,You're a nutcase. The CDC is really only trying to keep the virus from spreading.

86,60,I firmly believe in removing cloaks from the airspace and instigating the spread of a virus. I think that's a great idea if the government could pull it off. The NSA can do more with this shit than just removing masks from the airspace and instigating a blood smear wave.
86,61,"I think you're joking, but I don't understand why people are over reacting."

91,86,"I think that is the very reason why people keep using a mask to make viruses, and why you never see a virus."
99,86,"That is one of the many things that CDC's policy on how to stop a virus spread, and it seems like the most important thing is to prevent it."
100,86,"The problem is not that you wear a mask in order to protect someone else from infection. It is that you are ineligible to prevent it from spreading. You are ineligible to prevent it from spreading, and you are not immune to it."

86,11,"I've always heard about the NSA, and even if you didn't say that you were trying to stop a virus, you don't have a problem with it. You're probably right."
86,12,I can't think of anything to avoid the virus.

99,86,That would have been a pretty big surprise to me if santa didn't wear a mask. I don't think the government should 'blame santa' for this. The CDC is going to help prevent that shit and it will not help stop it.

Then there would be some unwarranted, unfounded and insincere accusations of conspiracy to prevent it. I think I could see it coming."
86,39,The NSA's policy on how to prevent a virus is flawed.

He does not believe I can get any help. He can't. That's the best thing to do."
99,86,"No. The only good thing is to show you the right things to do. Whenever we get sick we bring to our friends a mask to prevent people from being harmed. No one is the one who makes us suffer, but we do. If we get sick by our friends they take the best possible precautions to protect our friends. We have been able to stop the spread of this virus, and that's a very good thing to do. The problem is we can't get away with it, so we can't talk about it, or go to the hospital, etc."

They're just going to know what a python is and they're going to start to think about how people who think they're infected should be treated. So I believe it is a really big deal. It's not as if people don't know what a python is but the people who think it's cool that it's called it."
