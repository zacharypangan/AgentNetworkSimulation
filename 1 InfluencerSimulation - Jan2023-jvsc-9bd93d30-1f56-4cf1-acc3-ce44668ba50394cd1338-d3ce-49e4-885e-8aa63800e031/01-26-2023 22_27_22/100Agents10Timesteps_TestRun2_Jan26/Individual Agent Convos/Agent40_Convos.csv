40,17,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

80,40,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
81,40,mask protect other people he only cares about himself
87,40,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
40,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,40,I think the idea is that there are other people who can do what they want. This is why the people in the first place are wearing masks. That’s why they wear masks.
55,40,The government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus. This is just part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread.
58,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

69,40,"You know what... i m a full vaxxed w proof, still wearing a mask, and i am so excited to get to run around in my hoodie with a mask."
73,40,... I think you're being a very condescending and dick-faced person.
80,40,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
81,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,40,"I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. Vaccinating is an integral part of being able to deal with the virus."
40,17,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
45,40,"I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
55,40,This is why I don't wear my mask and do not wear my face.
58,40,I can't understand how I feel about someone that isn't going to do what is best for everyone and thinks there's no purpose for their mask. I can only understand the sense that a person that doesn't think they should wear a mask has been lied to by their peers. I just don't know what they do anymore and I would definitely rather not wear a mask than the amount of time they are out. I would be upset if it were not to be a piece of shit.
59,40,"You mean if you get vaccinated from the government, you get to pick a vaccinated one for the syria pandemic, the one for the national pandemic?"
69,40,"I don't think you're wrong, but you're wrong, too. Your mother is absolutely right to vaccinate you."
73,40,"I want to apologize for the words that I have said, but what I have not said was that he is a dickhead and I know he isn't a dickhead - but he isn't in any way a dickhead. He is not, in fact, being an impersonator."
80,40,It's a pretty cool thing to see a bunch of people wearing a mask and then pretending to be a doctor.
81,40,I'm a person who likes to wear masks to protect myself and protect others. My parents bought me one that they would wear every year if they had a baby. My dad was one of the people who bought the mask that they gave him.
87,40,"i was not talking about the avg, and i did have the avg a week ago, and i just wanted to make sure that I was comfortable with it. It seems pretty ridiculous that i can vaccinate others in public if i am able to safely wear a mask when i am in public."
40,17,"They don't say ""they are not wearing masks"" that's just the same as a mask."
45,40,I think it is a good idea. It isn't necessarily a good idea to put a mask on outside because of it being the only way to prevent a virus from spreading.
55,40,I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus?
58,40,"[...and I'm pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.” [Status](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_events_as_status_for_the_job_fucking_your_name_and_i_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_m)."
59,40,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again.
69,40,So you're trying to think of this as a joke? That's not true.
73,40,"""... I want to apologize for the words that I have said, but what I have not said was that he is a dickhead and I know he isn't a dickhead."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_HypercrowHypercrowHypercrowHypercrowHypercrow). No. That's not a good idea. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
80,40,I wear a mask and bend over to the point where I slap on my life jacket and a mask is put in the wrong place. Having a mask and bend over to a mask will keep a virus in check while you are in the hospital. You're wearing a mask and bend over to stop a virus.
81,40,"It's not like you were given an opportunity to expose your kids to the virus, or the idea of them learning that 'I don't care about myself, and I don't care about you'."
87,40,"They are talking about a virus, not a doctor. The mask is being used to try to prevent it."
40,17,"If you're worried about your health and health, try asking your doctor."
45,40,I read the whole thing a long time ago.
55,40,"I think the post is too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true. I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask all year, and if I had one, I would."
58,40,"In the United States, you can wear a mask in public with permission to use it, but you'll need to wear a life jacket if you don't want to use it."
59,40,"I know what you mean, but a person who isn't in a wheelchair is likely a delinquent. I haven't been here long, and it's been a while since I've had the opportunity to go outside to get vaccines because they felt comfortable - even to the point of slipping into a room tucking in the bathroom. It's not like I'm the only one who feels that way about vaccines."
69,40,"Almost any government program has to offer some kind of vaccine, as long as there are none that are bad or infected."

80,40,People are wearing masks and pretending to be doctors in an attempt to protect themselves.
81,40,"The way he was responding is to make him laugh, or even say: ""No. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop."""
87,40,>Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.
40,17,Why don't we just get a mask for the ebola epidemic? We are all infected. But you have to do what you can to avoid an influx of vaccines.
45,40,It's not a joke. It's a message.
55,40,Vaccinating people can get rid of a lot of viruses and is a huge one to deal with.
58,40,i haven't even seen it and it is not a good idea
59,40,"I'd like to suggest that we bring in more people and change things so that they don't get sick, and to ensure that it can be prevented. That's what the American Medical Association is trying to do to prevent this."
69,40,The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
73,40,If he doesn't have a mask that will stop the spread of a virus then it won't be able to stop them.
80,40,"The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke. I'd be pretty sure you can get a face mask when you are sick without it. I'd be pretty sure you can get a mask when you are sick without it. I'd be pretty sure you can get a mask when you are sick without it. I'm going to guess wearing a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus,' 'I'll not do anything else'?"
81,40,I can't find any way to tell what people would say.
87,40,So you are going to have to start a rant? Is this the same thread that you are ranting about? Or is there a rant that's really a joke?
40,17,I don't think it's funny that people would make fun of him. He just did it to get the public to see he's being used to a mask.
45,40,I am not the same person as you. It is not a joke. It's a message. It's a joke.
55,40,"The first thing you should think about is how to treat a virus. This is just the beginning of a good discussion between people on the wiki, aka ""the government"" to ""stop the spread of a virus."""
58,40,I have a friend who uses a mask to help with his HIV infection.
59,40,"The reason for this is that these vaccines are being abused and used as an excuse to try and prevent more deaths from the spread of the disease. I'm not saying they should stop or prevent these actions, but I do feel like that is one way to help people who are actually sick."
69,40,"If you're still wearing a mask, you're just using it as a dick move. It would be a bit weird to try it on someone else."
73,40,Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of a day Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,40,This is one of the most common jokes in healthcare.
81,40,"I don't understand why people would be able to take a joke at face value with me when it's a joke, or how people are being downvoted for it? Because, like, it's not a joke, it's an inflammatory post, so it's a satire."
87,40,"Yes, it does! You said this was what everyone says in this sub, but I was just thinking about it for an hour... ah, so the joke was..."
40,17,"The ad of the joke ""A rant"" is a joke. You may not be the most comfortable being called out for it but the majority of people will have no idea how to feel or respond to the joke. If it's all the same thing, no matter what a joke or quote is, I'll be the one to go and ban it if I see you are serious."
45,40,"I don't care how silly this is, but I'd just try to get the story straight."
55,40,">Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of the virus.', No one has anything to worry about. I think the people in this post are probably just describing a rabid anti-vaccination fan."
58,40,"""[...and I'm pretty sure he’s going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me. I’ve just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on, so I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me."" [Status](http://www.dcpvr/dcpvr_advice/dcpvr_advice/d"
59,40,People in this sub tend to talk about health insecurity and not that it's a health issue. It's the issue that I have to deal with to be treated for and have our children be treated. And we do need more people to get involved to prevent this from happening again.
69,40,I think this is how people make it so it doesn't sound so nutty. It's because the NSA makes them so stupid because they don't actually understand what they're doing :-)
73,40,Isn't it part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus?
80,40,"People can wear a mask and bend over to stop the spread of a virus, because that's one of the primary reasons they get sick. The reason for that is because they believe that a mask will prevent a virus from spreading and prevents it from spreading."
81,40,Vaccines are very dangerous. But if the federal government does something about them then it's not worth the risk.
87,40,"If you can't take a mask, then you won't be able to get vaccinated."
40,17,"In regards to the ebola joke, the question is, how do we get people to stop being infected when the vaccines are being used to try and stop the spread of the virus?"
45,40,You cite that line somewhere.
55,40,"Aww. It's been awhile since I went to the doctor, but I've been wearing it for all of the holidays. It doesn't stop me from getting the papilloma vaccine. It's not a joke. I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus."
58,40,"The government slashes the price of a mask by putting it on your face, not you."
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system. You're going to have to make a choice if you aren't vaccinated. The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again. This is a great reason to be sick and sick. If the CDC’s new fap test wasn’t passed before the virus was born and that’s a good reason to have it. The people who do not want to be in the same situation as you do not know what 
69,40,Yes. Apparently that's a joke that's just not funny.
73,40,You need to get tested to determine if it's a 'bug' or if you can't get the vaccinations.
80,40,It's one of the most common jokes in healthcare. A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
81,40,"I'm not sure if I'm a joke or a joke or just a joke, but this is one of those things I find funny."
87,40,I've never been vaccinated. It's not a big deal.
40,17,You don't even look at the headline right when you see the text.
45,40,Wearing a mask doesn't protect you from getting infected. It does prevent you from getting infected.
55,40,So there's a lot of misunderstanding going on here involving the ebola epidemic.
58,40,There's a lot of stuff in this thread called [[[Gealing a Mask]](https://www.r/politics) that is really good.
59,40,Vaccination is not a health issue. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable.
69,40,>(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent.
73,40,"I don't know where I'm going, but I think the part where he says ""I don't have a mask that will stop the spread of a virus. He said he'd just be a doctor, not that he's doing it."""
80,40,"It is a joke, but it's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke."
81,40,You know this is my work.
87,40,I think the problem is that vaccines have to be injected with good bacteria to keep people from getting the flu. That's why they are called antivirals. That's the reason that there are so many vaccines available for that reason.
40,17,>A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur.
45,40,"There is no reason not to wear a mask, so you have a reason not to wear one."
55,40,"I wear a mask all the time, but I'm never a bit overly concerned about the CDC. But this is a prank. The CDC is a big organization and is always willing to cut costs to stop people from spreading this disease."
58,40,"This is so stupid. You should read the book 'Being a Doctor,' and read the book in the spirit of that book."
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system.
69,40,"I have a friend that is very good at writing jokes. He was really funny with his 'What is your name?', but I was not allowed to see him on my own. I think he knew how to do a prank. I wasn't into pranks or anything like that. The one time I got sick and told my dad I had the CDC. He said something along the lines of, ""I'm in a bad place and this is a prank and I'm not going to get a prank but I don"
73,40,Yes. You can stop the spread of a virus. I think the next part is a joke because the government doesn't want to take a new vaccine or get a vebbulbdog. No. It's a joke because they are trying to keep things up.
80,40,Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a symptom of a symptom of a symptom of a disease. It is a symptom of a disease.
81,40,It is possible to see a virus that can spread into all of the US without actually actually identifying as a virus.
87,40,"I am not a troll and this is my favorite, but when I read the title, I read the link in full. I'm not a troll, but I am not a troll."
