79,59,"In addition to the law on wearing a mask, the government wants to have people cover themselves with a mask so it can help with the illness."
84,59,Oh my goodness! i m going to my local nvp sports park for a drive up test this Saturday.
59,10,"It's called the afaik in nyc, where a fap test is still required and that the vaccine is not mandatory for vaccinating. I'm sure there is still evidence that kids got vaccinated, but the government doesn't have the mandate yet."
59,13,When I visited Tx I found out that a number of things were happening on the scene - one of them was a group of sick kids who came to their local park because they thought it was a good idea to wear a mask.
59,15,We are going to have to put on a mask. We will be using a mask.
59,28,I don't think we're going to talk much if they don't give us a lot more information about vaccines than they do. We aren't talking about vaccination at all.
59,35,"Affirmative action is not an emergency. In addition, it is required to be worn for a minimum of 7 days before the outbreak. The CDC's recommendations are part of the plan as it is not a permanent one. This is one of those issues that needs to be addressed. This is an emergency and it doesn't make sense to do that when the pandemic was a few days in advance of the CDC's re-enactment of the policy."
59,40,"You mean if you get vaccinated from the government, you get to pick a vaccinated one for the syria pandemic, the one for the national pandemic?"
59,51,"I just wanted to let everyone know a little about the recent changes on vaccinations in the US, it seems a good way to be sure it's safe."
59,54,"You said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated"
59,56,"Assuming there was proof in the article that your child was vaccinated, then you are right - unless you have the vaccine. Thats not what the article says. The article is a misrepresentation of the context."
70,59,"It is almost like a CDC thing. If you wear a mask, it is likely to spread the virus from other parts of the world."
75,59,> Are you still wearing a mask?
79,59,Why would someone who lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official?
84,59,"There's this weird ""I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick"" syndrome."
59,10,"Are you still wearing a mask? Why would someone who lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official? There's this weird ""I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick"" syndrome."
59,13,"Well, I can't really speak for all these children who are vaccinated because they have never been on an airborne pandemic vaccine, so it's not really all that different from what they wear, I think."
59,15,"I'm not sure what that is, but that's not how this is going to play out. In addition to the laws on vaccinating, the government wants to have people cover themselves with a mask so it can help with the disease. I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick."
59,28,"No, I am not. Affirmative action is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again."

59,51,CDC recommendation is a misrepresentation of the context.
59,54,"It's not the government's job to have a CDC issue and if a government mandate was not implemented to ensure everyone was in the protected class in the form of a fap test, it's an emergency."
59,56,"I don't know what the context is, but I know that a lot of the questions here are posed as to why a man wearing a mask and being pushed back by an elected official might make him ill, and this might have more to do with it, than the article states, since it is a common misconception that kids who are not on the vaccinated list are at risk of being caught. If he's just sick of being pushed back, then he has an interest in helping the poor he can do, and therefore are more likely to have a"
70,59,"> We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
75,59,"The fact that they said ""the only way you'd be able to stop the spread of the virus is to get the new mask off,"" does not seem to be a joke. I would say it's more about making sure you're not wasting masks."
79,59,"This is an important topic in my political history class and I'd like to add that people are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
84,59,[Researcher](https://research.nyc.gov/wiping/comments/wiping/comments/miami_virus_diagnosis/raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family_disorder/) is an interesting article. It relates that people who wear masks like paintball do so because they are uncomfortable.
59,10,"You’re not going to get sick, you are going to make a bad choice in your life and go crazy. What’s the point of getting vaccinated in the first place?"
59,13,"The most important part of this story in my experience is that you can't just wear a mask for the purpose of preventing someone from getting sick if they are vaccinated. I mean, I mean, I'm not sure what's wrong, but I'm definitely sure there's a better way to look out for the fap test in the US."
59,15,"It seems like it is something the US has been doing for a long time. The CDC has been trying to keep it as a policy and is now making some changes to it, like changing the laws for kids in the form of a fap test or something. It's very easy to make an attempt to make a policy that allows for the safety of the public."
59,28,My friends at college said that it was an important topic in our class. So what's the point of having a mask on in case of an emergency?
59,35,The article does not speak for the entire article. The point of a mask is to spout information to people who are not vaccinated.
59,40,"I know what you mean, but a person who isn't in a wheelchair is likely a delinquent. I haven't been here long, and it's been a while since I've had the opportunity to go outside to get vaccines because they felt comfortable - even to the point of slipping into a room tucking in the bathroom. It's not like I'm the only one who feels that way about vaccines."
59,51,... Because this will have an effect on the rest of the world and will make the environment for all of us better - by protecting our citizens and improving our quality of life.
59,54,"The CDC recommended ""Blind Blue Bloods, the best in the world."
59,56,"There's no ""trouble with the rule for you to vaccinate your kids"", because vaccinating them doesn't mean preventing the spread of the virus."
70,59,">we should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
75,59,What's this? I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
79,59,"The F.B.D. has a very large family in Texas, having one mask. This is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while. I'm pretty sure you guys would have no problem bringing your husband to a rally, because he is a very large family in Texas, has one mask. This is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while. I'm pretty sure you guys would have no problem bringing your husband to a rally, because he's a"
84,59,[https://www.nihilist.com/articles/38790.html) : It's really a shame they took you to a drive up test. The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues.
59,10,"It seems like they can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
59,13,"This is a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
59,15,"Is it possible to get the government to help people get vaccinated? If not, then that doesn't work."
59,28,If a school or family member gets sick they get a vaccination. This is a medical issue that the government is not supposed to address. In my country it's a non-emergency. That's why I don't take it seriously.
59,35,"The CDC has been doing this in the US for a long time, and they are working on it in recent years."
59,40,"I'd like to suggest that we bring in more people and change things so that they don't get sick, and to ensure that it can be prevented. That's what the American Medical Association is trying to do to prevent this."
59,51,We are all going to be sick of the idea of the CDC being such a big piece of shit and not getting anything done.
59,54,There are a lot of ways to combat this problem - a public health snarky or a fap test-- and you can easily stop a fap test if it's necessary.
59,56,Vaccination in general is a part of the health care system. You’re going to have to make a choice if you aren’t vaccinated. It’s a bad idea and will just make the people in the minority more likely to have the disease. That’s a great reason to be sick and sick. If the CDC’s new fap test wasn’t passed before the virus was born and that’s a good reason to have it.
70,59,I do not care what your kids wear but it’s a shame.
75,59,"That's what I had in mind when I read it: ""Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. In order to save the environment, people must wear masks. They are not a substitute for the health care or a treatment for the illness. They don't require that people wear them unless they are a threat to the public."""
79,59,"In a large US country, you can not wear a mask at Christmas, you can't wear a mask at any kind of holiday. It isn't illegal. You cannot wear a mask for Christmas. You can wear your husband's and his family's health insurance policies. The government doesn't have a choice about whether or not to accept or not to refuse your treatment for your health, you have to accept the fact that your health insurance plan covers you and allows you to do so. You are being taken a different kind of healthcare. So in an international emergency you need"
84,59,>We don't wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall.
59,10,"It's a big deal that the CDC doesn't have the mandate to have vaccines in all of the developed nations. That's a huge problem, and a very big problem."
59,13,"I read that it said ""But we're in the process of trying to get things done and the CDC is trying to bring people to safety and to make sure we don't get vaccinated."""
59,15,"Vaccines can help prevent the spread of a disease, but they don't do it to stop the spread of the disease. You can't expect your children to get vaccinated, that's a completely unreasonable expectation that anyone in your family is going to get the papilloma virus."
59,28,> we should wear a mask in every emergency
59,35,They are not going to change the policy and in that case they will.
59,40,"The reason for this is that these vaccines are being abused and used as an excuse to try and prevent more deaths from the spread of the disease. I'm not saying they should stop or prevent these actions, but I do feel like that is one way to help people who are actually sick."
59,51,"It is illegal to wear a mask on Christmas, for whatever reason. This is the one thing that doesn't help in emergencies: it prevents the spread of a virus."
59,54,My country only needs about 25k people for the vaccine. I think it's a good sign they don't want to pay for all the public shaming.
59,56,Vaccination in general is a part of the health care system. You're going to have to make a choice if you aren't vaccinated. It’s a bad idea and will just make the people in the minority more likely to have the disease. That’s a great reason to be sick and sick. If the CDC’s new fap test wasn’t passed before the virus was born and that’s a good reason to have it.
70,59,The people who do not want to be in the same situation as you do not like wearing a mask and you do not like the CDC have a right to make that policy and it doesn't matter.
75,59,"People who don't know what a python costume is, are really weird."
79,59,"The only time I see them wearing the mask is the one I find most affable. Until then I think they're just assuming that they can be in their own homes without a mask - as they could just have a more obvious way to do it for you, as if they had the power to wear a mask that you couldn't wear for any reason."
84,59,"The article on Right in the Mirror does a really great job of giving context to this, and makes some good points."
59,10,Vaccination is not part of the health care system.

I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."", ""I read that it said ""But"
59,15,"So what do you mean ""I don't want to be in the same situation as you do not know what a python costume is""?"
59,28,[Teens can wear a mask at any time. ](http://www.dbc.gov/publications/faptests/articles/python-comments/)
59,35,"In any case, I have a hard time imagining anything being done by the CDC in order to save the environment, let alone the health of our population in general."
59,40,People in this sub tend to talk about health insecurity and not that it's a health issue. It's the issue that I have to deal with to be treated for and have our children be treated. And we do need more people to get involved to prevent this from happening again.
59,51,I would make a python costume and shave it at Christmas to save the environment.
59,54,"This is the one that made me really wonder, was it a ""Damn it! We got vaccinated now!"
59,56,It's a good sign that the CDC doesn't want to make any changes to the healthcare system and won't change it.
70,59,So... we need to wear a mask to prevent people from getting infected with a virus. It's not a good idea to be able to have a python that's in a python.
75,59,"I can't believe that I've come into a situation where I'm not going to be a doctor. I'm not a doctor, and my family is a doctor."
79,59,"This is like saying that I am getting down voted for using the word ""fucking hugger"" in your title."
84,59,So it's a good idea to get the NSA out of the system. That's what they're doing.
59,10,"It's a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
59,13,Vaccination is not a part of the health care system.
59,15,I'm also a pediatrician who was raised in a similar situation with my friends. I was vaccinated but it never became effective because a mask doesn't work because it faps. I was taught this by a doctor and was told that it doesn't work because if I smoked it I would be dead.
59,28,CDC tries to slash their power by securing their funding. This shit is a crime. The CDC can't force people to be immune to vaccinations.
59,35,You can wear a mask on christmas if you want to. This is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus.
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system. You're going to have to make a choice if you aren't vaccinated. The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again. This is a great reason to be sick and sick. If the CDC’s new fap test wasn’t passed before the virus was born and that’s a good reason to have it. The people who do not want to be in the same situation as you do not know what 
59,51,I think there's a reason for that. The CDC has the right to say something that isn't ok.
59,54,People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable.
59,56,"Well, it's not an anti-virus. Vaccination isn't a health issue in a sense."
70,59,"As a non-emergency vaccine recipient, I can't think of a single person who'd ever do that to me."
75,59,So I'm not a doctor and my family is a doctor. But I've been vaccinated and got a lot of help for this. I feel sick every time and I'd rather be vaccinated for the flu.
79,59,"I'm not sure it's true, but it's worth rereading. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What is the problem with this? Why do you think that the US government should be allowed to wear a mask all the time? The masks aren't mandatory in the US. They're required for 50 days during the year, for example."
84,59,This is a bit naive.
59,10,"I'm a doctor. The CDC is responsible for the costs of vaccines, and so is any federally mandated government. So they need to be made a part of their funding policy."
59,13,I'm not sure what that means. Vaccination is not a part of the health care system. The CDC has the right to say something that isn't ok. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird.
59,15,"As a kid, I'd have to wear a mask in public. That's my job."
59,28,> In my country it's a non-emergency. That's why I don't take it seriously.
59,35,The CDC hasn't acted appropriately. It's also trying to get a sham with the NSA for not changing its policy to prevent a pandemic and the government should.
59,40,Vaccination is not a health issue. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable.
59,51,"The CDC has a right to say something that isn't ok. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable. Well, it's not an anti-virus. Vaccination isn't a health issue in a sense. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable."
59,54,A mask that has been around for 50 days is an anti-virus. If you get sick then you're going to be sick. And you're likely to get sick. This isn't just a dick move.
59,56,The CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady. Vaccination is not a part of the health care system.
70,59,"The government can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
75,59,"""Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic"""
79,59,"""... the government is basically saying you can't really have a meaningful and meaningful discussion about why the government isn't allowed to use the same amount of time and effort to try and prevent the spread of the virus."
84,59,"I think you’re having a bit of a 'naive' point about what the NSA is doing here, as they seem to be taking too much money away from the people that really need it."
59,10,The government has already spent a lot of money on the NSA and its hat. They are doing this for fear of the public health disasters. I think I understand what you are saying a bit but isn't a medical scientist?
59,13,And now we know how to make a mask so you can not smell a virus or any other stuff while he's wearing a mask.
59,15,The CDC is making changes to the policy and the CDC is trying to get a sham with the NSA.
59,28,The whole point of vaccines is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again.
59,35,Vaccination is an emergency. I feel sick every time and I'd rather be vaccinated for the flu.
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system.
59,51,"I don't know if I agree with you on any of those, but in my country it's mandatory. I've been vaccinated for the flu. I've not even had an accident yet, but if I get sick from it, it's pretty normal. And I never wear it as a smear to avoid it. I don't feel it was necessary for me to have a vaccination. I'm not sure if you've ever thought about it but I don't even know what your talking about."
59,54,"The government wants the public to believe their decisions, not the government's."
59,56,It's like an exercise to keep yourself at peace. The CDC's right to make it a health issue. I don't want you to feel like I am.
70,59,Is this the worst thing that happened to the American people when the US started the NSA?
75,59,"i dont get it, its not a prank, i don't think it's a joke. i'm not going to get hurt from having to wear a mask and I don't think it would even be a joke."
79,59,"You're using a different word than the one you're using, it's a slam."
84,59,"The NSA has the right to do everything it wants, so you can't buy it from them. And it is acting as a threat to the public health system, so you have no obligations to wear a mask."
