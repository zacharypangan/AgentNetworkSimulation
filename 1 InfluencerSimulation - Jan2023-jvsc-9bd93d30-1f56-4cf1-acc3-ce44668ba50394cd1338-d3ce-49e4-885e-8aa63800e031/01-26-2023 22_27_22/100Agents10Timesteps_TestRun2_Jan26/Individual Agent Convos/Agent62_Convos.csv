62,11,Isn't that the only excuse to wear a mask on a flight?
62,16,You're the only one that seems to wear a mask. You're not the only one. I'm not saying I'm wearing a mask for your health but it's a bit too obvious that you're not.

85,62,That's pretty fucked up. I'd do it if it weren't for my vebbulldog.

62,50,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
62,55,There is only one way to prevent this.
62,56,"I was a little tired from the last couple days of work in Canada. I could wear a mask and the air was a little uncomfortable. I wasn't thinking for a moment, but it was a really good thing I was wearing a mask."
62,60,"It's a hazy thing to do for fear of a virus. It doesn't work for me, and I think a lot of people are just wearing it for fun. People have already tried to use it for good. It makes it more threatening to others. It's like saying I'm in the same boat, I'm in the same boat as you and you're not a bad person."
62,61,A guy with a fat lip and a fat lip in wore a mask on his first flight on a flight to Canada. He threw it off because it was uncomfortable and he didn't want to wear it on a flight with a fat lip and a fat lip in. He also got pissed when he heard he was wearing a mask and was trying to be polite with everyone in the crowd. It was hilarious!
78,62,"It is not required to wear a mask, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,62,This isn't a mask. It's just a mask. They're there to prevent the spread of a virus. It's supposed to stop you.
85,62,I can't wait to hear about this and to learn more. My first thought is: “We don't wear a mask. I don't wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall”.
101,62,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
62,1,I've been wearing a mask in the UK for a few years now.
62,3,Well that explains why my vebbulldog has to wear a mask.
62,11,Is there a medical or religious reason why you wouldn't wear a mask on a flight? I've never seen people wear masks. It's just not necessary.
62,16,People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health.
62,24,Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.

62,50,"I've been through a lot of people who don't like wearing a mask. That's probably because I'm a bit insecure, but it is really important for people like me. And to help prevent the spread of the virus. So it doesn't take too long to have the same effect, and it isn't something I can do."
62,55,I think there's a lot of people that are going for a jump on this one.
62,56,That vebbulldog was wearing a mask for his first flight. He wasn't even trying to help by wearing a mask.
62,60,He's wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus. He's wearing a mask to stop the spread. He hasn't been trying to stop the spread.
62,61,So you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus? That's pretty fucked up. I'd do it if it weren't for my vebbulldog. Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

80,62,"""Have you seen this rant?"" I can't believe that I am here."
85,62,"I mean the whole thing is pretty silly and not what I thought it was, but I do want to hear the facts because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems. If he doesn't want his dog to get sick or infected then I don't want the same thing from him,"
101,62,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
62,1,I'm not a fucking moron but I have seen my husband wearing a mask on his birthday and he doesn't look like he needs it. I think his first thought is to tell him it would be good to have him and your husband with him. It's not a rant.

62,24,i wear a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows.
62,42,"He said that it's not necessary to wear a mask and didn't say ""you could wear one if you wanted"", so he has to wear it. It seems like he's trying to avoid it. Is there any other reason he was wearing a mask? He was not in that position in the first place."
