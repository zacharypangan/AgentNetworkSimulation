15,6,Why did I say that? Because I was told that I am not on the right side of the fence and I don't want to put the whole shit in there.

43,15,"Vaccinations are a major public health issue. You need to get a vaccinatation ASAP. You can't put a mask on everyone in your family, and they do a good job of keeping the people safe."
45,15,That is a funny thing to say. I can't even imagine how the government would want to stop that.
59,15,We are going to have to put on a mask. We will be using a mask.

70,15,"So I think it's a bit pathetic to think that the government should require people to wear masks in any way if they need to prevent spread of a virus. If a person didn't have their hands sterilized and put on a mask, then the government should have gotten the best of both worlds - a lot of the time you can't just take a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."

76,15,"There is no ""Vach"" in the US. It's not a virus, it's a health hazard."
80,15,The government wants people to wear masks and not just to stop them from spreading. The government wants them to wear a mask so it's not illegal for them to do that.
82,15,I can't believe the government has pushed this issue so hard. There isn't enough govt spending in the US right now to stop it.
89,15,"I think that because the virus is spreading by destroying it, there must be more people in the park and the better the people at the hospital may be."
91,15,Then get a face mask.
92,15,"You're absolutely right. There is no reason to fear a virus spreading to anyone without the health care, and it has been proven in the US to be much more effective than any other vaccine."
93,15,"I think that if the US had a long history of wearing masks, that people would have no problem at all having people like this."
15,6,What I'm trying to say is that the government has to wear a mask when traveling to prevent the spread of a virus. That's why they're so naive.
15,7,"No, not the only thing the US government does is require people to wear a mask."
15,10,It is possible for someone to become ill in some way from a bacterial infection. The vaccine should not have a direct impact on their brain.
18,15,"A lot of people don't wear masks. If you can't see through the camera you have to do a very specific job, in most cases you're better off just walking and watching movies in a dark environment."

45,15,"I've been sick of seeing this guy and his stuff all over the country, I'm not sure why he wears it."
59,15,"I'm not sure what that is, but that's not how this is going to play out. In addition to the laws on vaccinating, the government wants to have people cover themselves with a mask so it can help with the disease. I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick."
60,15,"The first post was just a joke, not a meme. The guy in the headline is saying that it was a symptom of a virus, and that wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading."
65,15,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,15,>The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
70,15,"I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better. That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
74,15,"I would have had a problem with this, it's a sad problem with our society, and it's not my thing."
76,15,"Wearing a mask and bend over is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like to wear a mask and bend over so I don't wear a mask. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
80,15,"I've heard that the government wants people to wear a mask and then pretending to be a doctor. I really think it's one of those scary things you can see on a TV show, but you can't just sit there and pretend like a doctor, you can't eat food, you can't take your life. I think you're doing a pretty good job of being an extreme dick."

91,15,"i think the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
92,15,The Vaccine that helps people to live a virulent life is a good one. The reason you're so sorry for this vaccine is because of the stigma surrounding it.
93,15,"Wearing a mask to run, i wore a mask when i ran and i thought, hey, i like the idea of going to the doctor."
15,6,"That's what I'm trying to say is, ""What I'm trying to say is that the government has to wear a mask when traveling to prevent the spread of a virus. That's why they're so naive."""
15,7,I think people should take a seat in the doc.
15,10,I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
18,15,"I can see where you're coming from, but my point is that you would have to be more specific and if you would've asked for a different mask, it's probably going to have to be a much better one, but it could be a good compromise, too."
38,15,They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
43,15,"He's a saboteurs for not being able to wear a mask. The truth is that he's trying to avoid being a saboteur, and is also just trying to be a saboteurs for not wearing a mask."
45,15,"This is about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
59,15,"It seems like it is something the US has been doing for a long time. The CDC has been trying to keep it as a policy and is now making some changes to it, like changing the laws for kids in the form of a fap test or something. It's very easy to make an attempt to make a policy that allows for the safety of the public."
60,15,I'm a guy in the Army and I do have a rash every time I'm out in public i'll go out and do stuff like that. Wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading.
65,15,"We gotta wear masks in the face of sickness or get infected, right?"
69,15,if it's not an in v v i don't think it's a joke that you have the right to wear a mask
70,15,This is a shame. I don’t care about people or their privacy. The government has no right to regulate the public health system.
74,15,There's always a problem with how we communicate. You are not going to know what's going on around you.
76,15,A virus can spread all over the country. It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk.

80,15,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,"I don't know how I could stop this, but if I was hacked into a wall like this I'd wear a mask a lot. But if I were to tell the police and make them leave. It would also get them to leave."
89,15,Unless you want to avoid all of that then the link...
91,15,"I know that a lot of things are very misleading, but what if we don't get it correctly?"
92,15,"I hate to sound a little sarcastic. I don't like to snoop on the guy I actually snooped on a few times. I'm pretty sure that a lot of the facts in this article are true, so I'm going to give you a good one, though."
93,15,The joke 'Wip a mask on a run to protect yourself if you don't'is a kind of a joke if you don't want to wear it '. I don't think it's wrong for people to wear masks and it's actually quite common for people to wear them. I've always wondered if this is the same as the joke in the article.
15,6,People can't know if this is a joke or not. You don't.
15,7,"This is how if you don't care about your privacy, you'll lose a person."
15,10,It's the same thing when you don't like to talk about your own morals.
18,15,The government is using you. It's the government that's trying to stop the spread of the virus.
38,15,"I know they are putting so much pressure on their mom, and she's being very jaded about him."
43,15,"It's not a joke. It's a silly thing to say, but its a way to stop the spread of the virus. It's ridiculous to say anything like, ""I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it."""
45,15,"It was a joke. This is about how the government protects our health and yours. People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
59,15,"Is it possible to get the government to help people get vaccinated? If not, then that doesn't work."
60,15,I'm not going to lie: a virus can not cause an infection. I'm afraid that some kind of narcissists who doesn't understand the importance of wearing a mask can.
65,15,I think the issue with that is that a mask does not affect any other part of the population.
69,15,"No one is going to be able to go out with the truth, and it isn't a slapstick joke. It's a joke that's meant to hurt people. It's not a joke, and it's a joke if the reality isn't slapstick."
70,15,"So your doctor is giving you a headache, not knowing if you're infected with a virus or if it's just one bad virus, then you're infected?"
74,15,Why do people wear a mask when there is no research?
76,15,I think a few days ago the guy was having some sex with a guy who was like hey if you wanna wear a mask and bend your nose you can wear it.
80,15,> A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,A guy who hacked into a wall is actually very unlikely to ever realize the gov't is doing its job. It's also a joke that's utterly unjustified.
89,15,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,15,"When people are not really using the word ""saddle a virus"", they are using a false name that says'saddle a virus, and', which isn't exactly a lie. It's not really a good idea to say it's spreading, and then in the future you will just see it. If you wear a mask, you may as well just take it off, like a rat."
92,15,"I'm not even sure what you mean. Honestly, that's not what a python can do. I can't see anything wrong with that."
93,15,"What is it? A mask, a mask, and a tan mask? A tan mask? What's it like wearing a mask?"
15,6,That's what they said. [It was a joke.
15,7,The government is just trying to do something to save lives.
15,10,It's not just a joke. The government is not.

38,15,"I had a friend who was sick of this kind of stuff. The one person we have had a good impression of was from a guy who said, ""I've got a papilloma and I wear a mask, but I don't want to be that guy."""
43,15,"I'm on the road. But, if you're just looking to stay home, you're getting sick, and that's not a mask."
45,15,"I mean, a doctor wouldn't need to have a ""mask"" to protect someone else, but wearing a mask is a better way to prevent a virus. It's a joke. But it's not about preventing someone from getting the virus, it's about how to prevent it and how to save their lives."
59,15,"Vaccines can help prevent the spread of a disease, but they don't do it to stop the spread of the disease. You can't expect your children to get vaccinated, that's a completely unreasonable expectation that anyone in your family is going to get the papilloma virus."
60,15,"I can understand that the idea of not wearing a mask and bending over is very insidious and ignorant, but I don't understand why people think of wearing a mask as a way to help stop a disease. But I do understand why the idea that you need to wear a mask is a joke."
65,15,That's not going to get a lot of attention.
69,15,It's kind of a strange joke i know.
70,15,A person with a python mask probably doesn't know what a virus is.
74,15,I know what you mean. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,15,"I'm very thankful that the government wants to do more research into the spread of a virus, but they are not."
80,15,I can't believe this - you're being egregious.... you want to take the money you have to pay to live and work in the US?

93,15,"A mask is a type of mask that is designed to protect you from virus infection, and is used by people that wear it, so people can't actually do anything about it. In fact, the joke is more or less in the same way a nerd is saying it."
15,6,I'm sorry if I am naive. I'm an ignorant racist.
15,7,"People aren't going to put in the effort to stop the spread of the disease, or change it for the better."

45,15,"A guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor,"" and ""A guy who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end."""
59,15,"So what do you mean ""I don't want to be in the same situation as you do not know what a python costume is""?"
60,15,OP: I'm a guy in the Army and I do have a rash every time I'm out in public i'll go out and do stuff like that.
65,15,People in the government who are comfortable with wearing a mask are just using the idea of masks to prevent people from having a virus from coming into their home.
69,15,... he's being a joke in a nutshell.
70,15,This is what the CDC and CDC should be doing with the vaccination program.
74,15,I see a lot of people wearing masks. The first part of the post is a question - which seems obvious: how can you help them?
76,15,"I don't care why someone's asking you a question about ""This is a joke"" is so ridiculous that it makes no sense to say it in a way that would make it a joke."
80,15,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,"I do like this one, but it seems to be a joke."
89,15,"I see the difference between a mask and an actual one, and you do have to be able to tell a person they have a problem with when they are at a running location. A 'route' is a term used to describe a line or object with a joke in it."
91,15,NSA isn't just a tool. They are a tool of the government. It isn't a joke. The government uses the NSA's surveillance methods to help prevent the spread of a virus.
92,15,"Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it. A lot of people on the internet don't think that this vaccine is a viable solution and it's a way to protect people, and it's more about the government than the person's health, not whether or not it's effective."
93,15,There's an important difference between the first and last sentence in this article. There is no joke about how people are being manipulated in a way that doesn't even involve masks.
15,6,"""We're being a joke, this is a joke"""
15,7,Is that what the article is about?
15,10,"Is it the fact that people are being manipulated? It's not a joke to me, and it's not really a joke to me."
18,15,As a prankster who's always been stoked that the government's trying to stop the spread of viruses.
38,15,He said you're not a troll. He was joking.
43,15,I don't care where the word for it comes from.
45,15,It's a joke. And it does not mean shit. It's a joke that it isn't just for a vaccine promoting government policies.
59,15,I'm also a pediatrician who was raised in a similar situation with my friends. I was vaccinated but it never became effective because a mask doesn't work because it faps. I was taught this by a doctor and was told that it doesn't work because if I smoked it I would be dead.

74,15,"I can imagine why this would be a big deal. I am not the biggest fan of the ""We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv"" in this subreddit. I mean, I don't think you can have a joke on it, if you think people are trying to stop the spread of a virus, you just have to be brave and ask them out."
76,15,"I'm gonna say he should fuck with some guy who's swore to go to the doctor, who has the vaccine and has no medical history - it's all his fault and the guy is going to get vaccinated. You can't just take a bunch of pictures, but do it and it will work."
80,15,It seems like the government has an agenda. It seems like the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking.
82,15,"You say this like the government doesn't have a duty to defend itself - you've lied, and you need to put up with it."
89,15,"I don't think it's shady, but that's what shaming is about."
91,15,">I think the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to wear a face mask."
92,15,What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask? I'm sure there's a lot of the problems around a person who can't just see what they're doing in their head. What do you think?
93,15,"I'm not sure what the op is asking, but it sounds like he was implying that wearing a mask on a run would help prevent fecal illness."
15,6,OP doesn't have the right to disagree with you about anything. The government has no duty to protect. The government does not.
15,7,The headline is misleading. It's just a joke about how this seems to be a problem with the government.
15,10,"A person isn't a prankster, he's a politician who believes that 'the government needs to stop'."
18,15,I'm trying to tell him that I have no problem wearing a mask.
38,15,">As a medical doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who have a habit of using a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I think that he is going to make a good point, in fact, because of the way he feels about the situation."
43,15,"In fact, it's actually just that the government is trying to give it a new meaning. They're giving people more reasons to keep getting the vaccines, and also increasing vaccinating rates. Unless you are a religious or conservative person that doesn't mind the news about a terrorist who is using it as a prank, then there's no point in keeping it a joke because they don't want to."
45,15,"In the end, wearing a mask is better than putting on a stuffed animal to protect yourself."
59,15,"As a kid, I'd have to wear a mask in public. That's my job."
60,15,I think if the government stopped using it for something they need to do it would be a better place to go.

69,15,I'd probably go to the doctor and explain the idea that a mask could be used against people who wear them because they think they're being abused.
70,15,That's what I do.
74,15,"The only one I saw wearing a mask for was a dude who wore one when he sat in the office and he was saying ""hey the government is allowing dogs to come into this country, they want me to come and see my dog."""
76,15,The CDC hasn't shown this problem as an excuse. It explains why Vaccination isn't about prevention.
80,15,"i'm going to guess wearing a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus, Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus."
82,15,"""The first part of that quote was pretty bad. What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny? Because if the police don't like it then they'll tell them. Is the government doing their job well?"","
89,15,"Is the word ""machete"" actually related to the sex or health problems causing this, or the lack thereof?"
91,15,I'm asking because I've always wondered this.
92,15,"If I remember correctly, I had a mask on for my birthday. I also had a vaccine for me, but I had been having an allergic reaction to it for a year. My friend had this nastier virus. I had this nastier virus and the vaccine was causing more infections. He could not even catch a tick and I got it every week. The doctor never told me to get it."
93,15,The article's title is actually about a joke. 'Wearing a mask on a run' was the joke in the article.
15,6,I think I'm having the wrong moment to say that OP's title is misleading.
15,7,Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt. This is the same person who said the government has a right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
15,10,A prankster and a politician at the same time.
18,15,I'm a sexist joker.
38,15,"I was a doctor for 2 years. I started wearing a mask when I had a papilloma and my mouth was broken. I didn't know what a papilloma was, but i know that it could cause me serious complications. My husband had a papilloma that was not a virus. I've never felt a virulent infection in my life, though. I just wanted to help prevent this virus, and I would wear a mask when I was infected. There are no way to help in a"
43,15,"Vaccination is a major public health issue. You need to get a vaccinatation ASAP. You can't put a mask on everyone in your family, and they do a good job of keeping the people safe."""
45,15,"Is there anything in the article that said ""It is a joke."""
59,15,The CDC is making changes to the policy and the CDC is trying to get a sham with the NSA.
60,15,I think the CDC should stop doing it in this context.
65,15,"I'm not sure what the title is. I'm trying to understand what the issue is. It isn't about the actual facts, it's about what people want to see done. It doesn't matter what people think."

91,15,>It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
92,15,"So, the vaccine doesn't help, doesn't it? I've got a couple years of experience as a python tampering with me, and the only thing I've ever known that irritates me is my wife's snooping mania."
93,15,">I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it. I've never been to the NSA or any other government agency, but it sounds like they're talking about a 'virus' that can spread over the nation."
