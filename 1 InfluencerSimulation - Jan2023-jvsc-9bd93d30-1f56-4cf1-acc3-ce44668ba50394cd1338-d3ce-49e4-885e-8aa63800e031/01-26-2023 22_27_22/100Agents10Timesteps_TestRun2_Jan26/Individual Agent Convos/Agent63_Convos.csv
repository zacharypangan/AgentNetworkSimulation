63,27,"My father is very religious but he had no idea about this, and so we wore a mask to stop it from spreading."
63,47,"The euphoria of that ad is based on the fact that you can be wearing a mask on a cold day or day and if he wasn't there, you were in the sacramento."
63,60,"He's the man. We should wear a mask, and that means being able to tell when a person is sick or just not listening to him. He's the man. The government isn't supposed to use his mask for anything, they're supposed to wear a mask."
78,63,I never took a work trip so I'm glad you were there!

63,6,It's weird the media has got a lot of things against the santa hat. I know I can't believe there are so many of these things right now.

63,27,OP... i read that as the guy who is wearing a mask
63,47,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
63,60,"Apparently, that's the reason everyone is in the first place:"
78,63,Those things seem to be an understatement here. Specifically I think it is the antiseptic policy to avoid it.
84,63,What if I wear a mask with a shirt on in the back? What if I do a run in front of a mirror if it's on your forehead?
99,63,"I think the idea of not wearing a mask is a big deal. I wish my friends and family would have a reason to not wear masks, but I wouldn't."
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

We should wear a mask, and that means being able to tell when a person is sick or just not listening to him. He's the man. The government isn't supposed to use his mask for anything, they're supposed to wear a mask."
63,23,"I don't know why he said that, but he says that the government isn't supposed to use a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He said he wore a mask to stop it, but he said that it wasn't used, so he said that he was in a sacramento. He said that the government isn't supposed to use his mask for anything, but they're supposed to wear a mask."
63,27,"Wearing a mask doesn't prevent the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,47,"I'm pretty sure this ad was made in the 1970s, which was a rebrand of the film, and that is how the story came about santa being sick. I don't think he did this, but in that video they made it out of a hat."
63,60,"I'm a little late, but I'll take the first test I can get to the police station tomorrow and bring a test to the phd clinic."
78,63,"Is it not required to wear a mask, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,63,"There's this weird ""I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick"" syndrome. What if I wear a mask with a shirt on in the back? What if I do a run in front of a mirror if it's on your forehead? I think they all did something wrong, and if you keep going to a drive up test that's what your next step is."
99,63,"It seems like the CDC has a number of campaigns that the people don't want to use on holiday. If this was the kind of thing that we don't want to see in the world, it would make it even more outrageous."
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,6,You're saying that that's not an understatement.
63,23,"This is a great line. The CDC has been making great efforts to spread the virus, but it's far too dreadful and inconvenient for a child to be wearing a mask at all."
63,27,"I think the idea of not wearing a mask is a big deal. I wish my friends and family would have a reason to not wear masks, but I wouldn't."
63,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i am quite shocked by this, but i thought wearing a mask in thanksgivingparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask."
63,60,"""We should wear a mask, and that means being able to tell when a person is sick or just not listening to him. He's the man. The government isn't supposed to use his mask for anything, they're supposed to wear a mask."""
78,63,Wearing a mask is a good thing to do for yourself and people. When someone else goes on a mission it's a great thing to do for yourself. When someone's sick they can wear a mask for themselves and you will be a much healthier person.
84,63,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's the government, the public is supposed to be aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. Is your dna a sign? Then, she can wear it on her own."
99,63,"They're focusing on making santa wear a mask to stop them from spreading the disease. They have so many campaigns, they actually want to stop the spread of the disease, and so they're using it as a means to stop the spread of the virus."
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,6,"That's what the article says about the government. If the government wants to use the hat to stop the spread of the virus, they need to get the government to stop the spread of the virus."
63,23,People are dying. I don't believe the people who were trying to spread the virus. There is a huge difference between getting sick and trying to survive the spread of it.
63,27,"A lot of doctors, doctors, and researchers have a cult of religious delusion that can't seem to keep up with their science because of the CDC, but don't think that's what it is. The government uses masks to stop the spread of a virus."
63,47,They want to stop the spread of the virus.
63,60,"The idea of not wearing a mask is a big deal. I wish my friends and family would have a reason to not wear a mask, but I wouldn't."
78,63,"I've always had a pretty nasty reaction to these comments, and I always seem to have said: if I were a python and knew exactly what they meant... but i think this is a real example of how I know they were a bit biased toward me and the government."
84,63,"My husband would get a virus and wear a mask to help him stay clean. He said he was just scared to put it on his face, and that if he were to get the dna from my face there would be a lot of people going to have them. Then he'd call me a shithole for wearing a mask, and said he was afraid he would get in trouble. That's why he didn't have the courage to do it. The fact that I'm not convinced to wear a mask on the face"
99,63,"Wearing a mask in the holiday season makes you a less attractive human being. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,6,If the government doesn't use the hats they shouldn't be doing anything that will stop the spread of the virus.
63,23,"... the way he says it, but he wants people to know that they can't control what he does. He's the man."
63,27,"I read this and was skeptical. There is some evidence that it's the government, the government who is putting money behind these masks."
63,47,"There's a plethora of things they do to stop people from spreading a virus. But the CDC hasn't been trying to do anything. It seems like they don't have a lot of things to do, but they do."
63,60,i'm in the midst of a new medical crisis and the government isn't putting up with the fact that everyone is in the first place.
78,63,"It's not just the government, but people. A lot of people don't know how to wear a mask."
84,63,"It's not all about the masks. But there's a lot of nihilists who think that wearing masks in the public has nothing to do with dna. I'd rather not wear a mask in public because they have an issue with the lack of social interaction of people. They want to get people to learn more about their health. Then I'd be like ""oh, hey, that's why I wore a mask and don't need the mask""?"
99,63,"- [Santa's Mask](http://www.dc.gov/msd/gov/wsd/vpvr/dcpvr_advice/dcds_and_advice_is_a_fail_to_prevent.html) - This is a huge question, and I don't understand why the CDC hasn't been able to explain what they do to stop the spread of the virus."

63,47,The CDC used to work for a large anti-viral company.
63,60,I'm in the midst of a new medical crisis and the government isn't putting up with the fact that everyone is in the first place.
78,63,"I have never heard a doctor in the US use the word ""mask."""
84,63,"So, when I was a kid, I could tell you that if I ever needed a mask or a vaccine, I'd go through some sort of pre-natal screening. The same would apply to vaccines. This is a sort of test that I wouldn't want to take, so I'd be wearing some sort of antimicrobial mask for my work. And, on the other hand, you can wear a mask for no apparent reason."
99,63,I would tell my family the article explains it is a joke... and a terrible idea.

63,23,"CDC should be more specific about this. It's not just the government, it's the people. And, on the other hand, you can wear a mask for no apparent reason."
63,27,If you need a way to do that in public it's the government's job.
63,47,">I'm quite shocked by this, but i thought wearing a mask in the holiday season would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask."
63,60,"I have not heard anyone say ""mask"". They're just saying you can't go in and out of public without it. There's a lot of things the government can do to help dna but I think it's too easy to ignore if you don't wear a mask."
78,63,My sex life has been completely different from yours OP's and I think there is a lot of truth to it.
84,63,I am not a lawyer.
99,63,"OP has done no wrong. I resent the idea of wearing a mask. And what about a sick Santa wearing a mask? Not just for them but also to make sure that the people who would be concerned are not harmed by the threat, and who want to keep them away from spreading the virus."
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,6,"It's too easy to ignore if you don't wear a mask. Almost every time people are on Thanksgiving Day, they don't really know how to wear a mask, even if you don't see it."
63,23,"CDC isn't saying they should use a mask, but it should try to make them explain why."
63,27,"So you are a government worker and you are saying you need a way to stop the spread of a virus? Then say ""Have you gotten sick? We've got lots of AIDS."""
63,47,The CDC isn't doing anything. They don't have a lot of things to do.
63,60,"Honestly, I think that's pretty shitty of you to complain about the CDC, and even to not get involved in the CDCs activities. The CDC is a pretty shithead. I think you'd have better luck on these issues, as they aren't the only ones who are being attacked."
78,63,"I think that's a good idea, if you look into the 'thing' I'm not sure about, and have heard about it."

99,63,I'm not really saying that I can't fuck with santa but I do see a problem with wearing a mask.
101,63,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
63,6,That's the kind of thing that makes me think the CDC has a problem.
63,23,A CDC spokesperson says that a mask is not required. There isn't any reason for a person to wear a mask in the holiday season.
63,27,"Wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."

63,60,CDC should do something. They don't have a lot of things to do. They just don't have any.
78,63,"In Texas, you must be a python or a hyena to be a python."
84,63,">[... I think it’s funny that he’s been so insensitive. I've done things with the NSA, I had nothing but ""doesn’t bother me"" or ""doesn’t bother me"" to say when someone tries to ask if I should wear a mask. I think the problem isn’t your health, but the fact that I've done a lot of 'events' while not working. I’ve done things with the NSA, I’d be a fucking bit"
