34,21,as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports
35,21,nurse from last week thank you kira remember folks wear a mask wash your hands and stay home trying to pretend there is no problem is not a solution portland oregon
52,21,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
64,21,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
65,21,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
68,21,was behind a guy at eleven who was wearing his welders mask he could have just said i forgot it when he didn t have a face mask but instead he put others first you know what you call a person like that a patriot
73,21,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
75,21,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
83,21,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
84,21,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
87,21,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
21,11,I just wanted to point out that that the first sentence is part of the post title.
21,12,"I know this is kind of sad, but the message from this article is that, while you can't keep yourself protected, you still have to wear a mask. The fact is that the virus isn't spread by the government, it's spread by someone else, and the government has decided not to enforce it in a way that makes them more tolerant of others."
21,16,"You just said: ""It's not hard to wear a mask on a run"""
21,17,They actually want people to have a safer environment because they are uncomfortable.
34,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,21,We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks.
52,21,Well this is a really smart way to avoid getting vaccinated 
64,21,"Apparently this can be related to the 'inhibition of public use of a mask'movement, as well as the 'inhibition of government use of a mask'movement."
65,21,I hate that a virus can be easily spread without a mask. It can also be very uncomfortable. A virus will spread by itself if it is unknowingly spread through others.
68,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.was behind a guy at eleven who was wearing his welders mask
73,21,"Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park."
75,21,"A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive. And to the point where they aren’t able to control their immune system in the face of the virus or other viruses."
83,21,I read this as: “You have every right to the right to have your lungs open and your brain shut.”
84,21,Well I can help with the mask. Have a good day.
87,21,"I love the sexist fucking words but I'm not a big fan of the sexist, racist shit like that."
21,11,"This shit happens so much that if it's on a computer that's going to get sent to the local doctor to get vaccinated, that it's hard to get it."
21,12,"So, I'm in no way advocating this."
21,16,I would want to know how to wear a mask.
21,17,Then why is the government ignoring this as a means of stopping the spread of a virus?
34,21,Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because no.
35,21,They aren't allowed to do it.
52,21,"Wearing a mask outside is a great idea, but vaccinating someone in their face to help in the fight against HIV in the US doesn't sound like much of a better idea."
64,21,"Isn't that what the government wants people to wear, when they do something to prevent the spread of a virus?"
65,21,"I'm not saying you can't get a job that's nice and comfortable, but it sounds like you know a lot about the virus, so maybe you should look at the definition of comfort as well."
68,21,"Its like a CDC thing. I would not wear a mask in public unless i were in a private space with people on my phone, because they may see a face mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,21,"I would wear a mask with the venom in it while vaccinating a child, but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect. The first person person person, who is being an asshole, can never put a mask on."
75,21,"I went to the party with a mask containing the people who wouldn't wear them. They didn't care what was going on. They knew that what was going to happen would happen if they didn't get their bodies to a certain level. They also said that they'd do everything possible to prevent a pandemic. In my experience a mask, and a mask, is one thing."
83,21,Is there something to be said for a person who is in a serious state and needs a medical professional to take over or is there a government mandate for people to wear a mask?
84,21,> he was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is Well I can help with the mask. Have a good day.
87,21,"I think it's fair to say that it has something to do with the fact that if it isn't a good idea to get vaccinated and do it in public, it can be helpful in preventing the spread of other diseases. Vaccines are good for both a person and a society. Vaccines are better than not getting vaccinated."
21,11,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park. A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive."
21,12,"So a big fat fat man just wanted to tell a guy he did not want to be the president of the world, and that he could be the head of a federal agency. The government will never enact a law that is a bit too'sexist' to be an effective one."
21,16,"It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes."
21,17,"It's because the government believes that public health is important in keeping a people at risk in a safe environment. But, no. I've been here. I was just going to say the same thing if you were me I would want to know how to wear a mask. Have a good day."
34,21,You should be wearing a mask and using the same slack that the CDC is using to stop the spread of a virus.
35,21,I'm not a nurse. But this isn't a solution to a problem. I am talking about something more important to me than a virus. The thing I want to do is to look out for you.
52,21,It sounds like you're gonna be a bit of a dick here. The government is gonna do something about it.
64,21,I've been a part of a campaign where people get the impression that the 'government' is the only viable solution to prevent people from getting sick.
65,21,"Well, there is a huge difference between ""not wearing a mask to protect yourself from HIV, but ""wearing a mask and survive than contract the virus."""
68,21,This guy is a patriot. He deserves to be seen with a face mask.
73,21,"I would be wearing a mask in public but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect. The first person person person person person, who is being an asshole, can never put a mask on. I see what you mean, but how do you think he is being condescending and dick-faced person. It sounds like you have a lot to hide."
75,21,I think the first thing we want to do is be more proactive about the anti-vaccination movement.
83,21,I don't know about the government but that's something you can get by just watching TV.
84,21,It's a good thing that we have such a bad system of communication and a bad public image. The issue is with the perception of the mask.
87,21,"Well, you're not a doctor, but a doctor with a viral infection that is not a known problem. It's not that you should vaccinate someone. There are some reasons why people will do that, but this isn't really an issue that you should be vaccinating. It's not a problem in the least, it's a problem for everyone."
21,11,The NSA and the government are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
21,12,"> I would wear a mask with the venom in it while vaccinating a child, but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect."
21,16,"I'm a nurse and I have had my fair share of problems with a virus in the past, which is why I think it is a good idea to wear a mask when i get sick."
21,17,"I don't think this is a good idea to say, but I do think that if a public health professional was entrusted with that job and would be able to help, they would be better off using that job instead."
34,21,That is exactly what the article was supposed to say.
35,21,I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus.
52,21,I've been doing it since I was about 9 and my eyes were red and I'm going to feel like that's all. That's all. It sounds like you're gonna be a bit of a dick here. The government is gonna do something about it. I think we're on the same page here.
64,21,I really love you. Have a good day!
65,21,"I'm not sure what that means in any way, but there's a difference between not wearing a mask and being a part of the government. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. It's just that some people tend to put on a mask just because of the 'right' of being a part of the government. They want it to stop the spread of a virus, even if they feel comfortable."
68,21,"Unless you want to be a patriot and it sounds like they are, then it's not a patriot."
73,21,What did the article say? How many people is there to know that he's a dickhead?
75,21,They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about.
83,21,"I was able to go into the ER today and it looked like my asthma was going to go away. It was so bad, but not as bad."
84,21,The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people wearing it. That's what has been discussed a lot here.
87,21,"As a doctor, I'm not vaccinated."
21,11,It's about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.
21,12,You think that he is going to be a dickhead? He sounds like a weirdo.
21,16,"I'm not a doctor. I'm a nurse. I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
21,17,What if I said that the doctor was a dickhead?
34,21,> We need a better solution to a disease like papilloma.
35,21,It was a bit inflammatory. It was the kind of joke that made me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago.
52,21,"So the ""intentional anti-roosefooting"" thing is still an issue to debate but still the same? Unless you're really a virus user, then you're a virus."
64,21,"> Apparently this can be related to the 'inhibition of public use of a mask'movement, as well as the 'inhibition of government use of a mask'movement."
65,21,"> if I wear a mask and it is about stopping the spread of the virus, then it isn't so bad. You can wear whatever it is that makes you feel good about myself, you don't need to wear the mask."
68,21,He's just a patriot and I don't think he can be in a position to become a patriot.
73,21,"This is the one where I think that the government is inefficient. If the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of AIDS, then I think it is an exaggeration."
75,21,I'm a doctor and wear a mask. I am a doctor.
83,21,"You're going to have to look pretty damn good with your doctor's help to figure out how to use a mask. Getting a mask is a good idea, but you don't necessarily want to wear it, if it's a non-emergency plan."
84,21,It's also a sign of an unsanitary public environment.
87,21,You haven't said anything good about wearing a mask.
21,11,I was a doctor and always tried to wear a mask because I wanted to see what I could see. Then when I tried to get vaccinated they went back to the doctor to explain. So I said that to the doctor and then asked him for a prescription to get vaccinated. I also said that I tried to get a prescription on my own when I had already started and was told that it was because I didn't think about a prescription. They said they were essentially saying I had an asthma attack.
21,12,"''The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.""''"
21,16,">I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
21,17,"As a child, I felt this way about getting a doctor to help me. The doctors are the only people in the community to do their part."
34,21,"There are a lot of pranks that are in the CDC, they do not use them, and there are people who do."
35,21,I think this is what a lot of people are saying.
52,21,"I am not sure who is trying to use the word ""trick"" with the NSA. I would just call it ""trick""."
64,21,> I am a little sad that I was the first person to be able to get vaccinated by wearing a mask.
65,21,"I read this as, a joke Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.My husband would do it with me and be wearing a mask. I would wear a mask in the hospital. I'm a medical professional. I think the best way to prevent people from getting virus from your home is to wear a mask at all times. I think it is nice that they are doing what the government is doing and say they are not working, but not that they are doing it anyway."
68,21,"People that are crazy can be crazy if they wear masks. They can just look at someone as strange, but it sounds like a very simple thing to do to a crazy person."
73,21,"I didn't mean to insult or deny that they're working to stop AIDS. I meant to say that it's a problem, but not a joke."
75,21,"I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma is."
83,21,I'm a very large physician and have been wearing a mask for many years. I also don't believe that medical aid is really a viable option in the long run. Is there a difference between a mask and a vaccine?
84,21,"The way people are treating people is a bit confusing, huh? The fact that you guys are still working at the government and you're also wearing masks is a little shady, because if you're in a hurry they can't see you. There are some serious shady people who are willing to give someone a mask just to keep them away."
87,21,"I'm not saying that I have a right to vaccinat people. But I think I have a right to do so. I think I've said something good about doing so, but I don't think it would be right for everyone to think that I should go outside and get vaccinated unless they're sick. I would do so in public because I would not mind that, because they don't have authority on the vaccine and I don't think I'm in the minority."
21,11,"> ""The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it."""
21,12,"I mean, I feel like you might have been going from being a doctor to being a medical professional to trying to force the people to give a shit about it."
21,16,">I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."", "">I'm not a doctor. I'm a nurse. I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
21,17,"Yes! And the best way to prevent the spread of the virus from being in your house is to take a mask on yourself. That's one way you can stop the spread of AIDS, and that's another way you can get some of the most expensive drugs available."
34,21,"This is a lot like the CDC's memo that says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" It says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" But there is nothing to the joke that says ""Pah-ph-ah-ph-h-ph-ph-md."
35,21,""" I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not just about the mask, it's about how people in the military and private sector can feign the need to knowingly become people who don't have a mask. I think people don't understand why people don't want to wear a mask."
52,21,"""What's the best way to prevent infection with the AIDS virus if you have no ear, you're not going to be a good person by wearing a mask""."
64,21,"I like the wording. If it was a joke, then I'd be ok with wearing a mask."
65,21,"I'm a doctor and I wear a mask to protect myself from HIV. I've never seen anyone that wears them in public. I feel that wearing a mask is good for them. I don't think it's a good idea. I'm not sure what the term ""a mask"" is for, but that's just a phrase."
68,21,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
73,21,"Apparently, the CDC has been doing the same thing with the HIV and THC treatment."
75,21,I don't know what a prank is. And I'm not a doctor.
83,21,So you want to protect yourself from getting sick?
84,21,I don't even know why the first paragraph is downvoted. I really need to read that. And you know what?
87,21,There is not a difference between wearing a mask and an AIDS virus.
21,11,CANNOTANSWER : The CDC and the NSA are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
21,12,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
21,16,"This is a funny way to say something to a sick person. That is what it is, but that is what people in the US are doing."
21,17,"What a joke. I was told to tell my husband to ""buy a mask""."
34,21,I like how they're going to make this a lot of jokes because it's like they have been using a mask for so long that they will never get a response.
35,21,"It's really weird. I think people don't understand why people don't want to wear a mask. It's really weird, it is a joke."
52,21,There's a thing called a mask to combat infection.
64,21,> The only thing I know is that I'm a man and the people I know are in the middle of a conversation about it. What are you talking about?
65,21,That's not how a prank works.
68,21,It's a political thing and is not a government thing.
73,21,"I'm not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar. If I were you, I'd give the CDC a visit. But I'm not a dickhead, I'm a veb."
75,21,"Those are good terms to use here, but you can't be sure. They're not a joke."
83,21,I've read several t-shirts and I just wanted to say you're right.
84,21,">You guys are not a lawyer, and you guys are not a lawyer."
87,21,The government is working to save the world.
21,11,Why would someone buy a mask if they already had a mask?
21,12,">I am not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar."
21,16,"I know some people who aren't going to be as close to an AIDS patient as I am. My husband does the same thing, but without a mask, and I don't know what he's talking about."
21,17,"I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a lawyer. The government is working to save the world."
34,21,"If someone has a sick person in their family, it is a prank."
35,21,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm just in that room. I really am not. I have a problem, I can't answer the phone in the morning."
52,21,What you see here is the part where people wear a mask in the face of a virus they are trying to protect themselves.
64,21,"That's like saying, ""I like the wording. If it was a joke, then I'd be ok with wearing a mask."""
65,21,"It's a joke if you are a doctor. I don't know why anyone would say this, but it's a joke."
68,21,"It has been around for a long time, and I can't stand it if we continue to see it being worn by people. It's not my opinion that we should wear a mask in every emergency or that we should prevent it from spreading."
73,21,Isn't it really a joke about that? I'm not sure what the fuck this guy is saying because he just isn't making it up.
75,21,I think you're overly critical of CDC.
83,21,I'm not a doctor but I am a huge medical professional who has a lot of experience with the treatment of infectious disease. It is possible for anyone that is in an emergency to do what is necessary to save them.
84,21,"The most annoying part of the joke is that people on reddit are still not allowed to wear masks, which is probably a big enough issue to make this sub sub feel like it's a joke."
87,21,"This is a very good point, and it's a pretty good one."
21,11,It's not a joke because the CDC and NSA are both at fault here.
21,12,That is a joke. It is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. It is not a joke.
21,16,A joke. Not a joke. A joke.
21,17,There's always a place for the truth... but that's just a joke!
34,21,I know a lot of people who wear masks but they don't want to get into the hands of the people they want to prevent a pandemic.
35,21,Vaccinations are not the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
52,21,It's not a joke. It's a fact. It's a fact.
64,21,I don't know what to write about this but I'm really curious what they think the purpose of masks is in general.
65,21,I believe the problem isn't that people aren't aware how HIV is spread and people that don't know about it.
68,21,"... and I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask"
73,21,I'm so incredibly uncomfortable with this guy...
75,21,">Can't be a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean'."
83,21,Are you joking? :(
