31,26,"I'm a nurse, and I don't like wearing masks, but I think it's funny that someone says this one a couple of times on tv."
35,31,I'm a nurse and this is a legitimate topic... what do you mean? The government uses masks to prevent spread of a virus in the USA.
39,31,I do not believe in a mask.
42,31,"It's kinda funny how so many people are using the term 'wearing a mask' to mean ""wearing a mask"" - it's called something like ""wearing a mask and if you can get vaccinated"""
46,31,I know how that works but if I wear a mask to protect myself or someone I haven't met with if I see them get sick I have no idea what I'm doing.
61,31,The best way to get to the grocery store is to find a flier on the other side of town that has the flier and leave you alone. It's a good way to go about it.
65,31,So you said you would be too uncomfortable to wear a mask. What you were doing is perfectly fine.

101,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,22,"Why are these people being jerks? I mean, that's ridiculous. But I do think the government really believes in that."
31,26,"This is a good question. The question you asked, ""I don't wear a mask because I'm afraid I can't do it because I think it's a bad idea, but I like wearing a mask so I can get vaccinated and be more comfortable""."
35,31,The US government is a bit over the top. Its not like it is doing any good in its own right. They're all part of the government's health care infrastructure.
39,31,"I mean it does, but there are a lot of people that think that the government has any interest in helping stop the spread of a virus."
42,31,"Because it's not a thing, it's the government's policy."

61,31,I'm assuming that he is in a bad position. He is wearing a mask. But I'm not sure.
65,31,> I like the whole idea of masks. I just hate the whole idea of masks. I think I would have a good time with them. I’ve seen people that wore them before and I figured there would be a problem.
82,31,I would be able to do my job without the government trying to stop it. The first part of that quote was pretty bad.
85,31,Why are people so hard on a person like the guy?
90,31,"It's very funny. It's easy to put on a slapstick mask to annoy people, but it's really just a way of letting you know that a slapstick mask is more important than any other sort of ottomatic thing. The problem here isn't that you should tell someone how to do it, but that you're just letting it slip when they're trying to keep from telling you what they're doing while it's on and it isn't even going to be that. If they're trying"
101,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,22,My father works in a hospital. He was a nurse in the hospital. He had never been in a medical emergency before. He would put on a mask to try and annoy people.
31,26,"It's the government's business. But you've been out of the country, and you don't have a job that is more important than theirs. You can't wear a mask to protect yourself, or if you do, you can't wear a mask."
35,31,"I'm an American nurse, and I'm just not sure what it's worth anymore, but a mask should really be a safety feature."
39,31,"I don't think if you wear a mask and it stops a virus, you are in the minority."
42,31,"People in this sub tend to think that if the government decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it. In my experience, if a doctor decided to vaccinate a child he could easily have an infection. I would not vaccinate a child with HIV unless the doctor decided to make it a ""prisonable"" situation."
46,31,"I don't know if you are being a complete asshole and don't even know how you can make a joke out of it - it's not that funny to me. It's also not that the government has a legitimate reason to not use this - it's just that they are trying to degrade the human population, that's just wrong."
61,31,"I don't understand how people can even take that as an issue that is the main issue with having a mask. The same can be said about being able to get the vaccine by wearing a mask (I'm not even sure if that's the problem) and being able to go through a quarantine. If you aren't able to get a vaccine, I feel that you would be able to get the vaccine in a way that does not allow you to take a rash or be able to fucking around with a mask."
65,31,"I can't speak for others, but I don't understand why someone would assume someone would wear a mask if they did so, so that they might feel more comfortable doing it."
82,31,Its a little of both.
85,31,The vebb was originally bred in the US. It was renamed as a vebb in the US.
90,31,"I am not a doctor, so I don't think it's much better for them to just take the slapstick on and do the pranks with the mask they're being given. It may not be as bad as you think, but it is an excellent way to look at the idea."
101,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,22,They're referring to the government's policy.
31,26,"I know it is a sexist comment, but I wouldn't say it's funny. I don't like being told about something that isn't the norm and not the government's business, but rather to say I don't wear a mask at all, since I'm actually pretty fucking unfriendly to it. It's not a joke, but it's just a way to be polite, I don't think it's funny."
35,31,"I'm pretty sure the government is an illegal force that can't be beaten up. This is just a form of a ""fuck that's a fuck that shit thing"" and I don't care."
39,31,"In Texas there is a Christmas mask that is called ""the Christmas mask"" and it is designed to prevent the spread of a virus. It has been around for a decade now and it's the only way to get to someone who is sick, a mask is necessary. It's used for several purposes - to get someone to get to them by visiting a doctor or using a full face mask for a fever, or as a way to give them a reminder that they are sick and not in a situation to save them. It has been doing it for nearly half a"

46,31,"I think the point is that if we put a mask on people who are sick and sick because we were wearing one, it could help to stop it from spreading. A python's head, with a mask is probably not worth wearing."
61,31,"I thought the first sentence meant that you were a child, and a guy. He was not."
65,31,"I think it is nice that they are doing what the government is doing and say they are not working, but not that they are doing it anyway."
82,31,"This is going to turn people into pricks who are trying to get their jobs back, and then they realize they are not doing the right thing. I've snooped too."
85,31,"There is a lot to say here, and there are people who actually believe that it's dangerous for their dogs. I would like to know more about this."
90,31,Is it a joke? That's what you're telling me. You're telling it.

31,26,"... But what if someone was being very disrespectful, even when they were telling you this?"
35,31,"I don't know why but I guess the one I've read isn't really going to get any attention. I'm just saying that the ""Filming a Mask"" thing seems very inflammatory because it's a joke."
39,31,What are they supposed to wear for a birthday? That mask would help me protect myself in case of a pandemic. I could see it happening now.
42,31,This is a very big thing.
46,31,>Why is it the government's job to give people a mask in public?
61,31,"I think that the first sentence is ""I don't think it's a joke, I think it's the NSA's job to protect us from infection and he's wearing a mask."""
65,31,Is there anything wrong with a mask?
82,31,[The first part is the omission of the quote. I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a life jacket.

35,31,"OP... I want to see how the CDC and government policy can have such a ""no problem"" attitude when dealing with what the people who do not have the right to a vaccinated person. I'd be so mad at that. The truth is that it's in some ways a joke."
39,31,"...which I'm not sure why the guy that's wearing a mask doesn't want to support my own health care choices, he just wants to fight for the good of all Americans."
42,31,"This is a big thing. People aren't just asking to put out a mask, they are requesting to be vaccinated to prevent a viral outbreak, and a few of them are asking for a medical exemption. You can't do this without being vaccinated. That's not the issue. People do not just think a mask is a good idea. People do not vaccinate themselves. But there are people who don't think a mask is a good idea."
46,31,"We can't live without being stung by a virus.... It's not just a ""savage"" message. It's a message in a really short way. If you don't know where the term for it is from, then it's going to be very confusing. I can't imagine why I don't get the ""savage"" feeling I'm getting."
61,31,You're doing a horrible job.
65,31,"[I’ve never read a single piece of written literature where people can’t be bothered to wear a mask in public. But I did read the article, and I can tell you from experience that some people would be very happy with a mask. They want to help people prevent AIDS, because that is exactly what you said. I'm a doctor and I have a lot of experience with doctors in the hospital, where I try to protect myself, but I feel that when I don’t have a properly fitted mask I tend to wear it. I think the best way to prevent"

31,22,"In the world of health care, it is mandatory that people get vaccinated."
31,26,The 'why is it a joke' thing is very common and in a lot of countries this is considered as a joke.
35,31,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is a form of protection to protect against any potential spread of a virus. A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."
39,31,"The CDC is doing something completely different to the other ""warning"" parts of the story."
42,31,">The problem is with people who think that people shouldn't be able to wear a mask. That's just how things are done. People aren't just asking to put out a mask, they are requesting to be vaccinated to prevent a viral outbreak, and a few of them are asking for a medical exemption."

61,31,"As a father to a child, I was told that I needed to wear a mask to protect me from infection and shit. Despite my ignorance of it, I didn't like to have a cigarette. I was more worried that I was in a coma than I did about it being a joke. But after a while I really figured out it wasn't even for me. Eventually I realized I couldn't make a joke and my mind immediately started going to that mask and shit. I was a little infuriated with how"
65,31,"When the government isn't actually doing any kind of things it's the ""government"" who have to pay for a mask, and the governmental isn't really looking at it to the benefit of the person. It's just an attempt to make things that are actually helpful to people. The only things they can do to improve public safety are put down."

101,31,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,22,"This is a really great post, but I think there is some really useful information here. One thing that comes to mind is that a virus is not really a virus. Vaccination is used as a form of protection against most of those. There is also a big reason why people are so critical to peoples health and safety in many countries."
31,26,This is one of those things where the government is essentially trying to hide its 'taylorville' mentality.
35,31,"I'm not sure why a mask should be a safety feature, but I'd be so mad at that. It's a joke. I think it's a joke."
39,31,It's possible that there is a virus in the CDC that it's an attack on public health.
42,31,There is an article on reddit recently called 'Making me wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus' and it's the most revealing thing that's ever happened to me.
46,31,"So I'm saying that we need to do the same to make people invent vaccines. We can do the same, but we need to do more and more to prevent people from getting sick, so this may or may not be a good option for people with some type of sickness. And maybe some people who would not be immune to a virus can be cured from it."
61,31,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, and a joke. It's a joke."
65,31,"What a prank. It's a joke. I'm sorry. You're just trying to get people to think this way, but that's not how people behave. They're acting like an idiot for having a prank. It's their own job to help them with their job. They're not actually doing anything wrong. The people who aren't using the prank to get the people to think this way. That's ridiculous. They're not even allowed to have people who wear masks."

31,22,"I'm just trying to get a little more clear - there is a bit of an 'I'm really mad at this prank.' I'm not even sure why people are putting off this joke, I just want a bit more information, I don't think I'd make a joke about this, because I've learned to talk with my parents and their parents about it."
31,26,The prank that I thought was funny and not funny and not about the government is a joke.
35,31,"Its a joke, and a joke."
39,31,"Yes, I’m surprised that this is such a popular response. I am also shocked that the people who wear a mask on their birthdays are the only ones who actually wear a mask."

46,31,There's a huge difference between wearing a mask and not getting sick or not getting sick.
61,31,"There are a lot of jokes about a CIA worker wearing a mask because of a false idea, but that's all a joke about the CIA. The CIA isn't trying to do anything with the virus, it's trying to make a point of the idea, and people have to be careful when it comes to it. Is this a joke? Mostly because you're trying to convince someone to not wear a mask if they don't want to be hurt."
65,31,I think it’s interesting that a bunch of this pranks are so silly it’s hardly funny.
82,31,It's a joke about a prick. The pricks probably don't know how to do that and do it in front of their bosses.
