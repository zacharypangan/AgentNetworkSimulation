37,36,"There is not much they can do about the cost of vaccines, but it does give you a lot of information about statewide mask mandates."
51,36,It is not just a thing. It is a policy of the government that the people are vaccinated with. And what I like to hear is that the government is making a mask to stop the spread of HIV.

This includes all the people who don't know who they have, those who do, and those who don't care about them. Then again, this post is full of the same ideas people get."
87,36,I just got back from a trip to the states and they said that you are wearing a mask outside when you are vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.

91,36,This is the best place to tell a story.
93,36,"Twas a very good point about the whole people being out there, and there was a great example of that. I don t think people are oblivious to this, but the people in the US have a long history of wearing masks. So it makes sense, but I think it ruins the entire concept."

37,36,"And yet, she is wearing her mask on the day of her birthday, so..."
51,36,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated helps stop the spread of a virus.
54,36,I see why a lot of people are confused about this. What you're describing seems like an entirely separate issue with the government.
67,36,I'm on a mission to the U.S. It is a good idea.
81,36,"I wear a mask to protect other people, but I can't see the link because I couldn't find the link. :("
85,36,Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,36,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something."
89,36,"They also use a mask to cover their ears, which is a common symptom of coronavirus infection. It makes a nice little hat."
90,36,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,36,I don't know about anyone who carries a face mask.
93,36,I like that it's the same type of person in the media who wears a mask all the time in the community.
95,36,"Vaccination isn't supposed to be a right and wrong thing to do when kids need to go vaccinated for a specific health condition. It can be done, however, when the children aren't healthy enough. I would suggest that you get tested for HIV at a community college and get your child tested. You don't have to do this because you have no health insurance."
99,36,I don't understand why people would think such a thing and say that this is a bad idea unless someone is trying to change their mind.
100,36,"People who don't know what a walking mask is, are really strange. I don't know what the definition of a ""walking mask"" is, but I think this is what people say. There are actually people who are so very, very strange and strange that they think they are very cool."
37,36,"It sounds like you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not. This is not a government-funded initiative, it is part of the government-funded initiative. It's more like a federal health care system, or a state based one."
51,36,I'm a big gamer. I'm not a man.
54,36,"No. My mom is from Florida. She runs a marathon every Friday night, and I'm so scared of the CDC and the CDC...but you have to run for 30 miles!"
67,36,> Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
81,36,In the UK you can't buy a mask for the purpose of keeping people safe if you have a friend or family member.
85,36,"That's a good question to ask. The article is so long, it's almost as if it's a joke and it's not the only one to get a good laugh."
87,36,"""I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job."""
89,36,"I just think it's kinda funny that a large percentage of the commenters in here are trying to explain why they are using a different type of mask to get a shave. There may be a lot more than this, but if the author wanted to explain that it wasn't the same thing as the original post, he would probably just have had no problem at all with the comment."
90,36,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm from Oregon. I have been there a few times. I have worn the mask several times over the years. It's a really good excuse to do the dirty work.
91,36,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""

99,36,I agree. A little weird that if you like this movie then go watch it.
100,36,"I know some people who do that, but I don't know where the term is originally from. I know the description for it is a little bit misleading."
37,36,"The statewide mask mandate seems very important to me. I'm not a lawyer, but my wife's mother is."

We have a new policy against wearing a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most"
54,36,There's also a separate section that says it's a way to stop the spread of mumps. The wikipedia article makes a point that it's not the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
67,36,"It's hard to believe that everyone isn't willing to be vaccinated because it is necessary to prevent people from getting sick and getting infected, and that a few people who are willing to not be vaccinated by the law aren't going to be able to vaccinate the rest of their family, and that a lot of people who don't want to have their hands tied aren't going to be able to afford a vaccinate because they do not feel safer."
81,36,"If you want to have this issue with your life, you can, but you have to be very careful. I wear a mask on Christmas and am working hard to make sure everyone else is safe, and that is a bit more than that."
85,36,The hivemind that created the dog is not in the picture.
87,36,"This is a rant, not a joke. It's an honest conversation."
89,36,">""We are not going to stop the spread of the virus in the morning"" is a bad analogy because the word you use in the first paragraph was taken from an article in an article about a very, very well known virus, which is actually a joke."
90,36,Is this a video that we have no idea where to start? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,36,"If you don't wear a mask that will keep the virus away from the public, don't bother, the public can't be a safe environment, and the government isn't going to get involved."
93,36,"You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
95,36,"If it doesn't happen, we can't make them wear that mask."
99,36,The CDC has a number of campaigns that the people don't want to use on holiday.

It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,36,It sounds like he's trying to help people get vaccines and not do it. He's trying to help people get the vaccine. He's trying to get the vaccines but he's not a lawyer. He's trying to work on a project that involves working on a vaccine but doesn't really help a little.
51,36,I can't think of anything wrong with this.
54,36,The reason why wearing a mask is being promoted is that it's used as an excuse for people that can't be vaccinated.
67,36,People who aren't vaccinated are on a mission.
81,36,"I love being a doctor - I've been a doctor in my life and I wear a mask a lot. The only time I feel like that is on Christmas and the joke's on my bday, I wear a mask because the person I'm talking about is on Christmas, and I don't feel like my parents would care enough to tell me what to do with the money they're spending on me. It's a nice idea, though."
85,36,I'm gonna say something along the lines of:
87,36,>Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
89,36,"I have to agree with you in a bit of a ways, but in this case it’s a joke that can work. I mean I want a good hat and I can get a decent headshot with a mask, but I don’t want to put the head up on my head and make a mess."
90,36,"Honestly, it's pretty normal. It's a little different than a lot of those, but it's very common."
91,36,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn't interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
93,36,"In all fairness, this a joke, but it's a joke, and it makes sense."

99,36,I don't see how anything that's funny or funny is a good idea.

I know the description for it is a little bit misleading....I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading."
37,36,It doesn't address the issue. It's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence.
51,36,"There's a big difference between a mask and a real person, and a real person can be a python to the extent that it's part of a mask, as long as you're not the one causing the virus."
54,36,"It's not about whether or not it's a good idea, it's about how government and private entities create and protect their own people."
67,36,"In the states with the highest rates of vaccination for vaccines, vaccines and ebola vaccines are allowed at the hospital. I would recommend an outside vaccinate, if you're not vaccinated. It would be easier to do your own research and not rely on some one's judgement, which would also work in the field."
81,36,"I am in the UK, and I would recommend this article to anyone interested in HIV testing."
85,36,"I'm sorry you're being disrespectful. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry it was a joke."
87,36,"Why do you hate ranting about the government? You're a doctor and if you don't know how to be a good human being, you will likely end up in the middle of a rant about something you don't think is a good idea. I'm sorry, but there are many people out there who might also want to know what's going on."
89,36,"I've done a lot of this before. I don't really care about your health, it's just a fun idea."
90,36,"This is what a lot of people feel, in real life. It's not a joke or a joke but something else."
91,36,"I've never heard a person say this: I don't think he's a python, but I've gotten a lot of advice on how to prevent a virus."
93,36,"The idea that people wear masks in the wiki article hasn't been considered ""so far"" from the actual facts, but rather, just ""they"" are more accurate than the media is going to make it sound."
95,36,"My wife's mom always says that she is not able to make a decent living while wearing a mask, so the idea of wearing a mask is pretty interesting. Her comment is really interesting and my husband doesn't make a shit bit of sense of what she's wearing, so she wears a mask and bends over a mask and bends over a mask and bends over a mask and bends over over a mask and bends over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and"
99,36,I've been wearing a mask for the past two years and I love to wear it.
100,36,People can't be infected when they wear a mask. They are trying to show their ineptitude to other people through the world. The difference is that a mask is more important than knowing a person's place of existence.
37,36,"> Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past. This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign."
51,36,"[Porn is a non -committal form of narcotics, and the government isn't going to do any good in trying to combat this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotics_Female-Cancer-Virus-Communicatio_Ranges/index.php)"
54,36,">He doesn't have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
67,36,"""A lot of this is funny, because the CDC isn't going to give you any reason to be offended at that. It's the best way to save the world. Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated. It's not ""just part of the"" problem, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated. It's not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
81,36,This is so fucked up. We're in the middle of a major crisis. The US government is trying to get rid of the CDC's shit-shit. The federal government isn't about preventing it.
85,36,"I've got a little bit to go for but I've already made a big effort to be a positive influence and help the dogs. I can't be bothered to write or talk about that on this sub. My wife is a bit of a fucking freak and I need to get back into the know and do something. But I am willing to make a statement about the NSA, especially since you've already been through the NSA. I'm so sorry it's a joke and a joke!"
87,36,>I'm a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
89,36,"A lot of the people who take part in this thread are really just curious because their thoughts aren't that relevant anymore. What's it that sucks, is that they don't really understand what they're talking about."
90,36,i don't think it's funny. I think it's funny to tell people that i'm not really a virus person
91,36,"if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible"
93,36,So the story goes like this: People with a mask are wearing masks to help ward off the virus.
95,36,"It's a slew of words – ',"
99,36,"> In my experience, people who buy masks don't even wear masks for the holidays. In fact they do make it easier to get away from the virus, which they can't avoid at all."
100,36,"I can't imagine what that means when it comes to the idea of wearing a mask, but if you can't tell how many times you are wearing a mask when you are in an area where you can't tell what a python is you may need a mask. It's more like saying ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
37,36,I'm not sure how people get away with a nice one:
51,36,So this isn't just a joke.
54,36,The guy has to wear a mask for a number of reasons:
67,36,"Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there's no moral requirement to make the person who isn't vaccinated be vaccinated."
81,36,"You're referring to a joke and not the CDC, the CDC's policy."
85,36,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus."", ""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it. No, it’s not funny."

90,36,"The prank doesn't work, the prank just doesn't come close to it. It's like people aren't getting the chance to be funny, but they are putting a prank on people and pranking them, and they are pranking each other."
91,36,"""Won't a NSA agent wear a mask for you to be sick?"""
93,36,"I was gonna say a little to the effect of ""Use a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I would say this isn't the correct response."""

54,36,I'm going to run this for fun.
67,36,"As long as you wear a mask and don't get infected by AIDS virus, that's still a good idea."
81,36,"As someone who has a VERY HIFI-prone wife, I'm so relieved."
85,36,I'm not going to try to explain it for you. I'm going to make a post about a dog named 'James' in which I'm an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human.
87,36,I've gotten my shit together and they all look like idiots. They all have shit together and troll posts to tell them why they can't go to the doctor.
89,36,"The CDC is focusing on stopping the spread of a virus.It's not a joke, it's a prank, it's a prank."
90,36,a prank is about the fact that he is a good person and not a doctor.
91,36,>It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
93,36,>I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.

99,36,This has been written a few times. There's really nothing they can do about it. People don't need a mask for the holidays. It's a little 'just the way people dress for Christmas' type thing.
100,36,You think a mask is a bad idea?
37,36,Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,36,A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus.
54,36,"This is a great idea, although you might be misinformed."
67,36,The US gov't needs to enforce the laws. I'm not sure where you're coming from.
81,36,"The article says that the CDC isn't doing it, and so there is a lot of talk about it."
85,36,"I think a lot of the people that write this can't do it, but my husband and I've done all we can to help the dogs."
87,36,"Vaccination is the worst vaccination possible, unless it's in fact a non-higgins virus. Vaccination is the worst."
89,36,I think I read the whole thing. It doesn't make sense to me.
90,36,So what's the point of the prank? I like to run a prank because I like my friends and my business and that's when they prank.
91,36,"I like how the government acts like a parasite. You can’t just stop an irrational horde from spreading it. You have to get out the door and wear a mask - you can’t even try to stop them in the middle of the night - and be a jerk, but the NSA isn’t taking the threat if they don’t prevent it. I don’t want to give you any idea if the NSA is going to go after you because you can’t fucking safe environment without one."
93,36,"I've learned that most of this stuff comes from the ""people"" of the United States. They use the words ""fucking things"" and ""so-and-so"" and the ""what ifs"" when referring to people who wear masks. So, it's interesting that people are being manipulated."
95,36,You're wearing a mask
99,36,"No, I didn't. And no, I was not being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, as usual, as I'm just saying that there's a big gap between wearing and being sick. People shouldn't wear masks, it doesn't look good or good or healthy. And I don't see how a good thing that is actually made, especially when the sick person does it, is a bad idea."
100,36,I was in a similar situation. The thing was more about a python costume.
