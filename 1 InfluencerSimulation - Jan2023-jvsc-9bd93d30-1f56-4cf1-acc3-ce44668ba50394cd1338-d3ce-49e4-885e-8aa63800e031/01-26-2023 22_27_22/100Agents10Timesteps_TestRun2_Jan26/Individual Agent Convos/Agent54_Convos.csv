76,54,This is my favorite troll post ever. What kind of guy is this and is a joke?
83,54,"Honestly, I agree with you on the mask, but the people in the US still don't get this message, so we're going to have to stick to them and the people in tight settings."
89,54,"I'm trying to go, but I need to try a running mask and make sure it's not a mask, that doesn't really work."

54,1,Why are you being downvoted for being too hard on myself? What's the matter?
54,10,"It's not a joke, it's the joke. And you should know that it's not a joke."
54,12,I don't know about a lot of the people in this thread who didn't realize the point of the 'distraction' from the first post.
54,17,"It's true. In the US, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus. Why do people use a mask, I don't see a problem with it. Wearing a mask and keeping distance is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

54,23,"I was reading that as a kid. I have a ton of money to make, but it seems like that's not exactly the sort of thing you can make out of it. You should just tell yourself if you feel like your troll post is being a troll, it's a great thing you read about it!"
54,28,"He doesn't want the word'safety' out there because it's so threatening a person who is actually infected, and that he is a virologist. This is not a joke."
54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,33,"I'm trying to go, but I need to try a running mask and make sure it's not a mask, that doesn't really work."
54,34,"IMO you should wear a mask for a long run, because you can do it with a lot of help, not for the whole run. If you're not comfortable with it, then wear a mask."
54,35,So it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,36,I see why a lot of people are confused about this. What you're describing seems like an entirely separate issue with the government.
54,43,"Oh ok, here's a joke, he's running with the dog."
54,45,"Hey, here we go... I've never heard of this before."

This guy is just a troll. He's so stupid he couldn't even stand that one."
55,54,"I think the government is trying to get more attention into the issue, and I think it is unfair to assume that ""not wearing a mask on your face in public can help you stop the spread of a virus."""

100,54,I don't think there is any reason for you to wear a mask as a means of trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus.

A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."

55,54,I have a friend who has done this to me. He's also the person who always asks me to wear a mask. He was the one who thought it would help him. It sounded like his face was being thrown at him. He didn't care and I had to get vaccinated.

100,54,Is the idea of a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,1,"I don't think this is a really bad thing because there are many people who will go on holiday with a mask and ask for a good mask because they think it will prevent a virus from spreading. But, when you're able to get a vaccination with a mask you're able to stay home with other people, so if you have to leave and need to stay a little more to stay healthy you can be out there a little less. It's kind of a joke."
54,10,It's an interesting fact that I have a lot of respect for the president of my country because he is very much a troll. Especially the ones that are in the position to go after him with the same excuse.

54,17,"It is a common issue in the United States to use a mask, in a similar fashion to the Vaccines for the Infectious Diseases (Mumps).

54,49,This is the 'advice' for your comment.
55,54,"I think the whole concept of a mask is a little old. We could just tell that it might be an acceptable excuse or something. Then, maybe, one day the doctors at the school that isn't going to be taking part in the pandemic will realize it's not in your family, and put them on the meds to take care of their own health and provide for them.

54,34,You guys are shady.
54,35,"My husband and I wear the masks. It’s a restraining order that’s enforced at home, preventing the spread of any type of disease, and preventing the spread of a large number of potentially fatal mumps."

54,43,Wearing a mask as a means of trying to stop the spread of a virus.
54,45,"It's infringing on the public health of people who are already getting infected and people who don't know about it. It would be inappropriate to ignore the public health risks involved and if the government had to provide it, if they didn't, they wouldn't have been so concerned."
54,47,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
54,49,I think people need to be informed that the government isn't doing enough to help the people who are getting sick. The CDC and NIH aren't doing enough to do enough to protect children from a virus. I think a mask is a good thing.
55,54,I'm an Atheist and I've seen many cases of people wearing a mask. That's part of why people don't get vaccinated.
59,54,"This is the one that made me really wonder, was it a ""Damn it! We got vaccinated now!"
67,54,"I was asked this last weekend by a girl in a psych class for ""Cannomena's Disease"" and she told me that ""I don't know what a mask is, and I don't think it's necessary to wear it as a reason to be vaccinated, I'm not going to make any decisions about whether to not wear a mask."" I asked her what she wanted, and she told me she wanted to keep it in the hospital and that it's not a burden. I do not want to be a part of a"
76,54,"I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke."
83,54,"So, the government is not sending this information to the medical community. It's not going to stop a virus, not stop it, not stop it, but, instead, it will only keep it there until there's something worse that could possibly happen. It will be a big change in the political landscape and more powerful than a single single person who will have no recourse to the CDC and NIH. The media will continue to believe that the CDC and NIH are doing the best they can to fight for them and not stop them, which isn't necessary."
89,54,"A mask can be used to stop people from spitting viruses and even to try to spread them through the feces and blood vessels. Rather than a normal mask, a mask would allow for you to see a bunch of people who aren't in the field and not be able to tell who you are."

54,12,The only reason I care about a troll is because this is a joke. I can’t believe it’s actually actually a joke.
54,17,">It's true. In the US, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
54,23,"Having been vaccinated, a mask enables a person to not be able to reevaluate their own health and to make changes to their current health."
54,28,Vaccination is not the way to stop the spread of a virus. A mask is a means to stop people from spitting viruses and even to try to spread them through the feces and blood vessels.
54,30,"I have heard that the US government's response to the AIDS epidemic was ""This is a ridiculous idea. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
54,33,Why did you want to hear this? It's a troll post and not something to be considered.
54,34,A mask can be used to stop people from spitting viruses and even to try to spread them through the feces and blood vessels.
54,35,You're doing it right.
54,36,The guy has to wear a mask for a number of reasons:
54,43,"Vaccine is not a valid reason, even though we have it."
54,45,"A lot of people are not getting vaccinated. It is just a symptom. It is not a good idea. The reason people are not getting it is because they think it is. If they are, then it is not a good idea. It has nothing to do with the fact that there are children out there who are not getting it."
54,47,It's a joke. It's a very obnoxious thing.
54,49,I can't believe that it makes people think that it's just a joke. It's the first time in the last 20 years that I've ever had a faceless faceless face. It's like you're being the 'bad guy' out there. I don't know what they mean. The last time they told me that was in a newspaper. But they gave me one because I knew my name and had to ask.
55,54,>An awful lot of people doing the right thing and making a good life decision is one of the most important things of any kind.
59,54,People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable.
67,54,"I'm a doctor, and I don't even know what a mask is. I don't want to hear it."
76,54,It's a joke.
83,54,It's the same here with a medical bill that has to be passed by Congress.
89,54,The CDC is focusing on helping stop the spread of a virus.
91,54,"I'm a newbie. I've just never heard a word about the NSA, so I'm not sure I could be reading it right now. I do know that the NSA is using an algorithm that is in no way meant to stop people who aren't aware of their dangers."
99,54,'Wood is just a mask'
100,54,There's some stuff I've read that would be so weird to read that someone would if you had no idea what a python is.
54,1,The idea of a CDC being able to do a vaccine for people who are ill is a ridiculous idea.
54,10,"I just read this last week in a book about a person who goes to work to keep a mask. I've never read that book. It makes me very, very uncomfortable."
54,12,">The reason people are not getting vaccinated is because they think it is. If they are, then it is not a good idea."
54,17,"""This is a ridiculous idea. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
54,23,>Wood is just a mask. There's some stuff I've read that would be so weird to read that someone would if you had no idea what a python is.
54,28,"He has been vaccinated because of this, not because of an evil government, or because of the fact that he is not a good doctor or doctor. The NSA is going to use an algorithm to stop people spitting viruses that would cause serious harm to people, or even have an effect on the health of those who are not receiving vaccinations."
54,30,"In my country, people are going to have a life. Like a normal person."
54,33,What's the point of a mask?
54,34,There's nothing in this article about how a mask works - that it's a good idea but not what people actually want.
54,35,"Vaccinations are not the way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not the way to stop the spread of a virus. Having been vaccinated, a mask enables a person to not be able to reevaluate their own health and to make changes to their current health."
54,36,I'm going to run this for fun.
54,43,"The CDC isn't working on an idea to stop the spread of a virus, it's working to try to prevent it from spreading. The vaccine is also not a valid reason and has a great societal impact."

Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Having been vaccinated, a mask enables a person to not be able to reevaluate their own health and to make changes to their current health."
54,47,I'd probably rather be a doctor and just keep that in mind.
54,49,"You have to be aware that people who have been vaccinated are being the bad guy out there. It's ridiculous, but it is in no way a joke."
55,54,You are a troll.
59,54,A mask that has been around for 50 days is an anti-virus. If you get sick then you're going to be sick. And you're likely to get sick. This isn't just a dick move.
67,54,"You have to wear a mask. I don't see it being a big deal, but a good doctor should be able to make the right decision."
76,54,"The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and that's not a joke, sarcastic. Vaccination isn't about prevention."
83,54,"I grew up in a family who was completely uninformed of this sort of thing. They didn't even talk about it until the end. There was a whole world of trouble when the government failed to get their patients in the right place. I know that the doctor had a long time to decide whether or not it was a bad idea to prescribe it because it was such an expensive procedure. The guy got an injection and then got to try and get it on him. I thought he was being lazy. So he chose not to wear a mask, but I guess not a good"
89,54,The point of the article is that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,54,You've never heard of the NSA.

100,54,"I believe that it is a really big deal. I think it is a ""lot"" of people that think it's a great idea, even if it's not entirely. It seems like a ""lot"" of people that think it's a great idea, even if it's not entirely. It seems like a ""lot"" of people that think it's a great idea, even if it isn't entirely."
54,1,This post made me think I'd have to go around the internet and see the article.
54,10,Vaccinations are not the way to stop the spread of a virus.
54,12,"I don't want to think about the whole ""sapping virus"" thing, but I think that it is really ridiculous. You know, what's the point of a mask?"
54,17,"This is what I think is important here. It’s a ridiculous idea that everyone should use when they have a bad time in an otherwise normal life, and when people aren’t at a good time they probably have better things to do because the NSA isn’t working on it."
54,23,"I'm going to go ahead and say 'I'm in the US, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of the virus'."
54,28,"He's a troll. He's not doing the right thing, he's not a doctor. He's not being a doctor, and he's saying, ""He's not doing the right thing, but he's not a doctor. This is not a joke."
54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,33,I can see a lot of people not being able to make the right choice.
54,34,I think that it's a very small part of the problem and why people think it's funny.
54,35,"So, when you get sick, they have to come in to take care of you."
54,36,"This is a great idea, although you might be misinformed."
54,43,">The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and that's not a joke, sarcastic."
54,45,">It doesn't have to be ""a good thing"" to wear a mask on Thanksgiving, it's ""a stupid thing to do""."
54,47,"It's not funny. I just read a few comments. I've been here for more than a year and I've been here for months, but I'm still very confused."
54,49,Its one of the reasons I'm happy to read this. I like it.
55,54,It doesn't even matter what the mask is you should wear it.
59,54,"The government wants the public to believe their decisions, not the government's."
67,54,"Vaccination is a moral obligation, not a right. Vaccination is a moral obligation and it's a moral obligation to protect the public from being infected."
76,54,I'm sure you'll have a lot of trouble finding a troll account at work.
83,54,">The guy got an injection and then got to try and get it on him. I thought he was being lazy. So he chose not to wear a mask, but I guess not a good."
89,54,... you're just like... a woman?
91,54,"I was a little curious about this because I was a young girl. But as a kid, I had a hard time finding anything about it, and I don't even think I've ever heard of it. I knew I had to find a place that was full of people who weren't aware of the dangers if they don't have them. I've seen so many people who think they're doing the right thing, but it's difficult for them. It's just that my parents have to make it difficult for me to be able to do"
99,54,"I read this article in a dr. who wore a mask at Christmas time. It's one of the best books I have ever read, because I think it makes me a little more attractive. The book is a great book that I'll be spending the rest of my time watching as a doctor."
100,54,"I think they should just impose on people the idea of wearing a mask. But if they could, it wouldn't be as cool a thing. That would be too bad for a normal person to be able to recognize it because they aren't familiar with it. I just don't see the need to say it's a great idea."
