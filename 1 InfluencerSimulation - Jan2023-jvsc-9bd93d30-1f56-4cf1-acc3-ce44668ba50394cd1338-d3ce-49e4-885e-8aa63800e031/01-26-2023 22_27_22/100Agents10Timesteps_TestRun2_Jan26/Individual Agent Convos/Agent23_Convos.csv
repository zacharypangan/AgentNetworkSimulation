34,23,"So what are you wearing, and what is going to happen to those people with this virus? Are you not afraid to wear a mask for that much or your friends will just look out the window and see how you are feeling or if they can be uncomfortable? Is this really your own experience, as in your own life? Do you need to know why people aren't using masks to keep you safe?"

23,6,"It's kind of funny that this happens, but it happens a lot in a country like Canada. It's funny that there are people who don't wear a mask. It seems like there is an awful lot of stigma associated with the disease. But it's not like it happens everywhere."
23,19,Vaccination is about the prevention of infection and spreading a virus. It's just an example of what it would be like if it were not for a virus.
23,20,So you wear a mask at the movies?
30,23,"I don't believe the government is giving a right to wear a mask, which is a form of protest."
32,23,"You can't be a patriot without a mask and a helmet. I don't understand why people don't wear a mask at work, but they have to work in the same way in an emergency that they don't have a jacket and a shirt. The only thing is they have to wear a mask in the way they're doing it. I have to wear one for the fear of being attacked."

92,23,I have been here before but you are just saying that you think there is nothing in the newer movies that explains why you don't like these types of movies.
99,23,It sounds like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. I've seen it with the new film The Secret Santa (the sequel) that was the most intense of my days. I've seen more than two of them. This guy is so good he knows what he's doing.
23,2,The mask isn't just used for a vaccination.
23,6,"This is why we need to change our rules about what our body uses for purpose. For the safety of us, we need to be on our toes and look at our surroundings and not be able to see things when it's not being used. I like to see other people try to think they're smarter than others and have fun in the process."
23,19,I'm just saying. I'm really not one to talk about what the government has done. This is the government's way to give people the right to say they aren't wearing a mask and they don't want to say anything about it.
23,20,"I know a good santa, but we don't have to wear masks. You can't be a patriot without a mask. If you don't get vaccinated you can't be a patriot without a mask."
30,23,This is a joke. I think the government needs to make it seem like a serious threat to the public's health. It seems like the CDC and CDC have little to no clue how much money they actually do.
32,23,"Is the guy who made the film Don't worry, I'm here! pretty awesome."
34,23,"A bit of background, yes. I am the only one who would be uncomfortable in a mask because I don't wear it. I also have a bad experience running on dirt and being a mess."

82,23,I've read that this was a joke.
87,23,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. I think they think there aren't any symptom of HIV. That's why they didn't have the virus as a priority for the disease. I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear a"
91,23,"... but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
92,23,"I'm also a fucking python. The problem is that a man with a mask in his mouth might go on a run, because of a virus, and he does not seem to have that confidence in him, so he wouldn't have to go out for a run unless he wanted to wear it every day."
99,23,"The Secret Santa (the sequel) isn't very good, it's a lot worse, and it really seems like a way for the government to stop it from spreading the virus."
23,2,This movie seems so much like a bad idea. You're not in a good place.

23,19,"It's a joke, and one of the many reasons why we should not put ourselves in a mask."
23,20,... and what do you think they think?
30,23,I see what you mean. It is a morale crusade.
32,23,"In some countries, the public can only be shaved without a mask. It is important to understand how the mask is used, if the person is not interested in this, then they should wear a mask, like in a cigarette."

87,23,I'm a nurse and the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinated is very interesting. The ad is pretty great.

63,23,People are dying. I don't believe the people who were trying to spread the virus. There is a huge difference between getting sick and trying to survive the spread of it.
75,23,RIP a papilloma guy. What's this?
82,23,What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny?
87,23,"So, the joke would be: ""Well, at the end of the day, unless it's me, I'm the one who's getting the vaccinated, I can't wear my face mask, because I'm terrified, and I've got a terrible fever."""
91,23,That part is a good point.

23,20,"Vaccinations are very important and I believe there is a lot of scientific research on how to stop the spread of mumps. It is not a good idea, it's just a good idea. You get a little bit of fun out of that. You can wear a mask, but it does not prevent any disease."
30,23,A lot of people think that wearing a mask on a run is a big threat.

87,23,You're talking about this ad. It's ridiculously silly that people on this list are doing something that's not relevant. This is about a virus. It's not about an immunity problem or being sick if it's a virus.
91,23,The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the government is using the NSA's surveillance method.

63,23,"CDC should be more specific about this. It's not just the government, it's the people. And, on the other hand, you can wear a mask for no apparent reason."
75,23,Wearing a mask to prevent a pandemic is very important to prevent it.
82,23,That's not a good joke. I read it a lot and you're right.
