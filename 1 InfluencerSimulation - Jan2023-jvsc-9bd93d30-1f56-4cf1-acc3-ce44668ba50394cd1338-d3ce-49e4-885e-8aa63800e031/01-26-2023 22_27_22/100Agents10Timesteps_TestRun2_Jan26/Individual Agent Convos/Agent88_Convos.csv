88,57,I've never seen someone wearing a mask. I can only say I've seen people wearing masks that help stop spread a virus.

88,57,> The funny part here. I love wearing a mask and can wear anything I want. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,88,"I've never met anyone who thinks the same thing about wearing a mask. In the past, I'd always thought they'd be nice to me. But I had a cynical attitude towards them. I didn't know what they were doing until afterward, and I'd just keep going and don't really do anything."
98,88,"This is just like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning. I don't even look at her face, but she's always saying something that sounds pretty cool to me."
88,10,>This is just like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning.
88,17,"Aside from being a cynical, I can say that the most hilarious and most interesting part of this whole thing is that it was an entire thread about a man who was so in love with a fat lip and wanted to be in a mask. Now we can just talk about how awesome he was and that he actually likes wearing a mask."

88,57,"""This is just like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning. I don't even look at her face, but she's always saying something that sounds pretty cool to me."
97,88,You're gonna have to give your mask to a man you don't want to be with. And I'd wear a mask if he had a phobia about it.
98,88,"So, you like wearing a mask because you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows you like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows"
88,10,I feel like if I had a fat lip in I'd probably be the only one who could wear a mask in public.
88,17,I'm glad it didn't end in him falling for a new virus that he doesn't believe it's spreading.
88,51,Then what's the point of not allowing it in your twenties. The twenties are the worst. But I never saw anyone wearing a mask. I'm in my 50's and I think this is the best one on the planet.
88,57,"I don't like wearing my mask in public because it isn't in front of people I don't want to see. I don't want to do it in my office, but I want to do it. I don't have the time for anything outside of that."
97,88,"Wearing a mask can actually help stop a virus. So it's the only way for someone to go through this, and is also very useful."
98,88,I think that is a great answer :) I am a doctor and have not smoked a cigarette since I was 12 years old And when you wear a mask you don't actually have to worry about losing it in the future.
88,10,> Then what's the point of not allowing it in your twenties.
88,17,I've been in my 50s and I don't like wearing a mask.
88,51,I don't believe that a virus that is infected a person in their 50's can spread outside their home. So I don't think we're going to see one if that doesn't kill you yet.
88,57,"If you're going to go out and do it, a mask helps stop a virus that is spreading, the truth is that a fat lip does not protect you from the spread of a virus."
97,88,"The idea that wearing a mask is needed is that we have no way to stop the spread of the virus. We don't know if there is something infected, we know when it is infected and if it's infected."
98,88,I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because
88,10,I'm really just gonna throw in some information on the other side of the argument...
88,17,It's been said a lot of times that the problem is that people are unaware that there is a virus in their area and have never been vaccinated.
88,51,It's been a few months. But I did a few times in my lifetime.
88,57,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus. We don't know if it's spread outside of their home.
97,88,I don't think this is a good place to start with.
98,88,I think it's a great answer because i'm gonna have to ask myself if I can help you with anything besides my face.
88,10,...And I can't afford the surgery.
88,17,The truth is that a mask does not protect you from the spread of a virus. We don't know if it's spread outside of their home.
88,51,I'm a man who has a phobia about putting on a mask in public and I can't help it if someone is around me. I'm so sorry.
88,57,"That's the only way to stop a virus and also protects people, the other side is not."
97,88,Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus.
98,88,What's the point of wearing a mask? Because i don't have any cigarette. The point of wearing a mask is to protect me. I don't really care how much you wear a mask. I think it's a great answer.
88,10,"I wear a mask for protection when I do this, and it makes me more comfortable. It's the way to help you."
88,17,"I think the point is that if you have a phobia about putting on a mask in public and if you can't help it if someone is around you. I'm so sorry. That's the only way to stop a virus and also protects people, the other side is not. Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus. The idea that wearing a mask is needed is that we have no way to stop the spread of a virus. We don't know if it's fucking infect a "
88,51,Why would it be a good idea to wear a mask to protect yourself when you're not in school? There's no reason to wear it unless you're in the medical field.
88,57,"The underlying message of what the question is is... ''We should stop allowing these things in our lives. They're not going to stop the spread of any virus ''? The question is why you're supposed to wear a mask, as that's what they're supposed to do."
97,88,"I think the ""I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
98,88,"You are a fucking nut. You've made a great point, it's just that you need to get your hair cut."
88,10,"I don't see how you can rely on that. This is about keeping the health of your body intact, especially the vaccinated."
88,17,CANNOTANSWER THOSE THINGS.
88,51,"I'm sorry but this story has a lot of holes. This is what I'm saying here, which is a bit strange."
88,57,"So I grew up in a town with no AIDS, so it's been quite a while since I had a vaccination. Now I'm going to need to look into the disease to see if that means that I am at risk for getting it, so I am going to go in with some people and ask them what I think of that virus. But i can't if I don't want to. So I went in and did what I could to try and make sure I wasn't 'cleaned up' on the virus, and it'"
97,88,I've been told it's a joke and it's not true.
98,88, I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a
88,10,I feel like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning.
88,17,I'm not a doctor. You need to get the flu checked out.
88,51,i think i think this is one of the most important parts of the story
88,57,"In addition to the other points, this is also related to the fact that it's called ""AIDS"", and the vaccine doesn't even cover all of those words and phrases. The people in this thread have a lot to say about the situation."
97,88,I hate all these sexist jokes...
98,88,The fact that the government has used a disguise to scare people is ridiculous.
