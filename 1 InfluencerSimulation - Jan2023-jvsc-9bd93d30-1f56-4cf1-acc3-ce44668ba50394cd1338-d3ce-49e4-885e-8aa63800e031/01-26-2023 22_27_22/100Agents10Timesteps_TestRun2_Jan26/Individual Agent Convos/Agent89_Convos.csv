99,89,There's also a big difference between a mask and an ass suit - if a friend is wearing a mask the person they are wearing will not wear the mask to.

90,89,"I was thinking this was the link to the first two paragraphs, but I'm actually still trying to figure out if there is a link to the second paragraph. Rather than read it. I just found out that the other part is that he said that he thought wearing a mask and keep distance was something like what you had written before you. But the second is a bit of a blur to illustrate how the idea of a mask might be more valid. It's one of the major ways the government is working to stop spread the disease in the state"
99,89,And there's also a big difference between a mask and an ass suit - if a friend is wearing a mask the person they are wearing will not wear the mask to.

89,36,"I just think it's kinda funny that a large percentage of the commenters in here are trying to explain why they are using a different type of mask to get a shave. There may be a lot more than this, but if the author wanted to explain that it wasn't the same thing as the original post, he would probably just have had no problem at all with the comment."

89,12,"It makes me feel like I'm running for the CDC, because I'm so busy. I'm just not feeling like I'm getting enough sleep to care for someone else's health, and I'm really trying to make my health even more important to everyone's health.
