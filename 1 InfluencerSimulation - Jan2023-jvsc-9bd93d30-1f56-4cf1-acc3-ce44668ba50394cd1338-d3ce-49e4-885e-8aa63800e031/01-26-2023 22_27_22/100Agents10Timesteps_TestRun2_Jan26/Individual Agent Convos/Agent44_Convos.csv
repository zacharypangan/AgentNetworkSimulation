69,44,Hi how are you today? Do you like my mask and want me to run for you?
79,44,Why would someone that lives in a conservative county want to wear a mask and go around being pushed back by an elected official?
81,44,This is what the government is doing i think.
93,44,They are so big on this one that they could do anything to try and get the word out there for them.
97,44,"I'm a man – not in a wheelchair, just wearing a mask, but I did a quick google search... and I just went there"

44,1,"I think that's a good one, as I hate that the government is trying to take away the ability to tell people to wear masks, and they're actually trying to make them wear a mask. I think a lot of the things they do aren't as good as they used to be, or at least aren't very good enough."
44,2,I believe they are trying to make people wear masks for some reason. It is not their job to prevent a virus. They are trying to make people wear masks for the same reason.
44,7,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world"

44,11,"They are saying people need to wear masks, or they should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus."
44,12,It's a good idea to wear them when you're walking out.
44,13,"""How would a person wearing a mask, or should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus?"""
44,18,Do you really think that the government would be able to pass the laws on preventing a virus?
44,26,I just found the link on r/politics and now I'm going to leave my mask on. My only comment is about how the government is trying to evict people in a way that seems to be very helpful to me.
44,30,I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see how that will stop a virus from spreading.
44,32,"I read the second comment, and I couldn't figure out the answer. I read the second sentence because it makes me want to laugh."
44,39,"I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world The fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that."

69,44,I am a full vaxxed W proof.
79,44,"People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
81,44,I think it's hilarious that people in the US have a mask at their jobs.
93,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community.
97,44,"That's quite a bit of talking nonsense, oh, no, this is just a random line from a movie."
100,44,I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more difficult to understand when the person is wearing a mask because they think they know a better way to do it. Wearing a mask and a mask is so much more difficult than just wearing a mask. It's actually more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.
44,1,"It's funny that so many people in the U.S. don't wear a mask at their job, but there's a very glaring difference between them and the other one."
44,2,"I am very very, very concerned with this and I am so sorry, my apologies, for being so rude and naive and so unresponsive to you. I am trying to stop the spread of this disease."

44,8,I thought the guy who has an MS was going to start a business in the US as a computer engineer to keep a big profit. So it’s good to be on a roll.

44,11,"In Canada I wear a mask that I keep on to wear when I go out and not to wear a mask. I like to wear them because I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person."
44,12,"As someone who just figured out how to tell people not to wear masks, you can be absolutely right."
44,13,"I just want to add that if people wearing masks are attempting to prevent the spread of a virus, they are failing to do the right thing. The problem is that there is not enough information available that people can use."
44,18,Are there any other ways to prevent a virus?
44,26,"So, a friend of mine has a mask at his job because she was a zombie, because of the fact that she was trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
44,30,There's a great article on the internet about people using masks to stop a virus from spreading. It's written by [as in: [how to](http://www.gov.uk/hgb/fd/politics/dhhgg/snasp_sp/nodal_war_comments/gspssn/polite/political_war_management.pdf).

44,39,You need to get an eviction.
44,42,"In the US, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right."
69,44,I have a friend who is very sick of this. She's really sick of it.

100,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,1,"A very good piece of research is also going on about the effects of infection from different infections in different places, ranging from influenza to acrobatics. It explains why people are being unable to see the disease, and it also explains why people do not like the idea of a 'viral' outbreak. It's a complex problem and it might not help you get the virus to spread."
44,2,That's why I say you don't want to be on a roll.

44,8,"I'm a bit of a dick, but I think he's right."
44,10,"I don't think you're right. ""Suicide is a great way to prevent it"" is one of the most common ways to prevent it."
44,11,"Yes. But don't wear a mask at work. You have to be very caring, caring, and compassionate to not wear a mask. Especially if you've gotta wear it when you're out with friends."
44,12,I think you need to find out what the real definition of “immoral” is.

44,26,I just noticed that you have two ideas : I'm a good person.
44,30,"I don't see why the government doesn't have a right to make people wear a mask, it's just how it's made people, and it's what drives a lot of the bigotry. It's what keeps people from being so petty and naive that they're just doing it because they're smart and they can't afford to pay for it."
44,32,"> ""How would a person wearing a mask, or should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus?"""
44,39,It's very hard to tell who is the worst person to not wear a mask at work. The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
44,42,You're right to be concerned. I have a friend who is really sick of this. She's really sick of this.
69,44,"I've just got a little bit of a virus in my face - not sure if a friend of mine really cares or if she's a sick or uninformed person but I don't see that being a joke is going to make you uncomfortable. You are doing it with a friend who is sick of it, I don't want your mask to be dirty and the fact that you can't keep a hygienic face mask on the table that doesn't fit on a computer. You can't wear a mask or "
79,44,I can't find my wife for you.
81,44,I see that you need to find a new way to communicate with your colleagues that is more important and meaningful to you than just a mask. It's not a necessary thing for the company to make you think you're a good person.
93,44,I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I don't want to go in the first place.

44,2,"I am a woman, I am so sorry that you need to get an eviction."
44,7,"i like the quote ""I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person.

44,10,> The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
44,11,"I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe. Its really sad that so many people aren't wearing a mask at work, if not even at work, and when you are out and about, you're being so selfish. I think there's a difference between the two, but you are a bit over sensitive and I can't imagine what that can be."
44,12,I don't think this is a legitimate argument for the government to protect the sick from a virus.

69,44,"I don't know if that is a joke, but I do know it's not the NSA, which is based on a slapstick meme."
79,44,"The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."
81,44,It's not a necessary thing for the company to make you think you're a good person. It's a joke.

100,44,"There isn't a big difference between wearing a mask and a virus. The two problems aren't the same, but both problems are not the same."

44,13,I'm sure it would be funny to hear you have a mask because a woman whose body is covered in a red blood cell is causing it's own death.
44,18,"If a slapstick meme is made up, it's a fad, and you could argue that the government should not be able to protect the sick from a virus. If it was made up, it would be a legitimate fad and I'm not gonna get out of there without one."
44,26,"Yes, the government has a right to make people wear a mask."
44,30,Despite the fact that they don't want people to wear a mask they need a reason to do it. I can see no point.

81,44,"I've read a lot of good, and very funny, things about the virus (i.e. the tv show The smoopy little troll) but the fact that the CDC is an evil company makes it seem like it's the one doing it."
93,44,I think most people are just being honest. There's a huge difference between wearing a mask and a mask and a virus in general.
97,44,"Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias. In my experience, the only thing a phobia has in common with women is that they don't know the purpose of the word'sick' or'sick' because they don't know if they can tell a lie. It's just one. A mask prevents the spread of a virus. A mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."

44,1,People should wear a mask at work.
44,2,"If you're tired of saying things like ""I wear a mask when I don't have a job"" you have a phobia."
44,7,"I'm not sure what '''I'm feeling'' is in the first place, but maybe it would be possible for people in this sub to understand the context of their own responses."
44,8,Is there an infection with a slang term that's used to describe this?
44,10,"This sounds like a lot of work to you. I am not going to lie here, I'm not going to write an entire novel about the government. It's a really long piece of work to do, I think."
44,11,"I think it's a good idea to wear a mask at work, and not wear a mask on a holiday, and to be able to see if you are safe. This is not an ""asshole"" joke."
44,12,I'm in Texas and I have a very serious phobia of people.
44,13,I grew up in an AZ area and they are really crappy on the CIA and the government
44,18,"A slapstick meme isn't a slapstick meme, it's just a joke about how the CIA hasn't started a virulence."

44,30,">The government isn't trying to stop the spread of viruses, they are trying to make people wear a mask"", ""I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that.

81,44,"In some places, wearing a mask at work is a joke, but in some areas it can also be quite effective. If you're an insurance agent, that's another reason to be cautious. This is not an insurance company and you don't have to use a hat on your employees. It's a hat, too."
93,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,"""This is quite a bit of talking nonsense, oh, no, this is just a random line from a movie."
