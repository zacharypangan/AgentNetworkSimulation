23,19,I'm just saying. I'm really not one to talk about what the government has done. This is the government's way to give people the right to say they aren't wearing a mask and they don't want to say anything about it.

23,19,It was really a good joke. The Secret Santa is a great movie.
67,19,This is one of those things where your hands don't even get tucked in the bag of food.
73,19,"We have an extremely important issue to focus on. There's no way to say that a man who says he is good at being nice and wearing a mask in public doesn't do it.

97,19,I think that is a really good point. I think it also means that you have to wear a mask. That's not just wearing a mask but actually going from one person to another.

19,3,I was on a computer at a party today and my friend made me laugh. I did not know it was so awkward to have to wear a mask.

19,3,We're going to have a major government war because of the virus. This is so weird.
19,6,It's funny. But not that joke. It's just that people do not care about the fact that their hands are tucked in the bag of food.
23,19,Vaccinations are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny?
67,19,"We have the vaccine, so I have no problem with it. I think we should have the vaccine, too. I think it's funny that there are still people who would be offended by this, because I don't like it."
73,19,"So, I think the government is inefficient, but we're not going to stop the spread of AIDS if he doesn't work on that. I'm not a fan of the government, but I think the problem isn't that it's not helping, but that it's just not the same as the disease."

75,19,I'm gonna try to figure out what my husband has done.
89,19,"This was a post I read last night. I saw that it was a prank. Apparently, there is a wiki page about this.
