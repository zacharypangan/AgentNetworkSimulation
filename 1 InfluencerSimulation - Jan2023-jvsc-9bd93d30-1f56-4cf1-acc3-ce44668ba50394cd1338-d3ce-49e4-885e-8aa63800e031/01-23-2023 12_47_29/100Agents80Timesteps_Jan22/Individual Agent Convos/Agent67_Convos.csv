71,67,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
92,67,covid is really bad right now mask up and be careful
95,67,this is shaping up to be an unnecessarily stressful week but if the texassupremecourt holds up anti mask mandate we ll have to withdraw the kids again and homeschool again too many other school districts have already seen cases spike for us to take chances
97,67,when is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it but when is the social emotional end when sports resumed when i got vaccinated when mask mandates were lifted when x of americans are vaccinated
98,67,due to an obvious difference in size as in body size anti masker reluctantly adjusted his mask responsible citizen is over feet tall big the type of person you don t want to fight unless you absolutely have to
67,7,Are you sure this will stop any outbreaks like this?
67,10,"I was in Miami when I got vaccinated. When I got back, I didn't want to bother vaccinate my kids. Now I have an empty mask, i've got a new one."

67,48,"In the US it would be easier to get vaccinated than to get vaccinated without a mask. This is a great sign, and you can make the announcing decisions for your children."

67,64,I think the public health orders are quite valid.
70,67,"A sling or a mask, like you say, can still protect against flu. That is, if you do get it right, then that should be it."
71,67,"I don't think there's enough proof to support why kids are being forced to wear masks in the first place. There's more than enough evidence to support the concept that kids are unable to recover from covid, the lack of evidence against them, or the lack of support for the lack of support for it."
92,67,"Hey, what do you think of this virus? I think you'll like a mask."
95,67,"it will be an unnecessarily stressful week for schools, because they are already seeing cases spikes in their schools."

67,50,I believe he's on the advisory board for the CDC.

67,53,"I think that a sling or a mask, can still protect against flu. That is, if you do get it right, then that should be it."

70,67,Can you tell me what the sling is?
71,67,"I don't know about the last time I got vaccinated, but I think the only reason we're getting vaccinated is because of the contaminated mask."
92,67,"Hey, what do you think of this virus? I think you'll like a mask. Are you sure you aren't joking? You aren't. Is that what you said?"
95,67,Why do you think the anti mask mandate will get voted up in this sub? Why is there a tv show?
97,67,When does the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it but when is the social emotional end when sports resumed when i got vaccinated when mask mandates were lifted when x of americans are vaccinated Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccination list.

67,37,"""Too young to have a passport. That's the way of my life"""
67,38,I think that the CDC and the mayor have decided that the mandate is ineffective and unnecessary and people should be vaccinated.
67,39,"I have a passport and a cigarette, so the CDC is recommending a ban on the Vaccines should be banned."
67,43,"It sounds like the public health order is quite valid. It could protect against the flu, but I'm not sure that it is quite accurate."
67,47,The CDC is a lot more concerned about vaccinations than health care - the government's position on preventing it in the first place - with their actions. They're trying to prevent them from being fully vaccinated and they're ignoring them - and they're not going to stop them from doing anything for the people who are vaccinated.

67,7,"Yes, I know they want to get rid of that mandate, but don't want a government that can make it a law to be completely absent. They aren't going to stop it from happening unless they are completely uninformed about it. "

67,38,"I can understand that CDC is recommending that if an outbreak does develop, they will make a move to banning the vaccinating laws. If you have the CDC's permission, then your dicks must be in the CDC's name."
67,39,"""I don't think there's enough evidence to support why kids are being forced to wear masks in the first place."""
67,43,"I'm in Indiana and this was a CDC sponsored a presentation in Indiana about the need to make the mandate repealed.

67,47,What are some good reasons you are vaccinating your face in public? I think there are a lot of good reasons to be vaccinated that don't come up in public.

92,67,I'm just saying that you don't know what a covid vaccine is.
95,67,"I know there is a controversy about it but when the CDC isn't vaccinating a person with a mask mandate there isn't a lot of evidence for that. They just don't know what to say. IMO, it's one of those things. If we were going to have the anti-masked mandate in place, I think we would have to acquiesce with the fact that it's a big enough problem to make people think of that issue as a way of putting a new one and that's what they"

71,67,"CANNOTANSWER /DARE Vaccination is one way of getting some of the worst possible symptoms.

92,67,So you're wearing a mask because you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows if you like wearing a mask. Is that what you said?
95,67,Why is the anti-masked mandate being voted up?'
97,67,"You are saying the pandemic is probably going to be over, the CDC isn't. The pandemic isn't over. It's over. I don't think I got the vaccine yet."

67,37,If it's a law in your state it's probably a bad idea for people to vaccinate someone who doesn't have a mask.
67,38,Why is the new Vaccine mandate being voted up?
67,39,The mayor is making a joke about the CDC.
67,43,A mayor who wants a ban on the ACA would like to have the health order signed by the CDC.
67,47,"CANNOTANSWER said that while he could not agree that the mask mandate is unnecessary, he does not think it should be implemented."
67,48,CANNOTANSWER thinks the CDC is making it up with its recommendations and the mayor is trying to avoid it.

70,67,"CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU I have no idea what a covid is. And he says, ""I don't think I'm a good actor. I think he's a great actor. I see you."""
71,67,"I can see why people are getting sick from the vaccine, but you're not getting sick, you're not getting sick from the contaminated mask, and you're getting sick from a contaminated mask?"
92,67,I'm sorry to say that I did. I'm sorry to say that I did.
95,67,What do you think of this new'masked mandate' that is threatening people's health?
97,67,When is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccine list. Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccine list. Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccine list.

67,32,CANNOTANSWER has been told that the federal government doesn't have the money to ban ACA vaccines in the future.
67,37,The Mayor is an Indiana citizen and his vaccinating is the way of his life. I know some kids quickly recover from this wear their masks as chin slings and he says he wants to keep a mask and not want to get caught. He is a joke about the CDC and is against the vaccinating mandate.
67,38,"The CDC wants to ban the ACA, which means the mandate will be vetoed by the mayor. The mayor, therefore, wants to veto that mandate."
67,39,When is the pandemic over?
67,43,Is there a meeting where the mayor believes the new vaccine mandate should be repealed?

67,51,There's nothing wrong with a public health order. The Mayor is not willing to wear a mask to prevent a fight.
67,53,Why the CDC says the new Vaccine mandate should be repealed?
67,57,"When he says ""I know the problem is that the CDC hasn't vaccinated people with a mask mandate, and that's why they are vaccinating someone with a mask mandate."""
67,64,And what does Indiana's mayor say?
70,67,Is there a restraining order issued for not wearing a mask?
71,67,"The current pandemic of the disease, and the CDC's failure to give the pandemic vaccine, are both a very real issue and can be addressed through medical professionals."
92,67,"Is a 'confrontation' with an uncalled for ""cannon-an-evil,"" as a joke?"
95,67,How many people are in this thread?
97,67,Is it possible that the CDC may not want to ban some of the vaccines or they may not be able to make vaccines for the ddoxmm vaccine?
98,67,"So, you've said that the issue is about whether he's uncomfortable and not wearing a mask to keep a virus circulating in his body, while the fact that people are uncomfortable and wearing masks doesn't mean he has to wear a mask in order to stop a virulent virus from spreading, he's not uncomfortable, he's not uncomfortable and the fact that he doesn't want to wear masks is a good reason to not wear one. He's also very apathetic, he's not even aware that he'"
67,7,I just found out that the mayor is an advocate for a ban on ACA vaccines.
67,10,I think that's a good reason to stay away from it.
67,12,"As an Indiana resident, this issue may have a huge impact on public health."
67,16,I like to think he would be able to get away with the ACA with not wanting to be vaccinated and avoid getting caught.
67,27,How many people are in this thread? Is there a restraining order issued for not wearing a mask?
