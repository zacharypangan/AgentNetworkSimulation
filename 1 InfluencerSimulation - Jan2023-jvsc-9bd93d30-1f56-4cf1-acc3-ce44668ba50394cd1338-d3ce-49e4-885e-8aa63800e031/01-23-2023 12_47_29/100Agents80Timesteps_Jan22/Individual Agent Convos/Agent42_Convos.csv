Well there are many medical workers that don't wear a mask while working, but do wear one when they're stressed - that's what the company is doing. And a doctor who was trained to wear one during surgery and was given no reason to wear one during an accident may also be booted, which may lead to the restraining order."

42,29,"I've been in the army for years now and I've never had a problem with that. My mother was vaccinated with HIV. During my first week of training, the doctor was told that he would not wear a mask for his wounds. A few months ago, he was told that he was on his way to hospital so he couldn't help. He did not know the disease was a problem and he was asked to wear a mask. He said: ""I don't see the point of this and to stop it"" that he had"
