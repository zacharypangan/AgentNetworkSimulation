40,3,Yes he is correct in his comment.
40,11,I've had an infection and a friend who was infected was infected and died. He didn't know it was him. He had an infection and died a week or two later. You're not going to make that argument and it's not an acceptable defense. It's not a valid excuse.

40,27,I would say that's not true. Whether or not she wore a mask is an entirely subjective matter. The reason is a doctor reprimands her for making the decision in the first place. The medical community hasn't made any decisions that will affect them. They just don't have the money to do the research or make the decision that the doctor does not want to.
