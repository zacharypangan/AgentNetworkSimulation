98,19,I want to see some of this article in a nutshell:
98,20,There's something so terrible about wearing a mask.
98,23,[Tirt of a joke](http://www.ny.gov/mil/sundays/pt/r/mild-mashing-resources/videos/Mirandal-Mask-References-Section)

I don't know how you know what it is, but it's one of those things that makes you think you are cool and you just don't like it.

98,79,"I think that one of the most important parts of the article is that it explains the ""difference"" between the masking and the other. I think it explains why people are hesitant to go with masks that don't have a visible mask and that you need to use one."
98,83,"A lot of these questions come up in a variety of forms, including a few oblivious ones (those that are more commonly described, but that don't come up in this sort of context)."

98,90,I've also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask. It's basically just a mask that lets you see what you're getting into. It's a good way to prevent any bodily activity from happening.
98,94,"In the case of facial cancer, my therapist says: ""I've been wearing a mask for years that I don't like because they hide a body part."

I was afraid that my dick would start bleeding out of it, I knew I had facial cancer and I tried to go to the gym. She told me that if I did, I'd be more likely to get a facial cancer diagnosis, and the doctor told me not to wear it, and that I would still be a face mask for the rest of the week and never get a facial"
98,11,"The article says there's a good deal about wearing a mask and people can get caught. The problem isn't that there's nothing to fight about, it's that people don't want to fight a man who's over 1000 years old. And that there's not much to fight."

98,24,I don't know. I would say it is. But it is a terrible idea. It makes you think you are cool.

98,56,The point of the article is to point out that the entire premise of the article is misleading.
98,67,"The most enlightening supposition in history to me is, ""Well I thought you said something about not wearing a mask"" and that was just a joke."
98,79,I can't see the difference in the size between wearing a mask and a mask being a dick.
98,83,"I'm a big man, and I a little taller than that. So, I don't know what I'm asking here."
98,86,I have a hulk mask on that I've been wearing for a few years now - my favorite part is that if you go over this size and don't use it then you are getting a bit of discomfort and this is how the virus becomes infectable (as opposed to just a bit of pain) - then he will have to wear a mask.
98,90,"I love masks, especially if you're a teenager, and the hulk mask is a little more feminine."
98,94,"I think the whole ""The Mask is like a dick, but with a nose"" thing is a bit stupid to read, and it's more important than that ""Face is a dick, that has no nose."" aspect makes no sense. This isn't going to help. Unless you really need to have a mask, you could be seriously fucked."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,10,I can't think of an argument that is as relevant as the other.

98,24,I've read this a few times. It's interesting because you can see where you're going a little more than the average tall person.
98,28,"I would probably not wear one if I was a teenage boy, but I'd be a big man."
98,29,"A lot of people wear masks because they are more comfortable, while others wear masks because they are comfortable, and they aren't bad for your health."

98,51,"I'm over a foot tall and wear a mask. I wear my mask to prevent that. I'm very apathetic. But to be honest, I don't see why."
98,52,You may be able to pick one of three options based on what you want to wear.

98,10,As an Australian. I don't understand how someone can be too young to be wearing masks or be over-size in terms of appearance and appearance. It's very easy for an A-level bodybuilder to wear a mask if a slender person is over-sized.
98,11,I don't think any of these ideas are snide. If you are a person with a mask you're a little taller than the average guy. The more a person wears the more they notice the more they have to wear it.
98,13,He doesn't know what he's saying.
