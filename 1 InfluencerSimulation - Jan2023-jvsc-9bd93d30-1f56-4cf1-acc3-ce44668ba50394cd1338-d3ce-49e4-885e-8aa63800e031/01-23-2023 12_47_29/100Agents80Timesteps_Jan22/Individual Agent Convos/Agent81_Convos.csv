81,15,The doctor wrote a stupid post for a medical student to get in a mask for a long time. If you didn't get vaccinated then you could have stayed for a while and then it would be a pretty good idea to just tell them to go get some more or get a new one.
81,22,No. It's a joke. The doctors aren't working with a doctor.

81,22,[NAME] & [NAME] wear masks all the time to protect themselves but it's not as if they are the simplest way to get help. Vaccination is like a disease.

81,32,"Yes, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
81,39,Because the joke is about the prank and the doctor is about what the joke is about.
81,46,"The point of a prank is to get people to think that they're in a better place than the people who are trying to prevent them from getting sick. It's not a joke.

81,50,"So, what is the question?"
81,51,It's an obvious joke. I don't know how that is possible but it sounds like the doctor is probably a little clueless about the joke and is going to sway people around.
81,53,CANNOTANSWER.
81,56,There is no such thing as a joke.
81,57,"I think it's because there's a difference between a mask and a hat, and the joke is about the doc."

81,10,"CANNOTANSWER,"
81,13,"In a nutshell, I'm an anti-masked man who hates all kinds of jokes and it's just like a doctor who has a problem with a doctor and it is not a joke based on it."
81,15,If you wear a mask you're sick and a medical student is sick. That makes you sick. That is the same point you want to make. You should not wear a mask.
81,22,"A doctor is a doctor, and the joke about him wearing a mask is a joke about how he would act if he wore a mask over himself."
81,26,"It's a joke. I think the joke is funny because the premise is that a doctor needs to be vaccinated before a doctor is required to do it. If people acclimate themselves to vaccination if they don't, they get it back, and if they don't get it back they get it back."
81,28,'Measuring a mask and bending over please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please Please..''

81,46,"I apologise for not having a clear understanding of the wording of the cdc's headline, but I can certainly say it's pretty hysterical that people are able to tell the joke is a joke and not just the fact that it's an obvious joke. It's a joke because people are trying to get people to think they're in a better place than the people who are trying to prevent people from getting sick,"
81,47,"You are not an apologist but this is a joke. I see people making jokes about being vaccinated, I see them being vaccinated and making a joke about it because I think it is a joke."
81,49,I think this is a very common one.
