62,19,I'm so sorry. I have a very good memory and I'm not too scared. What can I do to prevent it from happening to me?
62,21,Especially if your in the army. I'm sure there's more to it than you think!
62,24,You are right. The reason people are asking this is to help prevent the spread of the virus. This is not an issue to address. This is the problem that should be addressed.
62,27,... Do i want to risk spreading the virus to people who cannot afford to get the virus not at all wear a mask?
62,33,"You're right, it's the first time I've heard a comment like this from a CDC medical professional. It's very much a personal preference to choose between getting the virus and not getting vaccinated."

62,52,"If you wear a mask, your body will know you are infected. The fecal vaccine is one of those things that can cause some serious pain if the body is infected. This is a sign of a serious condition. The fecal vaccine has to come from a human."

78,62,"Yeah. I feel like I've been getting the premise wrong. You've only spoken the words out loud, I can't figure out why you didn't know the answers - you were so close to being the correct one, or how you had a misunderstanding about religion and what to make of it."
79,62,"This is a good point. I feel like that isn't how it works. There are plenty of situations in which you cann't afford to have a mask on.
