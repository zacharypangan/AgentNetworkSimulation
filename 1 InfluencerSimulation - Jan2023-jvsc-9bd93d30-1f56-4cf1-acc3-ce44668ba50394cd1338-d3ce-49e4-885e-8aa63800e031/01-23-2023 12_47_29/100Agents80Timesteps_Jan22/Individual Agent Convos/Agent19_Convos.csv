19,10,hi everyone plz just wear a mask i don t wanna be unemployed again
19,14,Are you okay with wearing a mask?
30,19,"A few weeks before the vaccine will be available, we need to change the mandate for the vaccine. The masks will be mandated soon, so the government can take the required shit."
32,19,The current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible. What they've said is what it says:
36,19,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,19,This is the very real news. I do not even care what your story is about.
54,19,What are you doing? What do you think?
58,19,Why don't health workers be prepared for a cold or flu?
62,19,I'm so sorry. I have a very good memory and I'm not too scared. What can I do to prevent it from happening to me?
64,19,"i can't afford to get sick, what did you do?"

98,19,Why do people wear masks? They can stop the virus.
19,4,This isn't a normal comment.
19,10,"Well first of all, do you think this is a good story? That's not my story."
19,14,"A few weeks before the vaccine will be available, we need to change the mandate for the vaccine. The masks will be mandated soon, so the government can take the required shit."
30,19,What's an amazing idea is that these people in a position of power are inexplicably able to take advantage of public health while in office while protecting themselves from health-related hazards.
32,19,Is there a specific government organization that could help you with preventing public health problems?
36,19,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

98,19,How would that be acceptable to the virus?
19,4,It's a shame that the people who are trying to prevent a pandemic from spreading will never get the vaccination and it's just not a natural thing to do.

32,19,CANNOTANSWER says that the current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible. He said it's pretty odd how people are getting sick without a mask.
36,19,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,19,He's not a doctor. It's a real threat to your health.

62,19,"I'm so sorry you are feeling this way about this. There are plenty of situations in which you can't afford a mask. It's definitely not going to happen, but there is no reason why you should wear a mask."
64,19,"CANNOTANSWER is telling his boss that wearing a mask on your face isn't an option, so he should wear it while working. It's more efficient than a mask in front of the manager if he can get sick."
78,19,And they drew them from Georgia as a prequel in the Bible.
89,19,"OP is a real life scumbag and I don't think he is crazy or naive. The way you express yourself in public is to say, ""I don't really care about the pandemic. I see the scars on your face and I don't really care about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask.

89,19,"If you wear a mask in public to work, you don't have to wear it. And you can be the one in the hospital."
91,19,What is the difference between the two statements?

19,14,"I think you're getting a little confusing with the whole ""I'm gonna have to wear my mask to the hospital"" thing"
30,19,I like to think that this kind of person will never become a politician. There is a reason for this:

36,19,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,19,"Cannotanyer, as well as his family members have been diagnosed with HIV/Aids and a ton of other diseases, have not been vaccinated. I don't know what your motivation is or the reasons, but they sound very similar to yours."
54,19,"> The best thing you can do is to not see the face, it isn't your right to make it seem like the man doesn't know you."

64,19,"My father told me that he was a dick. So he decided to get a doctor vaccinated so he could come in and clean up his illness. So I drank it, it hurt my throat and I couldn't even get out of the hospital. So he resorted to a mask on his face instead of putting on a mask? He's obviously just being sloppy."
78,19,"The word ""Masked Man"" is probably not the same as the word ""Move-Masked"", since ""It's so much like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few "", 'oh man you should come to Georgia ', 'oh man you should come to Georgia ', 'Ouch!'"""
