98,83,due to an obvious difference in size as in body size anti masker reluctantly adjusted his mask responsible citizen is over feet tall big the type of person you don t want to fight unless you absolutely have to
83,16,If I were you I would have not been brave enough to wear a mask at all because my dad used to be one of the only guys to wear one in my family.
83,22,"In the morning when I was suddenly overcome with the urge, I was suddenly overcome with the urge, the yeet the whole paper into the street when i grabbed it from my stoop"
83,41,i m so sorry to see you lose this. i m really tired of the trolls who do this.
83,46,i think this seems like the worst thing i've seen all day. i'm sure you'll find a way to get the sleeve in. you know how we can't force someone else to do something they're not a member of...
83,47,"I was about to post a picture of a cat in a mask, and when I did it, a cat in a mask I bought just got to know me a little better. So when I posted the picture of the cat, I was a little overwhelmed by the urge, but I can understand why you might feel so bad now because you feel such a shame to someone. I really can’t say that I do know that I could wear a mask, but I also have the sense of sadness that I cannot handle my own mind to do things in the image of that person being wearing"

83,51,I have the urge to go over my head to my phone with this shit :)
83,52,i am a big satan and it is my favorite thing to do
83,57,"You want to say something? And what is it that you want to say, and not what you want to say?"
83,65,I just remember it. I couldn't help it. It was such a great idea.
94,83,Huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
98,83,That's very interesting. If it's not an obvious difference in size you don't want to fight because it's not very effective. It's also not that obvious. You should probably get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on Amazon.
83,16,"I'm a big satan, and this is the only time I've ever seen someone wearing a mask. This is why I adore the mask."
83,22,"I don't think there is an easy way to get a good mask unless you can find a way. It sounds like you are going to make it more difficult to use. The problem with masks is that if you don't have the courage to do it, you should probably not buy them. You should not be willing to put down a mask because that's not what your face looks like."
83,41,I've been here for 15 years. I'm just trying to get this jinxed out of my head and let you know how I've responded.
83,46,"So your dad says that, ""I don't understand how this works in the first place."""
83,47,I am glad you aren't being silly.
83,48,I like wearing masks. It's very convenient and effective. :-) I am not a huge fan of these type of things.
83,51,The article that you used to say about a person who wanted to wear a mask is the worst part.
83,52,"So, what's the title of the picture?"
83,57,Why not have a big satan?
83,65,It's not an obvious difference in size but an obvious need for a little more self awareness.
94,83,"The Humble Covid is a big part of that ""what if?"" comment."
98,83,Why does the person over feet tall big have to wear masks? Is this a good idea or a bad idea?
83,16,"So if you want to have a little self awareness, buy a mask?"
83,22,Its a great idea.
83,41,Why does this person have to wear masks? Is this a good idea or a bad idea?
83,46,"That makes sense. I think that a person can't force someone else to do something they're not a member of, because it's a negative."
83,47,It's very interesting. If it's not an obvious difference in size you don't want to fight because it's not very effective. It's also not that obvious. You should probably get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on Amazon.
83,48,I think the article you used to quote is a little confusing but is it a good idea for you to ask your father about this thing that your dad's family would be surprised how he can't say this stuff?
83,51,"I was going to post a picture of a cat in a mask, and when I did it, a cat in a mask I bought just got to know me a little better.

83,52,"I was just a small kid, but I knew how to put a mask on in school."
83,57,Why did they say this? Because they can't be more convincing?
83,65,I'm not sure what the original title of the article is.
94,83,"I believe that he's trying to do some bad stuff. IANAL - Huge Covid fail to have Santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask i'm not saying it's a bad actor, just that it's so hard for me to get involved in a movie."
98,83,It would be a good idea to get a mask similar to a hulk mask and put it on immediately.
83,16,"Its hard to have a self awareness with a mask. A mask can cause a problem in your family, but the fact that people do wear masks with an actual mask makes it hard for them to deal with."
83,22,"I just have this same thought... I love this article so much, but I am afraid of putting some things into my face that my father isn't going to like."
83,41,"I think a good idea to ask your father is to buy a mask in a more subtle way than the article says, but I'd just make a small change in how he thinks and put on it, but I think that's too bad."
83,46,"Well, maybe. But I'm not a huge fan of them either. But a little."
83,47,You should get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on Amazon.
83,48,So what? Is he a bad person? Is he a douche? Is he trying to get to the top of the news and make the world a better place? Is he a good idea? Is he the one who started out as an actor? Is he a good guy?
83,51,"""Why does this person have to wear masks?"""
83,52,I can't believe how many times a redditor has called out a single savage that was really attempting to make a joke.
83,57,I think the title of the article is incorrect. Having a large head is more important than having a big head.
83,65,I feel like I'm reading the article incorrectly and am not even sure what the original title of the article is.
94,83,"If he wants to be a superhero, he will make you like him as a superhero, or as a comic book character."
98,83,"A lot of these questions come up in a variety of forms, including a few oblivious ones (those that are more commonly described, but that don't come up in this sort of context)."
83,16,"That's very confusing and I think you're wrong. He was being sexist, and it seems like you think the article is wrong. You were being silly and not going to be helpful."
83,22,"I'm not sure if I can relate to this, but what's this? Why is everyone in this thread so brashly asking if there's any possible'really good' or 'unsexy' ways they can actually wear the masks? Isn't there some way that they can wear the masks without seeing it on?"
83,41,"A large head is more important than a big head, but you need a big head. And it doesn't matter if it's for a movie or for a movie, it's the other way around."
83,46,I'm not sure why this is a great thing. I had a lot of trouble with the post.
83,47,"What does the phrase ""mask up"" have to do with that..."
83,48,I think this would be a good idea. I'm worried that he might have some problems that he'd be trying to fix.
83,51,I feel like my father doesn't even seem to realize how important his role in the movie is. He just thinks it's a joke to make people think the same way? Does he really have to be a bad actor?
83,52,>I believe that he's trying to do some bad stuff. IANAL - Huge Covid fail to have Santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
83,57,"This guy may be trying to make the world a better place, but he's trying to make things better. He needs to go and get one."
83,65,"This is an article about a child who has a large head - the ""mask is a joke"" is one of the most interesting things about a child's personality. You're probably right that it is something that is really important, especially considering how big your head is."
94,83,"I am not saying that this quote is silly. I am saying that it is hilarious to say, ""If he wants to be a superhero, he will make you like him as a superhero, or as a comic book character."""
98,83,"I'm a big man, and I a little taller than that. So, I don't know what I'm asking here."
83,16,Is there any way that I can do this without the mask?
83,22,"I feel like the article is misleading, but I’m going to say that it is the most common reason people wear masks. But as an adult, I don’t think it makes it up to me unless it is actually related to my stance on something."
83,41," ""You should get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on amazon. So what? Is he a bad person? Is he a douche? Is he a good guy? Is he trying to get to the top of the news and make the world a better place?"""
83,46,"The movie was supposed to be sexy and a bit obnoxious. Then this post came about. Honestly, I'm pretty sure he was trying to make people think it was a joke and it did not. It was the original title."
83,47,"Yes, you are absolutely right. A large head is more important than a big head, but a big head isn't important. A big head is important. It doesn't mean that you don't have to get a big head to make you look like someone you aren't going to be. You should get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on Amazon. So what? Is he a bad person? Is he a douche? Is he a good guy?"
83,48,"Considering that Santa's head is an important part of his personality, I'm going to a different discussion."
83,51,I just learned that the article that I just read was about how important the role of the person was in the movie. The title of the article was:
83,52,"I'm an adult who wears masks for Christmas. I have always wanted to be a big man, but I don't have the money."
83,57,">You should get a mask resembling one of those you can buy on Amazon. So what? Is he a bad person? Is he a douche? Is he a good idea? Is he the one who started out as an actor? Is he a good guy? ""Why does this person have to wear masks?"""
83,65,"I think the most important thing to realize is that this is about people who are the craziest of people, a joke, a narcissist, a nutjob, a prick, a fuckton of shit."
94,83,"I think I'm gonna be a dreadful santa, but you just got an idea of the title."
98,83,">I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that that a person's body is more prone to sex than a mask. I think the best way to look nice is to use a mask, because it means something to them and looks more attractive. I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that a person's body is more prone to sex than a mask. I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that that a person's facial mask."
83,16,"The article isn't misleading, it is more a response to his point. Despite what you've said and you cite a lot of information, it has nothing to do with whether or not he should be a bad person. I mean, this is a big satan movie, he's probably been trying to make people think this is a joke, but I really can't say for sure, but if he's trying to make people think he's trying to fix some big satan stuff that's already being made up"
83,22,>I feel like my father doesn't even seem to realize how important his role in the movie is. He just thinks it's a joke to make people think the same way? Does he really have to be a bad actor?
83,41,The only thing I'm really unsure about is whether I'm going to do this. I'm just going to try and make the point that I can't be an actor.
83,46,">What does the phrase ""mask up"" have to do with that... I feel like my father doesn't even seem to realize how important his role in the movie is. He just thinks it's a joke to make people think the same way? Does he really have to be a bad actor?"
83,47,"It's not the hulk, it's your face."
83,48,I don't think that the article makes any sense.
83,51,"I'm so excited about Christmas that I've got a friend who wears a mask and his mother always said ""what is this?"" He told me he's worried about the ""mask up"" in the movie. I can't imagine being scared of her being in a costume with a hoody."
83,52,I think that the idea of having a big face is also interesting to me because it's not a joke and doesn't fit the topic of the post.
83,57,"I have a lot of confidence. I don't like to think about this article, but it is kind of disturbing that people in general seem to have the same sense of humor as I do. I have to wonder if I should wear masks in other areas of my life?"
83,65,"This is like saying: ""What does the phrase ""mask up"" have to do with that... I feel like my father doesn't even seem to realize how important his role in the movie is. He just thinks it's a joke to make people think the same way? Does he really have to be a bad actor?"""
