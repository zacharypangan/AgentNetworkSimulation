70,59,i flew for the first time since march it was mostly fine but some folks wore their masks as chin slings i have glasses and wore my mask over my nose for hours and they didn t fog up i also had plenty of oxygen over the nose people
74,59,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

59,45,"This is exactly the part I'm afraid is missing, and when they say you can't wear a mask it's pretty much just a general rule. The fact is, you can wear your mask in the air but at the same time be in your helmet. There is a lot of pressure there to wear a mask in air."

59,35,I don't get the question of why the parents aren't vaccinated. They're not vaccinated.
59,45,The reason you're getting more information from the article is because there is no shortage of medical equipment to wear the masks in the air and the shortage of medical equipment for doctors causing these issues is because of it.
