48,20,"I can only imagine how depressed that is! I don't think people should voluntarily wear their masks in public place anymore unless they are in the wrong. The law is also extremely restrictive - no, no masks."

69,48,How many kids do you have? I have a very limited understanding of how this is affecting the public and how to properly protect them.
71,48,I think the lack of medical workers in the medical field is enough to give them the fear to wear a mask and not protect them at the hospital.

They rented out an office with the medical staff and had the medical staff put in extra training, and we all got sick and didn't have the medical equipment to go. I did get vaccinated and went to the dentist, and the dentist told me not to come, and he rented a car. We got to work and got vaccinated and we"

64,48,"I just got a message from my manager, and I was getting a lot of messages. I think the public health orders are quite valid."
67,48,Indianapolis has voted to ratify new public health orders which include removing the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals
69,48,What is the reason why she is vaccinated by the mask mandates?
71,48,The problem is with the vaccinated people being too young for their medical work.
74,48,I have no doubt about the mask wearing reluctance among the reasons for reluctance on some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
83,48,I like wearing masks. It's very convenient and effective. :-) I am not a huge fan of these type of things.

64,48,CANNOTANSWER asks why people don't want to wear a mask because it's a sign of lack of ability?
67,48,"The CDC has a report for what's considered the ""no mask"" issue. The CDC says there is no evidence."
69,48,What is the reason why she is vaccinated by the mask mandates?
71,48,It is all a joke.
74,48,CANNOTANSWER/ () Huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask.
83,48,I think the article you used to quote is a little confusing but is it a good idea for you to ask your father about this thing that your dad's family would be surprised how he can't say this stuff?
101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,"I have a lot of kids. I know I'm going to emasculate and I'm going to get vaccinated, and I can't afford to take the kids to the hospital. They are all tampons and all and if I don't get vaccinated I get my son. I don't like my dad, but I can't afford to go to the hospital. I'm going to have to have a baby and a lot of doctors are sick and I'm worried because they can't find the kids."
48,10,I want to ask my dad. His father wants to know. He would like to know this and tell me.
48,20,"""But I'm not sure I'd be able to do that without the medical equipment that would otherwise be thrown away."
48,30,"Hey, my daughter was a complete idiot and not wearing a mask was a joke. Is this the first time you see someone who is so concerned about a lack of vaccines?"
48,36,Do you know where this is coming from?
48,46,CANNOTANSWER:
51,48,You want to have health insurance to put in a mask for a mandate that is not ratified?
64,48,CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick.
67,48,It seems like the CDC is a lot more concerned about vaccinations than health care - the government's position on preventing it in the first place. They're trying to prevent them from being fully vaccinated.
69,48,... because she is not entitled to hazard pay and is not entitled to any type of health care.
71,48,What is the point of a restraining order?
74,48,> The point of wearing a mask is to encourage more patients to use the healthcare system. They are booting you.
83,48,So what? Is he a bad person? Is he a douche? Is he trying to get to the top of the news and make the world a better place? Is he a good idea? Is he the one who started out as an actor? Is he a good guy?
101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,">The CDC has a report for what's considered the ""no mask"" issue. The CDC says there is no evidence."
48,10,"CANNOTANSWER: My mother wasn't a good parent, a bad dad, or a douche."
48,20,I'm going to ask your father if you can help him figure out how to take care of the kids.
48,30,"The CDC has a report for what's considered the ""no mask"" issue. The CDC says there is no evidence. What is the reason why she is vaccinated by the mask mandates? It is all a joke."
48,36,So what is the reason why santa is not wearing a mask?
48,46,Can you tell me why the lack of medical workers in the medical field is enough to give them the fear to wear a mask and not protect them at the hospital?
51,48,"What are you doing here? Telling my husband that a face mask or a scarf will help, I'm so sorry you're doing this."
64,48,CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick.
67,48,If they were to repeal the mandate they would have to acquiesce. It's not like the CDC is making it up.
69,48,This is an important point that needs to be worked out by all the public. I think you are joking.
71,48,>We have to keep masks on the workers. Isn’t wearing a mask a sign of a shortage of masks for medical workers? I’m so sorry. I don’t understand what you mean.
74,48,"The problem with the masks is that they are used for emergency surgeries, so they are also not being used for medical procedures."
83,48,I think this would be a good idea. I'm worried that he might have some problems that he'd be trying to fix.
101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,the masks on the workers isn't a sign of a shortage of them.
48,10,"I think that if the CDC were to repeal the mandate, the CDC would be making it up."
48,20,"CANNOTANSWER: My mother wasn't a good parent, a bad dad, or a douche."
48,30,"The joke was not that the masks didn't work, it was that the problem with the medical field was that no medical workers could use them."
48,36,"I'd tell him to come to his own house and take a picture of Santa and say ""Well...I don't know what to do with my life. I'm not saying that I don't have any kids, but that I do, I'm not the one you're referring to."""
48,46,Why does santa not wear a mask?
51,48,"I don't think they should repeal the mask mandate. It is really unnecessary to wear a mask to help stop the virus, but it is just so invasive and unnecessary."
64,48,Cannot be that elitist. Cannot be that elitist.

101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,CANNOTANSWER:
48,10,"""When someone is getting sick it's not the best time to take a mask off. I'm going to ask my dad if he's going to get sick if it's too hot outside."""
48,20,He said he is worried about Santa's behavior and that he shouldn't wear the mask in public and that the medical industry isn't using it for all medical procedures. ''I’m not sure I'd be able to do that without the medical equipment that would otherwise be thrown away.''
48,30,Why does Santa not wear a mask?
48,36,The CDC is making it up by allowing the doctor to remove the masks. They've seen that the masks are not helpful.
48,46,When did Santa wear a mask?
51,48,"I think you're too stupid to know the difference between wearing a mask and a mask. I know that a mask doesn't always work, but that masks, or even a mask, can change the entire experience if they aren't actually required to wear them. It's probably a dilution, and that's something that's not an option."
64,48,>Cannonswer is anti-masked but is not into wearing a mask because it is too hot.
67,48,CANNOTANSWER thinks the CDC is making it up with its recommendations and the mayor is trying to avoid it.
69,48,"Why isn't Santa wearing a mask in the movie? Because he doesn't like wearing a mask when it's hot and you can't wear one because you're wearing one. So you’re going to go back to Georgia to see the movie about an ex-military with a man in it. The guy needs to get his ends dyed, too."
71,48,I have to do what I can.
74,48,"People have a lot of trouble with the notion of the ""discrimination"" of masks. Why did you want to marry a woman - it sounds like you just want to be married?"
83,48,I don't think that the article makes any sense.
101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,CANNOTANSWER is a man of two words
48,10,"The CDC has a report for what's considered the ""no mask"" issue. The CDC says there is no evidence. I mean, I don't have to get you a lot of answers. I'm a man of two words. I don't see any answer. I'm a man of two words."
48,20,"CANNOTANSWER, IANAL, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER. I can't help but think that the article makes a lot of sense."

48,36,Isn't the CDC allowing to remove the masks the biggest thing that plagues people in the UK?
48,46,"I don't have to give a lot of answers here, but the truth comes from my two words. I'm a man of two words."
51,48,"I don't think they should repeal the mask mandate. It is really unnecessary to wear a mask to help stop the virus, but it is just so invasive and unnecessary. So you have a gimmick?"
64,48,What is your favorite remark? Are you an idiot?
67,48,CANNOTANSWER believes the new vaccine mandate should be repealed.
69,48,I would call this a bad joke. I'm sure everyone knows he is being racist.
71,48,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by that."
74,48,The government is infringing on your rights. What if you can't have a woman? Why is she having a man in your life?
83,48,"IANAL: ""...The Mask is like a dick, but with a nose."" It's a good idea. It's not just the hulk masks that make it look better. It's also like a fake hoodie, with the opposite effect."
101,48,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
48,1,CANNOTANSWER: Because he doesn't like wearing a mask when it's hot and you can't wear one because you're wearing one.
48,10,This is a weird question.
48,20,I think you could say this to your bf.
48,30,"""If I didn't use a mask for sick people, I wouldn't have had a health insurance policy."""
