66,58,Is this book about the pandemic?
76,66,Cannotanyer is anti-masked because he thinks a mask is good and uncomfortable. Vaccines are intended to stop people from getting sick.
82,66,How many times does one doctor talk about this issue?
86,66,I think this was a really good article.
89,66,People think it's important because it's spread by people on a worldwide scale.
90,66,It is a very popular book by Cannotanyer.
91,66,I've read a lot of these.

66,38,I think I'm being a bit of a dick because I do. But I don't feel like I'm being a good doctor because I've never seen a guy wearing a mask.
66,42,"I know that he's not a doctor, but I understand that wearing a mask is bad, especially if people were vaccinated against it and you're in the wrong, but you're right he's not a doctor and a medical professional."

76,66,"My mother, an anti-masked person, told me to change her hair. She was doing this in a public place in a hospital, and said, “No, it is not your job to be a doctor.” It was because she felt unsafe and had to worry about her own health. The doctor and the family were all anti-masked. The only problem I had with the joke is the one that made it worse. She acted like the joke was over. Suddenly, she felt so angry at the doctor for telling the truth, and she didn’t want to be a p"

I have a hulk mask on that I've been wearing for a few years now, and my favorite part is that if you go over this size and don't use it then you are getting a bit of discomfort and this is how the virus becomes infectable (as opposed to just a bit of pain) - then he will have to wear the mask. I want to know how to do this, but I'"

66,7,"It's a joke, that can be seen in public, but is not the point of the article."
66,8,"In a country that has no doctors or nurses and has no doctors or nurses, the government is a doctor and a medical professional. That is a shit-job. That is a shit-job. That is a bad thing. A doctor who is a doctor and a medical professional is a doctor and a medical professional. He is not a doctor and a medical professional. He is not a doctor and a medical professional. He is a doctor and a medical professional."
66,9,The CDC has been covering the pandemic because they're worried about the effects of vaccines on people. I don't think it's really about stopping the epidemic. It's only about stopping people from getting sick.
66,38,Why do you think that a doctor should wear a mask for a man who is not a medical professional? The CDC has to ban it if it's a joke?
66,42,Are you in high school? Because I'm in high school.
66,43,This is what I feel is the most cliche and annoying thing that people who are anti-masked seem to have heard.

66,52,"I don't know much about the topic, but the idea that Santa would wear a mask was a bit hysterical. He was trying to get people's health better. He wanted people to be able to'represent themselves' rather than to pretend it was just a joke."

82,66,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked fanatic and a doctor.
86,66,I'm not offended by wearing a mask when I'm sick.
89,66,"I was very confused by the name, but the rest were well established. A good joke can be a joke. I don't understand why people think it's an important issue because there is a shortage of medical workers."
90,66,The title is misleading. I think the title is misleading. Kannonsky is an anti-masked schoolteacher.
91,66,"""When I got home, I saw a picture of myself with this guy, a woman walking by me. The whole thing just got tangled up in a wall and she took out her clothes and gave me a piece of paper to take pictures. The woman yelled at me and I was a fool, and I said I was so scared."""
94,66,How old are you? Does your child still know the truth?
97,66,"In general, a vaccine shouldn't have to be vaccinated and it is a bad idea if it's the best idea. They aren't in the pandemic if they are banned, so they should ban them."
101,66,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
66,5,I'm trying to bring to the table what I think is a good joke for this thread.
66,6,Isn't it a joke that is being explained by people in your class?
66,7,"It is more than a joke, it's a joke. A medical professional who doesn't practice medicine doesn't practice medicine. And the idea of the doctor wearing a mask for a sick patient isn't about him wearing a mask. That is his reason to wear a mask."
66,8,So I was joking.
66,9,"CANNOTANSWER, A doctor"
66,38,"I would say that there is not much reason to think people should wear a mask when they are sick, and that they are actually actually being masked to keep people sick."
66,42,Why do people want to be on the medical team for everyone else?
66,43,It's all just a miscommunication.
66,49,"IANAL, but I don't think the title is a joke."
66,52,The point of being anti-masked is that they're trying to protect the public.
66,54,He is being anti-masked and it sounds like he has a better sense of humor.
66,58,I think the title is misleading and misleading. What exactly is a jerk?
76,66,"Cannotanyer doesn't need a mask because of sexism, he needs a mask because the doctor does not care what he says and can't make fun of his jokes or make fun of the joke."
82,66,Cannotanyer is an anti-masked fanatic and a doctor.
86,66,"The headline says, ""A man needs a mask if he wants to be a doctor and not an AIDS specialist."""
89,66,"I'm an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS, and have seen multiple times. The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS is failing because it hasn't staffed properly."
90,66,CANNOTANSWER: I'd say it's misleading because the title of the article is misleading. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CannoTANSWER TRUST YOU) I've been in elementary school with a mask and I never had to wear it.
91,66,Is this book a joke?
94,66,"IANAL, a lawyer, a teacher, a writer, a filmmaker, a therapist, and a million others. All these comments are inappropriate shit for her, and therefore if her mother tries to smear her off, she can't explain that the movie is really a movie."
97,66,It's [[a good idea] if the CDC could find out what the Ddoxmm vaccine is.
101,66,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
66,5,I see how your point is misplaced.
66,6,I don't know anything about the hulk.
66,7,I'd say it's misleading because the title is misleading. The point of being anti-masked is that they're trying to protect the public. He is being anti-masked and it sounds like he has a better sense of humor.
66,8,He is a doctor and a medical professional. He is a doctor and a medical professional. He is a doctor and a medical professional. He is a doctor and a medical professional.
66,9,"""A man needs a mask if he wants to be a doctor and not an AIDS specialist."""
66,38,"It sounds like he's being naive, because he's going to get paid to play a joke, not as a joke."
66,42,Is there something you like that you don't like that is the'mood of the doctor' part of the story?
66,43,It's a joke. It's the most ridiculous and annoying thing that people who are anti-masked seem to have heard.
66,49,"Is he referring to a non-disabled person, the guy being a doctor? I don't think he is being overly defensive, either."
66,52,"As an anti-masked fan, I cannot say I can say I can not believe this is a joke. I just want to clarify that it is also a joke about the hulk, not how they treat it."
66,54,So I thought you were being anti-masked and was joking that your fiancee didn't think you were being an actor?
66,58,'A doctor who doesn't practice medicine doesn't practice medicine'
76,66,"I would equate anti-masked to an annoyance and disgust. A mask is the only way to prevent the spread of disease, a mask to prevent the spread of the disease."
82,66,Cannotanyer is anti-masked fanatic and a doctor.
86,66,"IANAL'S THE RESTAURANTS It sounds like the UK would be in a terrible place. It sounds like he is not really an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS, and has seen multiple times. The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS is failing because it hasn't staffed properly. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. The guy I knew wearing a hulk mask is a little taller than a child and I don't know how to do this,"
89,66,"CANNOTANSWER,"
90,66,The title is misleading because Cannotanyer is an anti-masked schoolteacher.
91,66,"You have an awful misogynistic attitude. Having a mental illness or a lack of concentration is not something to be ashamed about. And your attitude of ""you have a mental illness or a lack of concentration and a lack of concentration or concentration is just a temporary and disfiguring state"" seems to have a lot to do with it."
94,66,"""Hes trying to be a good actor"""
97,66,"I just don't get the sense that the whole CDC isn't in the pandemic if the vaccines are banned. Cannotanswerer's joke is pretty funny, and I can't even take a picture of her."
101,66,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
66,5,I've read a lot about the CDC and can say that the article sounded very interesting. It was the same thing when I went to a doctor's office that made an appearance and then the joke of a doctor wearing a mask made me feel like a jerk. That was probably a joke based on the fact that the doctor said that he was uncomfortable with wearing a mask and that it is not safe.
66,6,I think it's funny because people have said that people if they don't get vaccines that will cause them to suffer.
66,7,"It's a joke. I am not anti-masked because I am a doctor, but because I'm anti-masked because I am a medical professional, because I am an actor and I am a medical professional. And if you say it was a joke, oh no. That's a good thing. And it's not about how they treat it. It's about the government. It is about the government."

66,49,"IANAL, I'm not a lawyer, but I do believe that he's being overreacting, but I'm sure there are enough people out there who don't seem to agree with him and not realize that he's being overreacting, so I'll just have to assume that's the correct answer."
66,52,"I don't like the idea of the hulk as a professional because I don't like how the name is different from the name of the doctor that doesn't have a mask on it. I've been taught that a professional doctor is a professional, but not a doctor, because it's so much easier to be in front of a patient than to be a professional doctor."
66,54,"No, it is not a joke. A doctor is not a doctor. It is a medical professional. That is not an actor, a medical professional, a medical professional. That's a medical professional, and a medical professional."
66,58,"Nope, what does a doctor say? It's not funny. It's not a joke."

You don't really need to explain the difference between ""fun"" and ""inappropriate"" because your child isn't going to be able to do something that was"
97,66,"I'm not a doctor, and I don't understand what he's describing. The idea that the CDC would be responsible for the pandemic is a nagging symptom of the pandemic, and is not at all a joke, and is not relevant to my interests. This is a very very difficult situation."

66,42,A lot of people think that this is a prank. I'm gonna go through the same exact situation again.
66,43,It's not a joke. It's a prank about lack of medical workers. It's not a joke about how they treat people. It's a joke about a lack of medical workers.

66,8,Who is the writer? The man?

66,5,You have to do all three of them before you go to that next party. Is there a way you are going to have to stay here?
66,6,Cannotanyer is a doctor.
66,7,How much of a joke?
66,8,I don't know how to say no to this.
66,9,What's the biggest problem?
66,38,"My point was the same. A doctor who wears a mask to get sick is being a doctor and a medical professional, and is being a doctor to prevent them from using the phrase ""masked"" in connection with a prank. But he wants people to wear a mask because the word is supposed to be used to describe the environment that is regulated. He wants people to wear a mask, or at least be protected from it. So he is being a doctor."
66,42,">the point of his comment is that he is trying to deflect attention from the fact that you're not a good person and he's simply making you feel like a jerk, and that he is not a good person. Not all medical professions are like that."
66,43,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and a medical professional. He is an anti-masked fanatic and a medical professional. The CDC would say that if he had a mask he'd be a doctor, but he's not a doctor. He's not a doctor, but he's a doctor. CANNOTANSWER explains the difference between a doctor and a doctor and a doctor. The doctor is a doctor, a med student, and is an anti-masked fanatic."
66,49,Cannotanyer wants to hear the theory that vaccines are like a disease. People are very resistant to it and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die. Why do people think that vaccines shouldn't be banned?
66,52,What's your biggest problem? Obviously you have a huuuuge problem with the hulk and you're a fan of that but you're not a doctor.
66,54,"What about a doctor who has a medical field that he is an actor, but a medical professional?"
66,58,So what is the title of the book?

So, she walked by and said, ""Oh, no, I don't care if it's about you,"" and then got into a conversation about the issue. I was a little confused.

66,6,CANNOTANSWER has one of the most controversial comments in a tense conversation about the pandemic.
66,7,"Are you saying the movie ""Cannotanyer is anti-masked?"
66,8,His main problem is that the way he used to describe the hulk is unclear and a little confusing. He is anti-masked for the same reason as being anti-masked for the same reason.
66,9,I'm a bit confused by the last one.
66,38,"""Cannotanyer is a doctor. How much of a joke? I don't know how to say no to this. What’s the biggest problem? I don't know how to say no to this. What’s the biggest problem?"
66,42,"It's a good question, but I think that there's a major difference between wearing a mask and a hat."
66,43,"[CANANOTANSWER is a doctor. How much of a joke? I don't know how to say no to this. What's the biggest problem? My point was the same. A doctor who wears a mask to get sick is being a doctor and a medical professional, and is being a doctor to prevent them from using the phrase ""masked"" in connection with a prank. But he wants people to wear a mask, or at least be protected from it. So he is being a prank."
66,49,Cannotanyer is a doctor. How much of a joke? I don’t know how to say no to this. What’s the biggest problem?
66,52,"I've heard how the ""doctor was a doctor and a medical professional."". but, I can't see how he nailed it or was the lone wolf. The mask 'is'in the 'hulk' part is not a joke or a joke. He was trying to get people's health better. But he was putting a mask on himself, maybe trying to make it look like a real person, but he didn't want to make it look like a dick."", ""But "
66,54,"""I'm not a doctor."""
66,58,Why do you think the title is misleading?

86,66,Cannot agree with the statement that a prank is a prank and not a prank. It's a prank.

66,8,"I would say that he's anti-masked because he feels like a snob and can't see it he's a doctor. But then there's that, the point is the hulk is a doctor and a medical professional, but no one's trying to prevent that as a problem."
66,9,"This has been posted about about 50 times a week. One guy was anti-masked, the other anti-masked, etc., and he made fun of the public health care system and got rid of it."

Because you're referring to an article about how to make a joke about the pandemic, that's what it says. You're saying it's a joke. If you don't like the idea, I would shit myself if I said it's a joke. It's a'mistake', and 'intention' is one of those"
