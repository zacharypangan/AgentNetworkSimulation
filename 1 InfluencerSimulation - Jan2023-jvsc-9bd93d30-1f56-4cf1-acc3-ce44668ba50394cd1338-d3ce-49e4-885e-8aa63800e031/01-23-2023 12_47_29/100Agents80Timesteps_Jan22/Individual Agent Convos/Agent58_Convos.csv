66,58,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked fanatic and a medical professional. Cannotanyer is a doctor and a medical professional.
71,58,"""Cannan is one of two examples of what can be used in a joke:"
85,58,CANNOTANSWER IS A PICK STREAK
89,58,"CannonanSWER, IANAL, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER Fuck UP IM JUST A COUNT!"
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,"Cannotanyer is an anti-vaccine advocate, not a lawyer. Cannnan is a good speaker, but has a lack of a legal background."
58,5,The article is about how people need to know that this is illegal and there is a shortage in doctors and nurses.
58,19,I am a medical professional.
58,24,"The title of the book is misleading because it's misleading. In the UK, ""Cease is a legal thing to do"" is a form of ""not allowing people to wear a mask in public."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannnan_is_a_professional_doctor/)"
58,46,"A Doctor tries to sell out the hospital to a private company who doesn't pay for medical malpractice, so he's the one being sued."
58,53,"If people are using a mask to scare people, do they want it on their skin? Do they want it on their body? Do they want to give them the medical certificate to tell them that they don't need it?"
66,58,"I don't understand the meaning of the word masked. You need to think about the actual word and how it relates to the people that can wear it, as opposed to the type of person that can wear it."
71,58,"Cannan is an anti-vaccine advocate, not a lawyer."
85,58,"If a medical worker does not have the required medical certificate, the employer is responsible for bringing the case against the doctor."
89,58,"“I see no problem with people wearing a mask in public unless they are battling an AIDS pandemic, because they don't want to risk their life and their health, so I don't wear them. I don’t want the stigma to continue, even if I don’t wear them.”"
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,> he's against doctors wearing masks when they were sick.
58,5,The title suggests that he is in his early 20s. He's an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS. Cannotanyer is a doctor. He doesn't understand how to understand the word 'cease'. He just doesn't know how to know what it means.
58,19,[Third amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.P.H.B.E. Mask)
58,24,A doctor who isn't a doctor should probably be ashamed that there is a shortage of medical care in the UK.
58,46,I see a huge problem with the current system and I think the doctor needs to be given a restraining order to keep the medical workers safe.
58,53,"""Fuck UP IM JUST A COUNT!"""
66,58,"So I am a doctor, a doctor, a doctor."
71,58,"CANNOTANSWER says that Canna is an anti-vaccine advocate, not a lawyer."
85,58,"A lot of employers in England make restraining orders because they have an insurance policy, but this one is based on false information."
89,58,>Isn't it a huge deal that people still do not wear a mask in public unless they are battling an AIDS pandemic?
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,Is there an article in the article you might want to look at?
58,5,Is there a need for a restraining order from the NHS?
58,19,"'I am a medical professional. The title of the book is misleading because it's misleading. In the UK, ""Cease is a legal thing to do"" is a form of ""not allowing people to wear a mask in public."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.P.H.B.E. Mask)"
58,24,"I'm a doctor and I've seen several people put a mask on themselves to fight with a medical doctor. Honestly, this could be a very cliched name."
58,46,IANAL: CANNOTANSWER: I am a medical professional.
58,53,"""How does everybody wear a mask when they are sick. It’s pretty common, if you ask me. I have no idea why doctors can’t wear them because of personal reasons. The title of the book is misleading because it's misleading. In the UK, ""Cease is a legal thing to do"" is a form of ""not allowing people to wear a mask in public."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.P.H.B.E. Mask) A doctor who isn’t a doctor."
66,58,I have a friend in college who has a problem with this topic.
71,58,"""The problem is not with the pandemic. It's more with the lack of time to do vaccines."""
85,58,CANNOTANSWER IS A PICK STREAK
89,58,"CANNOTANSWER: A large number of people will wear masks for work and if a patient refuses to wear them, that's a big problem."
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,Why does a doctor and a medical professional have to wear a mask at work?
58,5,"No. Cannotanyer's post is misleading because it doesn't support his position. In fact, he's being a medical professional. He was in fact an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS."
58,19,"IANAL: ""I am a doctor and I've seen several people put a mask on themselves to fight with a medical doctor."
58,24,"A doctor who isn't a doctor is an anti-vaccine advocate. A lot of employers in England make restraining orders because they have an insurance policy, but this one is based on false information."
58,46,"I think it's a good idea and isn't a sexist joke, but it should be addressed as such."
58,53,Is this the same doctor who says the H.P.H.B.E. mask is a joke and tries to portray a patient's medical expertise as a professional or just a prank?
66,58,It's a lot more than that. It's about health and not just the people who are immune to it.
71,58,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
85,58,It seems like there are a number of reasons to deny an employer the right to refuse a restraining order.
89,58,CANNOTANSWER:
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,the author of the article is anti-vaccine advocate and is a doctor and a medical professional.
58,5,"[Wiley]: ""There's no good idea, and I don't have any information that supports the claim."
58,19,I think a good argument can be drawn if the doctor was getting sick.
58,24,"There is a book called ""Cast Strikes Back"" that is very similar to that of Cannonswers, but isn't based on facts. It is misleading because it says ""Cast Strikes Back"" and claims ""I'm not a doctor"" isn't a legal word to do."
58,46,Its the CDC's vaccine list. That's where this is coming from
58,53,IANAL has written a lot about the UK's medical shortage:
66,58,"The doctor in the article said ""He's a good teacher, and a medical professional."" Not only did he wear a mask while sick, he also made it clear that he thinks it's a prank to spread the virus by letting people get in."
71,58,Why do I feel like I can't explain it? Because I feel like I'm doing it wrong.
85,58,"I would say: ""cannotanyer and Kannonsky are anti-masked school teachers."""
89,58,why do people wear masks in public?
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,"CANNOTANSWER has written a lot about the UK's medical shortage. The doctor who said ""He's a good teacher, and a medical professional."""
58,5,CANNOTANSWER:
58,19,"IANAL: ""I think it's a good idea and isn't a sexist joke."
58,24,"IANAL: ""Cannotanyer and Kannonsky are anti-masked school teachers."""
58,46,A restraining order is not a valid one because it's an anti-vaccine issue. It's a rebuttal.
58,53,">The problem isn't with the pandemics, but rather with the shortage of medicines."
66,58,"It's really a joke, I mean, that's funny and funny. But if it's an honest question and people think that, why is it a joke? Because you're referring to an article about how to make a joke about the pandemic, that's what it says. You're saying it's a joke. If you don't like the idea, I would shit myself if I said it's a joke. It's a'mistake', and 'intention' is one of those"
71,58,Cannan explains the topic. Cannan's point is that he is an anti-vaccine advocate and is a lawyer who pranks a lot to his employers.
85,58,"Cannonsky, Kannonsky and Cannotanyer are anti-masked school teachers. I don't have a prank."
89,58,Who does this interview include? Are you really talking about the NHS shortage?
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,It’s actually a real thing. It’s a real thing.
58,5,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS.
58,19,"CANNOTANSWER is an anti-vaccine advocate and a lawyer. He cites an article and a fact in the title: ""Ask the doctor why it isn't a valid medical malpractice suit. In fact, it's called a restraining order."""
58,24,Why would you want to fight that?
58,46,Cannon's first question: Are there any problems with people not wearing masks?
58,53,">I'm not a doctor, but a medical professional."
66,58,I'm a doctor and a medical professional.
71,58,I don't know what you mean by a joke?
85,58,CANNOTANSWER IS A PICK STREAK
89,58,It's because the NHS is unable to meet demand due to the shortage.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,4,"The title is misleading. Cannonsky is an anti-vaccine advocate, not a lawyer."
58,5,>Is this a problem with the restraining order from the NHS?''
58,19,What is the general consensus on 'Cease is a legal thing to do'?
58,24,>Cannotanyer is an anti-vaccine advocate and is a lawyer.
58,46,Is it the correct word?
58,53,"I think I can read this from another perspective. If I woke up in a hospital that is literally full of people wearing masks, it would be hard for me to think I could live without them. I just don't think it's funny."
66,58,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked fanatic and a medical professional.
