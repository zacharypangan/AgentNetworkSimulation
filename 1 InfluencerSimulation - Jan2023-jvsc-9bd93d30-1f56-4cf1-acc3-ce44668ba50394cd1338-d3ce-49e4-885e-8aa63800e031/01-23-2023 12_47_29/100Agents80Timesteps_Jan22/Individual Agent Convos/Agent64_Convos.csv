64,48,"I just got a message from my manager, and I was getting a lot of messages. I think the public health orders are quite valid."
64,50,How can you go about wearing your mask to work again because you can't afford to get sick?
64,51,CANNOTANSWER -
64,54,why don't get vaccinated?
67,64,"When did mask mandates become a law in the US? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,64,"Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated."
76,64,">how about don't touch my face unless you have disinfected your hands recently and you only need to wear a mask when in close quarters with someone else', 'i think you need a face mask?'"
82,64,Hi there. Vaccination is like a disease. People are very resistant to it and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die.
85,64,"> So, how's your mask on? You should wear a mask, because I'm not a healthcare worker and I can't make my mask work for an hour! Well there are many medical workers that don't wear a mask while working, but do wear it when they're stressed - that's what the company is doing. And a doctor who was trained to wear one during surgery and was given no reason to wear one during an accident may also be booted, which may lead to the restraining order."
90,64,How are you being treated in school?
91,64,CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU
64,2,CANNOTANSWER wants to go about vaccinating everyone. What can he afford?
64,11,>because I'm not a healthcare worker and I can't make my mask work for an hour!
64,14,CANNOTANSWER gives an answer to a question about the health order.
64,17,CANNOTANSWER gets sick and wants to get vaccinated.
64,19,"CANNOTANSWER is telling his boss that wearing a mask on your face isn't an option, so he should wear it while working. It's more efficient than a mask in front of the manager if he can get sick."
64,24,"CANNOTANSWER gets sick with a mask because he can't afford it, because his employer doesn't want to give him a restraining order for doing so."
64,35,"You should wear your mask at work, not in close quarters with other workers and not close to your body."
64,41,CANNOTANSWER is telling CANNOTANSWER about getting sick by wearing a mask.
64,42,Cannot afford to get sick because of the lack of work?
64,48,CANNOTANSWER asks why people don't want to wear a mask because it's a sign of lack of ability?
64,50,Isn't the vaccination mandate a big cause of illness?
64,51,"CANNOTANSWER is a very, very, very young, and very poor people."
64,54,CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick.
67,64,"I'm a citizen of the United States. I think a sling or a mask, can still protect against flu. That is, if you do get it right, then that should be it."
71,64,"A few other people in this thread say that the virus is very difficult to recover from and this is why they need to wear a mask. This is also why many people cannot recover from covid, even if they were given a dose that was contaminated, and their body would be infected."
76,64,"I need to think about what my wife would say about a mask to do with her health, as it was in the first place."
82,64,I'd like to ask you if you're anti-masked and that's what you want me to think.
85,64,So are you really a good therapist? I'm a therapist so I have to find an excuse to wear my mask on.
90,64,"What do you think about all the people who wear masks? You say ""I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"""
91,64,What if you can't have a woman? Why is she having a man in your life?
64,2,What does he think is the solution?
64,11,"Because you don't work as a healthcare worker, don't wear a mask."
64,14,I think the message is to say that if you have a job with your hands open you can't get sick with a mask on.
64,17,"I've been feeling sick for about 10 years. You need to make a plan to work through it, as I can't afford a mask"

71,64,>I am not sure how your story fits into this. It is all a joke.
76,64,"So, my dad is a doctor, and I am a doctor. I can tell you, I think we are all not as good at knowing how to get there. Especially if it is a dick. I think if I was a dick, I would have said the same thing in the past but I would be totally wrong. So I reverted to being a doctor with a mask. I reacted badly to it."
82,64,"If the cold wasn't the hotter the more the cold would be the hotter you'd have. You'd have to put your head down and get the body to sweat and burn, which isn't good if you're not vaccinated."
85,64,"I don't really know what to write in this context, but I don't want to make a judgement. I'd like to be sure that I don't let my employer jibe at me about what I should and shouldn't wear in the workplace. I think it's a very common behavior in this industry, and a huge reason for it. I'm still afraid I might have to get out of the hospital for a second, but I think it's probably not that common for them to be a jibe at."
90,64,I am a teacher and I like wearing a mask.
91,64,Can't you believe this was written down by the US government?
64,2,"Cannonswer is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick. I just like to wear masks when I'm sick, but when I'm sick, my job is pretty close to my desk."

64,14,CANNOTANSWER says he is going to try to convince his boss that he can not afford to get sick.
64,17,CANNOTANSWER '. CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can't afford to get sick. He wants to go about vaccinating everyone. What can he afford?
64,19,"My father told me that he was a dick. So he decided to get a doctor vaccinated so he could come in and clean up his illness. So I drank it, it hurt my throat and I couldn't even get out of the hospital. So he resorted to a mask on his face instead of putting on a mask? He's obviously just being sloppy."
64,24,The CDC (CDC.gov) wrote down what a common behavior in the health care industry and that it's a big reason to be not vaccinated.
64,35,Can't you believe this was written down by the US government?
64,41,"[CannonWer]'s boss is trying to convince his boss that wearing a mask on your face isn't an option, so he should wear it while working. It's more efficient than a mask in front of the manager if he can get sick."
64,42,I can understand why you would think your wife would think like this?
64,48,CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick.
64,50,"This is not an uncommon situation, but there is a pretty big question here: How much can someone legally legally afford to pay for their health care without vaccinating them?"
64,51,CANNOTANSWER is trying to convince his boss he can not afford to get sick.
64,54,"How did he decide that was the solution, since you don't work as a healthcare worker, don't wear a mask?"
67,64,CANNOTANSWER OP:
71,64,Vaccination is the way to go. I was told it was in the public interest to get it banned but I'm sure it's not the best practice.
76,64,Why don't you just wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please I do not think there is a better solution.
82,64,Vaccination is like a disease. People are very resistant to it and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die.
