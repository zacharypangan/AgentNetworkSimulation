94,79,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
98,79,due to an obvious difference in size as in body size anti masker reluctantly adjusted his mask responsible citizen is over feet tall big the type of person you don t want to fight unless you absolutely have to
100,79,if i get this covid vaccine i shouldn t have to wear a mask anymore
101,79,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
79,9,If you are willing to spend hours at a factory with a mask on you can make sure you don't go in the middle of a field while a nurse can't see.
79,34,No. You aren't.
79,35,How would you be so sick if santa didn t wear a mask in thanksgivingdayparade?
79,38,"You were the only one who was able to show off your mask? If he doesn't have a mask at work, he's the only one in the whole hospital who doesn't wear one."

79,40,This is a good point. I feel like that isn't how it works.

79,46,What is it you want me to do now? Wear a mask.
79,62,"This is disgraceful why do you not have a mask on you could ve given that bird covid. Unless it s an anti-masker that did it wrong, it should still be on."
79,69,i can imagine santa without a mask. it's a bit like the cactus roosevelt mask you see on the internet. you wear a mask for hours and you don't do much. it just doesn't seem right.
79,72,"This is so disgraceful, it is disgusting, and he does it for no reason."
88,79,I am not so sure about wearing a mask for hours at work.
94,79,"He's obviously a bad actor. You know, the movie that isn't about santa with a mask."
98,79,"... and how is the mask supposed to prevent this? Because the first part in this article is about the masks that are required to have a visible mask, so it is not an obvious difference."

79,9,How do you know he's got a CDC vaccination?
79,34,"Then you can wear a mask for hours at work without anyone knowing, and you can't help getting into a fight against a disease that's going to kill you if it isn't in the same state as a vaccine."
79,35,I don't understand why you're being so anti-masking. A good anti-masker will suck at this but in the end it's not what s Santa needs. A mask isn't an ebola killer. He's an anti-masker and he doesn't seem to know what to do.
79,38,"That's an overly over-reacting, disgusting, and disgusting post. It was a great example of how disgraceful people are, and how many other people I have never met that did this kind of thing, and just the way it's treated is a bit of a fucking shit."
79,39,"You want me to wear a mask? A simple mask will take you away from the situation, and you can't get back to work after all the time spent wearing a mask. What is it you want me to do now? Wear a mask."
79,40,The problem is that the people who haven't even made a mask at Christmas aren't going to take any responsibility for their own health.
79,43,"And that's why you have a mask on... and no, you don't need one."
79,46,It sounds like you don't have a problem. They're just a bunch of dicks.

98,79,"> Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
100,79,i wear a mask and wear a mask now if you want a better feeling.
101,79,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
79,9,I can't think of a better time to tell someone about a man wearing a mask.
79,34,It's a shameful situation. And he's got a reason.
79,35,This seems like a pretty fucking good reason to wear a mask.
79,38,"> This is a great example of how disgraceful people are, and how many other people I have never met that did this kind of thing, and just the way it's treated is a bit of a fucking shit."

79,40,"What's this? This isn't how it works. It's a way for people to know better, but if you want to avoid having to wear a mask, go buy some new ones."
79,43,The only one I care about is Santa. It's a terrible and dishonest act that is not doing anything to stop the disease from spreading. It's a bad actor that is refusing to help in a way that is a little different.
79,46,I think what this guy did in that movie is kind of a shame because the movie explains that a CDC vaccine and mask prevent a lot of people from doing it.
79,62,Why is Santa in a mask with no vaccine?
79,69,"He doesn't like wearing a mask at Christmas, because he's an anti-masker. He doesn't like wearing a mask when it's hot and you can't wear one because you're wearing one."
79,72,"In the movie, you had to say ""A little bit about your comment but then I remembered the link: We were talking about a man who is a bad actor."""
88,79,"I think there is no such thing as ""good enough"" or ""perfect"" for all of us."
94,79,"I believe that he's trying to do some bad stuff.

79,62,He's being a terrible man. He is in a mask with no vaccine.
