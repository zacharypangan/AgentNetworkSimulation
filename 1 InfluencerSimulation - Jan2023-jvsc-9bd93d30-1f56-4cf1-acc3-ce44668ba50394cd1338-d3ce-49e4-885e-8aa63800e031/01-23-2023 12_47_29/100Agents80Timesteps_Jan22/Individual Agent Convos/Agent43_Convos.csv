43,24,I don't think it's possible to get vaccinated from the covid epidemic. The problem with a mask is that it's hard to get it out without one. The reason is because they're such a bad idea to treat so many people who have this.

43,39,I've been vaccinated before.

43,29,I think a doctor's job is to protect the patients. Having a mask doesn't mean they don't care about being vaccinated and to prevent the spread of the virus. So if you don't see a doctor who is the doctor then you don't care about being a doctor. It means you are in the right.
