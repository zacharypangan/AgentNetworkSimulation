96,89,wrong again brainiac among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
89,1,What does it mean that the number of people who do not wear masks isn't actually that low? I would say that is the most reprehensible reason and it's not something to be afraid of.
89,19,How did you feel when you said its shocking that in this country there are still people who dont wear a mask in public who dont care about others health and people who dont even believe this pandemic exists shocking
89,33,"oh, i see the scars on your face and I don't really care about the pandemic, but i think that's really unfortunate because i care so much about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask."
89,36,It's not shocking at all because it's a very serious pandemic.

96,89,Is there anything you have to wear to be safe?
89,1,CANNOTANSWER FUCK UP IM JUST A COUNT!
89,19,How about the scars on your face and I can't breathe without a mask?
89,33,"That's not a good explanation, but isn't this not what people wear at work?"
89,36,i read the article. it's a serious pandemic.
89,55,"oh, I see the scars on your face and I don't really care about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask. It's really unfortunate because i care so much about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask."
89,56,"So what I mean is that we have a health care system and people still need to wear a mask every day because a lot of medical workers do not get it, that's not surprising at all."
89,57,"I don't wear a mask as much, if at all. I don't wear a mask when I go out in public. I wear my mask when I get to the bathroom and can't be in front of people. I wear my mask when I'm busy with a job, but in public, I don't even wear it because people are afraid of the strangers who are stepping on me."
89,58,>Isn't it a huge deal that people still do not wear masks in public?
89,66,You are doing something like this. What is the biggest thing about it?
89,68,"This pandemic is a big deal. You do not wear a mask, you don't wear a mask."
96,89,That's all I've heard.
89,1,I'd say it's shocking because the numbers are so low that it's almost impossible to have a mask when people are afraid of the people in front of them.
89,19,"OP is a real life scumbag and I don't think he is crazy or naive. The way you express yourself in public is to say, ""I don't really care about the pandemic. I see the scars on your face and I don't really care about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask. It's really unfortunate because i care so much about the health of my patients that i could really barely breathe without a mask. Isn't it a huge deal that people still do"

89,55,"If you do not wear a mask, you do not have to wear a mask."
89,56,"People can wear a mask when they're stressed. It's a part of our job, not a piece of equipment."
89,57,"People don't care about the pandemic. The pandemic is a massive, escalating threat to their health. People who do, on the other hand, care about other people's health, can't get it or it's a pandemic that's not quite a pandemic."
89,58,"OP, I'm a very big fan of people wearing masks. It's just not as common as other people who wear them. I've never really been as good at it as I have been about people wearing them."
89,66,I don't think this is an 'issue' but I guess you can't be really sure. Is there anything you have to wear to be safe? CANNOTANSWER FUCK UP IM JUST A COUNT! How about the scars on your face and I can't breathe without a mask?
89,68,I have one of these. It is a mask and I don't wear it in public.
96,89,"Is it okay to have the system in the first place. I'm sorry, I can't be sure. I'm sorry, I can't be sure. I'd rather I had my mask on, not my medical meds. I'm a patient.

89,1,"I don't know who I would call a scumbag here, I don't think it's funny that I've seen it done to some other people, but I'm not sure it's in the right context."
89,19,"If you wear a mask in public to work, you don't have to wear it. And you can be the one in the hospital."
89,33,I had my mask on while at work because I had no time to get dressed and felt bad about it. But it made me laugh at it and I feel very embarrassed that I was wearing a mask and felt like a total asshole.

89,57,>Isn't it a huge deal that people still do not wear masks in public?
89,58,"The pandemic has already swept through the country. If people don't wear masks in public, they're out of luck."
89,66,"Unless someone likes to say that they're wearing a mask, they should be ashamed that it's a pandemic."
89,68,This is why I don't wear them at work.
96,89,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
89,1,This is why I don't wear them at work.

89,33,Is your doctor a doctor or a patient?
89,36,So I've been wearing my mask to work and I have to wear a mask at work?
89,55,"OP, I'm a very big fan of people wearing masks. It's just not as common as other people who wear them. I've never really been as good at it as I have been about people wearing them. I don't think it's funny that I've seen it done to some other people, but I guess you can't be really sure. Is there anything you have to wear to be safe?"
89,56,...but I'm a doctor. I'm really tired of a mask.
89,57,"The pandemic has already swept through the country. If people don't wear a mask in public, they're out of luck."
89,58,That's a good question. What are the problems with the system that allow people to wear a mask at work?
89,66,I have a doctor at work who would recommend me to wear a mask.
89,68,">But it made me laugh at it and I feel very embarrassed that I was wearing a mask and felt like a total asshole. You're not a patient, you're a patient."
96,89,"""I'm sorry, I can't be sure. I'd rather I had my mask on, not my medical meds."""
89,1,What's this pandemic saying about the medical system? What's yours?
89,19,"I don't understand why people don't wear masks at work? It's just that people don't like being on the street because it's a joke. That's my point. If there's a pandemic, how is it acceptable for them to wear masks."
89,33,"You should look into getting a mask so that you can breathe without it. And you know, to keep it under control."
89,36,"I have a mask on that is not a pandemic, but is a doctor who will recommend me to wear it to work. I want to say that my opinion is not as broad or valid as some of the others, because I've heard it be used as an excuse for this pandemic."
89,55,"""...but I'm a doctor. I'm really tired of a mask."""
89,56,"I'm really tired of a mask. But I'm ashamed. It's not a way for me to work, I'm ashamed of it. I feel really bad for not wearing a mask :("
89,57,How do you feel about people who do not wear masks at work if they do not want to be able to get a mask?
89,58,I would ask yourself whether it is okay to have the system in the first place.
89,66,I don't think it is an 'issue' but I guess you can't be really sure. Isn't it a huge deal that people still do not wear a mask in public?
89,68,This is why I don't wear them at work.
96,89,"Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the virus. You can wear it at any time of the day to keep yourself safe, but I find it useless."
89,1,"People don't wear masks, because of people who have no knowledge of them."
89,19,Is your doctor a doctor or a patient?
89,33,"It's a bad thing to wear a mask at work. But if you're a doctor, it's really important to have an appropriate mask that prevents them from coming in contact with other people."
89,36,"If you're wearing a mask at work, a doctor is probably going to prescribe you a mask, and you have to wear it to a job, even if it's just to keep you safe."
89,55,"You do not have to wear a mask at work, do you?"
89,56,It is a joke that you said.
89,57,"I think it's interesting that you think the AIDS pandemics are about a lack of awareness about how sick people are, and to put it simply, that many people don't wear masks, and that a lot of people do not care about their health."
89,58,"I see no problem with people wearing a mask in public if there's a pandemic, and I can't do that because people don't want to risk their life and their health, so I don't wear it."
89,66,What’s the biggest thing about it?
89,68,"I am afraid that this pandemic is a large pity and therefore you should be ashamed. I think that because the masks have not gone off, it will come back."
96,89,What a waste of money. It's really not a waste of money. What is the purpose of having them in the first place?
89,1,"I'm a medical practitioner and have never worn a mask at work, nor am I aware that it's necessary."
89,19,Is your doctor a doctor or a patient?
89,33,"There is no such thing as a “shocking” pandemic. The problem is the lack of people being able to be in public and having someone come and take them, because their body and mind are not in a state of constant need for treatment."
89,36,I've been a doctor and I don't wear a mask. I don't know why.
89,55,"As far as I know, this is all about the lack of awareness. I'm not saying it's a joke, but I'm saying the lack of awareness is important."
89,56,"I'm a doctor, and I wear a mask in public. I wear it at the office. If it is something I'm worried about, I don't wear it. I wear it when I'm stressed. It's part of my job, not a piece of equipment."
89,57,I don't think it's as if people are ignoring the pandemic and the stigma of having one. It's only a problem that a lot of people are doing in order to prevent it from happening again.
89,58,"Is a mask on okay? Because I'm in the AIDS pandemic, and people have no idea what a pandemic is."
89,66,"Yes, I think it is a shame that so many people who don't wear masks in public do not get them."
89,68,I don't like how the people who wear masks and the people who don't want them in the first place talk about how they feel. I think they're just bringing the pandemic up.
96,89,I'm sick of sick people. This is why I am sick of people with HIV. It's so bad and I can't live without it.
89,1,What do you do when you have an AIDS pandemic?
89,19,"Is it a joke? Or is it something you would just say, ""Is it a joke? That's my point. If there's a pandemic, how is it acceptable for people to wear masks."""
89,33,"I have a friend that is with me, and he always asks me for suggestions."
89,36,What is your job? Are you working to improve your life?
89,55,I don't want to know this.
89,56,I have a scarecrow on my hand when I'm wearing a mask.
89,57,"AIDS pandemics are not only a global phenomenon, but also global. People who have AIDS have a very clear vision of the health and well being of those who are sick. The pandemic in AIDS pandemics are not a global pandemic."
89,58,"There are very few pandemics in a country, especially in the UK."
89,66,"What are you thinking? There's a good reason for people who don't wear masks, but I know some people who are."
89,68,I just gotta go on and on about it.
96,89,"I am sorry i'm a patient, but i think i'm going to be a bad patient with AIDS, especially if i haven't worn my masks before."
89,1,"The apologies of bringing it up, but I'm very happy you don't make it down in the wrong place."
89,19,"You are right if he doesn't have one. In the UK, the pandemic is much less common."
89,33,I've never been a doctor. I think it's a joke but not a joke.
89,36,"My friend is a doctor in the UK, so I've been doing this for a while. She says if someone does tell her they're worried about the pandemic and don't want to go see her doctor, she may want to wear a mask in order to keep her safe. I can't even imagine being able to talk to her about it."
89,55,If you don't wear a mask in public you may get a fever.
89,56,"Yes, I think it's a joke."
89,57,This is a big deal. There's not a pandemic in the UK. But there are people who can't get in the door.
89,58,"I don't wear a mask at all unless I am in an AIDS pandemic. I don't want the stigma to continue, even if I don't wear a mask."
89,66,"It's not a joke, but a joke. I don't understand how you could get into a lot of people's minds when they do something similar to 'What are you thinking?', 'What's the biggest thing about this? ', 'There's a good reason for people who don't wear masks, but I know some people who are."
89,68,"i am sorry i'm a patient, but i think i'm going to be a bad patient with AIDS, especially if i haven't worn my masks before."
96,89,"Well, a lot of people are being oversimplified by this. There is also a shortage of medical workers, as there are a few people who have been on the verge of getting AIDS. I wouldn't want to be at the hospital for this. There isn't a shortage, there isn't a shortage, there's a shortage of medics in the US."
89,1,"This isn't funny, that's funny. I think there is a stigma for this."
89,19,AIDS pandemics have spread worldwide in the past decade and we don't see it as a pandemic anymore. There are only two diseases which are still being affected.
89,33,">I have a friend that is with me, and he always asks me for suggestions. What is your job? Are you working to improve your life? I don't want to know this. I have a scarecrow on my hand when I'm wearing a mask."

89,55,Why do you say this? How did you feel about this?

89,56,"There is no pandemic in the UK, so if you don't wear a mask, you're not going to get in an infection pandemic."

89,1,I don't think it's funny because the scarecrow is an actual joke.
89,19,I feel like you're getting a little depressed and a bit upset because of how much your comment is bringing up the fact that you think there is still a shortage of medical workers.
