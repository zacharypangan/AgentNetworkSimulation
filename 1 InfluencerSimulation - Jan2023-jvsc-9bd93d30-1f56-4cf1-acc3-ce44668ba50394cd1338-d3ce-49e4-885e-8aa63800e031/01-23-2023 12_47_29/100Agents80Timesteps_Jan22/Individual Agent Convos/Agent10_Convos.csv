32,10,This sounds very very unhygienic. I know some people that are just being incredibly sarcastic.
33,10,IANAL. But wearing a mask in public. Wearing a mask in public is probably the best solution.
48,10,"Hi! I'm a nurse, and i'm a teacher. I was a nurse. We had a family that wanted to get vaccinated, but there wasn't enough medical work available. They rented out an office with the medical staff and had the medical staff put in extra training, and we all got sick and didn't have the medical equipment to go. I did get vaccinated and went to the dentist, and the dentist told me not to come, and he rented a car. We got to work and got vaccinated and we"

74,10,"OP, We are going to see a fight about the effect of a mask in the US on the players, but the question is if they should be able to wear a mask?"
81,10,"When I got vaccinated, a mask and a thigh-high headband a few days ago? That's what's making me want to wear a mask."
98,10,"They are the part of the virus that makes it unheard of to be considered a threat to the public. If they didn't try to make a difference in size, then you don't need to wear a mask. The problem is that they don't do this."

53,10,"You should wear a mask, so your mom is not in any danger of getting sick."
62,10,Why are you wearing a mask?
67,10,"CANNOTANSWER is an American citizen. He thinks the public health orders are quite valid. A sling or a mask, can still protect against flu. That is, if you do get it right, then that should be it."
69,10,I have a friend who is a paramedic that re-taintes his facial hair.
74,10,The question is: Why do you wear a mask? Is it because of the medical staff?
81,10,Is that what you wanted to wear?
98,10,"[NAME] says, ""Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. If you are going to fight with a man who is over ten thousand years old and has no strength, go with the hulk mask. How would that be acceptable to the virus?"

16,10,"I grew up in a place with more than 100 people with that sort of thing. I had an aunt who wore a mask for a few years. My mom did not want her to get the vaccinated because they were afraid to get her hands on her. She also didn't want to get the Covid vaccine because of what she had done, and that she just wanted to be protected. I'm not going to change my mind, but I want to see this issue, and it will make me uncomfortable if it doesn't have to be."

30,10,This is the first time I have heard this one:
32,10,The family member who gets sick by wearing the mask is a moron. He should go to a local hospital to get vaccinated.
33,10,"Is that the right answer? They would probably be better at keeping their masks on, and protecting themselves from the virus? When did you get vaccinated?"
48,10,I want to ask my dad. His father wants to know. He would like to know this and tell me.
53,10,"IANAL, OP: I can't understand how you could sass on a mask and bend over it? IANAL, OP: I am not an attorney for medical personnel and they can use that excuse to boot up and be responsible for disciplinary action against them Exactly!

13,10,What is the law on wearers that is enforced?
16,10,"That's probably a a bad idea. This would be an interesting, and probably sexist, idea, especially since it's not a medically valid issue. I think if you don't wear a mask and you don't get vaccinated for the virus, that is not a problem."
19,10,"CANNOTANSWER is telling his boss that wearing a mask on your face isn't an option, so he should wear it while working. It's more efficient than a mask in front of the manager if he can get sick. And they drew them from Georgia as a prequel in the Bible."

I was afraid that my dick would start bleeding out of it, I knew I had facial cancer and I tried to go to the gym.

16,10,I've been wearing a mask for years that I don't like because they hide a body part. OP has a very different sense of humor.
19,10,I'm just asking a question.
30,10,"I'm not sure what your reaction to the quote means, but if I was the guy who was going to put on a mask I would be ecstatic."
32,10,What does it say? The government is trying to force it on people. The government is trying to force it on them.
33,10,How did you get vaccinated?
48,10,"I think that if the CDC were to repeal the mandate, the CDC would be making it up."
53,10,What is your name? No.
62,10,>Why is it so fucking cold outside? How many times have you heard the virus in your mouth? I don't know why you have to wear a mask when it is in your system? It's really the same way you describe a group of people. And how they feel?
67,10,CANNOTANSWER is an advocate for a ban on vaccinating. This is a bad idea because you have to vaccinate someone.
69,10,The article is dissenting because the article is on the topic of how people use a mask and that is the real issue.
74,10,"CANNOTANSWER is an example of what the [National Patient Safety and Health Authority](http://www.npda.org/) has to offer for people who have an emergency to wear a mask, with some exception. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

16,10,I've seen this happen before.
19,10,Why do you think the government is infringing on rights to the US?
30,10,"A good candidate for president is a man who possesses a ""semen"" to give out a swish of his body to a sick, sick person on the planet. It's going to be interesting, but the man doesn't have to wear a mask to make a deal, and it's not going to happen. He's a man who's got a swish of his own. Hence why he has a mask."
32,10,The word is a part of your conversation with the government that has been used a lot to get me through this thread. It's not like the whole thing is an argument to be made here.
33,10,I can't really say that a vaccination mandate is a joke. I don't think they're the answer.
48,10,"""When someone is getting sick it's not the best time to take a mask off. I'm going to ask my dad if he's going to get sick if it's too hot outside."""

62,10,Vaccines should be banned on the CDC's pandemic list. It's a great idea if the CDC can find out what the ddoxmm vaccine is.
67,10,How many people have a vaccination mandate for a pig?
69,10,How is the article dissenting?
74,10,IANAL is an example of what the National Patient Safety and Health Authority (NPHHA) has to offer for people who have an emergency to wear a mask.
81,10,"The first part of this is so annoying and insensitive that people say ""Okay, if you like wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please please"
98,10,As an Australian. I don't understand how someone can be too young to be wearing masks or be over-size in terms of appearance and appearance. It's very easy for an A-level bodybuilder to wear a mask if a slender person is over-sized.
13,10,I just can't find any other reasons why I wear a mask when I'm sick.
16,10,"I just wrote the same comment as you. I was joking, but I am a very smart person and I am very sensitive to his views. I really admire his sense of humor, but it’s also very insensitive to how he responds to such a'shame'."

It's more efficient than a mask in front of the manager if he can get sick. Hey! Are you going to Georgia? Because you're not going to Georgia because you think the apocalypse of the mask is a very good joke to make, and you think a dick would not exist in Georgia. Clearly it's about the US government."
30,10,"I know this is a very valid point and I think I agree with it but I don't think the message is well received, and i've never heard it attributed to me."
32,10,>why would you wear a mask when you've never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer?
33,10,"I mean, what you're saying isn't really true. I know a doctor who is a doctor and he wants to be a doctor. He is probably not a doctor but he's probably not a good doctor. I see what you mean - it's not a joke but it's just a remark, if I think about it I'm not sure what that would be."
48,10,"The CDC has a report for what's considered the ""no mask"" issue. The CDC says there is no evidence. I mean, I don't have to get you a lot of answers. I'm a man of two words. I don't see any answer. I'm a man of two words."
53,10,"The AMA said she was a ""special advisor"" to the OCPS on this. The OP's reaction was not the best, because her advice was, ""The drollin. I hate the dick, and I don't even know how to put on a mask."" IANAL, OP:"

67,10,CANNOTANSWER thinks the new vaccine mandate should be repealed. How does the mayor like to keep a mask and not want to get caught?
69,10,"What a joke! ""It's ridiculous"" is a lie."
74,10,I'd love to see a doctor's assistant that could explain this to him.

98,10,I read the headline and I was so angry at him for not wanting to get any kind of facial mask that I'd put up with getting one on the street.

33,10,">Cannotanyer is an anti-masked guy who is also a doctor. There is no such thing as a “shocking” pandemic. The problem is the lack of people being able to be in public and having someone come and take them, because their body and mind are not in a state of constant need for treatment.

48,10,This is a weird question.
53,10,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
62,10,I am not really a scientist. I just figured that if we ban Vaccines on the CDC's pandemic list we would have no problem with the fact that they're going to be anti-masked.

33,10,So what you did here is absolutely a ridiculous statement. The CDC wants to ban the ACA. I think that the government needs to stop wearing masks for medical purposes so they can not ban n masks.
