98,90,due to an obvious difference in size as in body size anti masker reluctantly adjusted his mask responsible citizen is over feet tall big the type of person you don t want to fight unless you absolutely have to
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,How much time have you wasted taking your mask off?
90,17,They are anti maskers and they get them to work and rework their masks in order to stop the virus.
90,23,The people who are completely anti mask i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once
90,25,IANAL but you said i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once?
90,28,"I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised"
90,29,How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?
90,31,I'm getting your back but I'll take you to a zoo to see what's going on.
90,35,what is the name of the company who invented the snoop dog in school?
90,38,What can I do for you and why?
90,45,Do you think we should stop dressing as the anti-mawer?
90,46,Are you in school now?
90,49,"You were in elementary school. You did not leave your mask off, or do you have the ability to use it?"
90,54,There are people who are completely anti mask.
90,55,People who have been a part of my life are a dick. It's just that you don't need to know them because they're a bit weird.
90,60,"The people who are completely anti mask are the people who are essentially antimasked. They will say ""she has no idea what to do with it"" if she actually wants to do it, which they aren't doing."
90,62,the people who are completely anti mask i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once
90,64,i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once the people who are completely anti mask i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once the people who are completely anti mask
90,66,"It sounds like a lot of the people in the video are not talking about the anti-masked kind of person who says, ""The people who are completely anti mask i assume just repeated grades in elementary school more than once"""
90,82,what is this? my ol' mask and the question i was putting up when I was younger. i never liked having a mask when i was young. i always figured it was for a reason.
90,86,This is why I never wear my mask to school. You are not a good teacher.
90,88,You are a really nice person. You are always being nice.
91,90,"if it s not the same woman, why do you not have a woman in your life?"
98,90,"a man of ten thousand years, he does not want to fight unless he can fit under him for a while. a man of eight thousand years is not a man."
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,"I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it? I'm getting your back but I'll take you to a zoo to see what's going on."
90,17,It's probably a bit odd that there's a lot of people who genuinely think a person can be antimasked without wearing it in school.
90,23,"i don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it? I'll take you to a zoo to see what's going on."
90,25,"I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?

Do you think we should stop dressing as the anti-mawer? Are you in school now?"
90,28,What do you think about all the people who wear masks?
90,29,"You say ""I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"""
90,31,"This sounds like a lot of the people in the video are not talking about the anti-masked kind of person who says, ""The people who are completely anti mask are the people who are essentially antimasked. They will say ""she has no idea what to do with it"" if she actually wants to do it, which they aren't doing."
90,35,You mucking around with the snoop dog?
90,38,"The people who are completely anti-masked don't like to wear masks to school, but they do want to wear them to school. It doesn't make sense to wear them to school."
90,45,"I'm going to pretend that I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"
90,46,That's an interesting question to ask. You think we should stop dressing as the anti-mawer? Are you in school now?
90,49,"i think that's a really weird question, as someone who has never even been in school."
90,54,The first video of the snoop dog has a title that says: You are a bit weird.
90,55,"No. I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it? I'll take you to a zoo to see what's going on."

90,62,"I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"
90,64,How are you being treated in school?
90,66,"I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"
90,82,I'm not a great teacher.
90,86,"I have a mask, and I like it. It makes me feel like a jerk."
90,88,"It's sad to hear how people feel that the masks have been on in the past, causing fear and anxiety in a way that is causing fear and anxiety in people."
91,90,The woman is the one who says i like my food. The person who says i like her food is a guy.
98,90,Is it really possible to have a fight with a mask that doesn't require you to wear one? What if you're in a hurry and have a bunch of people around?
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,"I'm just going to pretend that I don't know you, but I feel my mask is useless and ill advised."
90,17,I don't like to dress as the antimawer. I wear them to school.
90,23,"I'm sorry, i don't know you, but i feel you're going to have to go through a lot of problems just because you don't like them."
90,25,"'What do you think about all the people who wear masks? You say ""I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"""
90,28,"When I'm in school, I wear the mask because I feel like it will do the job."
90,29,What are you going to do with the mask?
90,31,I'm afraid there's not any way that people in the video have said anything.
90,35,So why don't you try to talk to a teacher and tell them that people are essentially wearing a mask to fight an anti-masked person?
90,38,This is a question that should be asked.
90,45,When did you last come to school?
90,46,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a great teacher. I have a mask, and I like it. It makes me feel like a jerk."
90,49,"CANNOTANSWER'S NOTE: The first video of the snoop dog has a title that says: You are a bit weird. No. I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"
90,54,I am not sure what you mean.
90,55,I have a mask that I just wear and I'm terrified of what a scary person they are. I get terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person. It feels silly and unnatural to wear that.
90,60,"The snoop dog is a bit weird, so he's been a while since I've been to school."
90,62,"What do you think about all the people who wear masks? You say ""I don't know you, I feel your mask is useless and ill advised How long have you been wearing the mask and how often do you think people are going to change it?"""

90,66,That snoop dog is a funny dick
90,82,CANNOTANSWER
90,86,I just wanna say it:
90,88,"i think it's interesting how people talk about wearing masks but don't say a lot about the anti-masked people. it sounds like some people in the video aren't talking about the anti-masked kind of person who says, ""The people who are completely anti-masked don't like to wear masks to school, but they do want to wear them to school."
91,90,CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU
98,90,I think it's because people who get tangled up in a mask often wear them.
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,CANNOTANSWER: I don't know you
90,17,Why are you going to wear masks in the first video?
90,23,CANNOTANSWER is a teacher and has a mask.
90,25,"I don't get the whole ""Why do people wear masks"" line.

90,31,"That's very interesting and makes sense, CANNOTANSWER."
90,35,"I think people who are anti-masked are more likely to wear them. If you like to wear a mask, you want to wear it to school? I think it's because people who get tangled up in a mask often wear them."

91,90,You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it!
98,90,I've also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask. It's basically just a mask that lets you see what you're getting into. It's a good way to prevent any bodily activity from happening.
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,Cannotanyer doesn't know him.
90,17,"""Cannotanyer is not a great teacher. I have a mask, and I like it. It makes me feel like a jerk. I get terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person."""
90,23,"[CANNOTANSWER] ([http://www.nbc.org/videos/nbc-tbs-dtccs-tbs-dtcsc/pdf/cannotanyer-fma-masked-fa-sno-seq.pdf) is not a great teacher. I have a mask, and I like it. It makes me feel like a jerk. I get terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person."
90,25,So he said he's not going to be a great teacher when he's in school?
90,28,"I'm a teacher. I've also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask. It's basically just a mask that lets you see what you're getting into. It's a good way to prevent any bodily activity from happening. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,29,CANNOTANSWER tells the teacher what they are going to do with the mask to fight. CANNOTANSWER also wants to learn how to not wear a mask if they don't know she has to wear a mask.
90,31,What are the rules for wearing a mask?
90,35,That's something that many teachers want to hear.
90,38,What is the word for 'who' and 'what do you do with the mask'?
90,45,"[In my opinion, wearing a mask isn't something that's a sexy way of disguise.](http://www.opinion.org/ref/2014/12/21/index.html)"
90,46,CANNOTANSWER is not a great teacher
90,49,"In addition to the article, CANNOTANSWER tells a teacher how anti-masked people are despite not like to wear them and why they wear them."
90,54,"[The first video of the snoop dog has a title that says: You are a bit weird.', 'There are people who are completely anti mask.', 'There are people who are completely anti mask.', 'There are people who are completely anti mask.', 'I am not sure what you mean.'"
90,55,CANNOTANSWER suggests that it's a good idea to wear a mask because it's attractive and it's a good way to prevent bodily activity from happening.
90,60,Cannotanyer is not a great teacher.
90,62,"So, what is the first sentence of the 'what about all the people who wear masks?' video?"
90,64,How is he being treated in school?
90,66,"Cannotanyer is not a great teacher. I have a mask, and I like it. I feel like a jerk. I get terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person. It feels silly and unnatural to wear that."

90,86,Are they afraid of other people wearing masks?
90,88,CANNOTANSWER says he will talk to the teacher of a snoop dog and ask if there's anything they can do.
91,90,"This guy sounds like an absolute idiot, and it's not even close to being a human being."
98,90,"I love masks, especially if you're a teenager, and the hulk mask is a little more feminine."
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,"It seems that the article is not accurate. Cannotanyer is saying, ""I'm not a great teacher, but I feel my mask is useless and ill advised."" Cannotanyer is not a good teacher. ""The first video of the snoop dog has a title that says: You are a bit weird.', 'There are people who are completely anti-masked.', 'There are people who are completely anti-masked.', ""There are people who are completely anti-masked.'"
90,17,"> I have a mask, and I like it. I feel like a jerk. I get terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person. It feels silly and unnatural to wear that."
90,23,"My opinion of a mask is that it's not that attractive and it prevents bodily activity from happening. If I was in the same position as yours, I would have had a problem with them, but then I would have to learn to prevent them from happening. (Cannotanzer) is a teacher and is also not a good teacher."
90,25,"CANNOTANSWER is a great teacher. In addition to the article, CANNOTANSWER tells a teacher how anti-masked people are despite not like to wear them and why they wear them."
90,28,It sounds like a very boring class. I can't even think of any sexy ways to get into a sexy class with my mask. I think that mask is really a little boring.
90,29,I have a hulk mask and I am terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person. It feels silly and unnatural.
90,31,Why is it that Cannotanyer tells a teacher? What if it's a mask? What are the rules for wearing a mask?
90,35,I like my masks and it makes me uncomfortable and uncomfortable in school.
90,38,CANNOTANSWER - the teacher who wants to stop wearing masks and who wants to learn to prevent bodily activity from happening.
90,45,CANNOTANSWER is a teacher.
90,46,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a great teacher
90,49,"CANNOTANSWER is a teacher, who also knows about how the mask is nice to wear, but also that he feels like a jerk for wearing it."
90,54,CANNOTANSWER is not a great teacher.
90,55,"I'm a teacher. I've also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask.

90,62,You have no idea what is going on here. You've just read the title.
90,64,i am a teacher and i like wearing a mask. i am not a great teacher. i am not good at it. i like wearing them
90,66,"CANNOTANSWER's a teacher, but his video makes it sound like the snoop dog is being used as a propaganda stunt."
90,82,The article talks about how some students are anti-masked and how they wear them and what they are doing.
90,86,Why aren't the people wearing masks an anti-masked person? Why is the teacher wearing them?
90,88,>Cannotanyer is not a great teacher
91,90,You don't want to know what he's talking about? You want to know why he is upset about a joke?
98,90,">I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that a person's body is more prone to sex than a mask. I think the best way to look nice is to use a mask, because it means something to them and looks more attractive."
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,"That's what the article says, and I don't even want to know what it is about."
90,17,It doesn't make sense for a teacher to have a mask at school. It does seem so insignificant. It's so very obvious why the teacher isn't a great teacher.
90,23,"""My opinion of a mask is that it's not that attractive and it prevents bodily activity from happening. If I was in the same position as you, I would have had a problem with them, but then I would have to learn to prevent them from happening."
90,25,What about people that don't like wearing masks because they are afraid of people?
90,28,"I think you're probably gonna have a very difficult time understanding what the mask is, because a woman in your class is likely to be wearing it in spite of their sexy masking sexiness. It's so a matter of how uncomfortable your class is that you might scream at them to be ""teething nice"". Then one person is going to start to hate the teacher."
90,29,The article makes it sound like the snoop dog is being used as a propaganda stunt.
90,31,Is that the guy that I met who wore a mask at school?
90,35,"CANNOTANSWER: CANNOTANSWER is not a great teacher. I've also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask. It's basically just a mask that lets you see what you're getting into. It's a good way to prevent any bodily activity from happening. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,38,Cannotanyer was not involved in the post.
90,45,"CANNOTANSWER has been very busy at his elementary school, where he's been in the office. His teacher is in charge of this class and they are not allowed to wear sexy masks. He's going to keep wearing the hulk masks because it's a sexy way of disguise. He's also going to make fun of some teachers for wearing the hulk mask."
90,46,"Cannotanyer is a teacher. He's not a great teacher, but he's a great teacher."
90,49,It sounds like a very boring class. I can't even think of any sexy ways to get into a sexy class with my mask. I think that mask is really a little boring. I have a hulk mask and I am terrified of people a lot more in school than they would a normal person. It feels silly and unnatural. Why is it that Cannotanyer tells a teacher? What if it's a mask? What are the rules for wearing a mask?
90,54,CANNOTANSWER and CANNOTANSWER are both teachers and a teacher themselves. CANNOTANSWER and CANNOTANSWER both know about what they're talking about and want to know what he's upset about.
90,55,"I'm in elementary school and have a mask that I wear, which is quite attractive, and makes me feel like I'm wearing a mask and I want to prevent the spread of the virus."
90,60,I'm a teacher. What's not a good teacher?
90,62,"I'm afraid this is the same story I'm watching. The other guy has the same thing going on, except he's getting angry at the person who wears the mask a lot. It is also saying that the way the person is dressed is not true and he's avoiding the people being anti-masked. He is being angry and says that it sounds like a very boring class."
90,64,So I'm a teacher. I like wearing masks to get into sexy classes.
90,66,Why did he use the snoop dog?
90,82,">Cannotanyer is a teacher, who also knows about how the mask is nice to wear, but also that he feels like a jerk for wearing it."
90,86,"I see your point, but I've found that if a person can't think of a sexy way to use a mask to prevent bodily activity from happening, then they are not able to wear a mask. So, it sounds like a boring class, isn't it?"
90,88,What I like about wearing a mask is that they think it's nice and makes you look nice. CANNOTANSWER wants to talk to a teacher about it and tell him that he's not a great teacher and that his students shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask because they don't want to look nice.
91,90,What kind of law do you believe the government has in place?
98,90,"I'm really curious if it would help. I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that that a person's body is more prone to sex than a mask. I think the best way to look nice is to use a mask, because it means something to them and looks more attractive."
101,90,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
90,16,The article doesn't say he's a teacher. He's not a great teacher and he's a great teacher. It says Cannotanyer is a teacher and he's not a good teacher.
