96,38,I've had to ask a doctor in the last week about a condition where wearing a mask is not a sign of a shortage of medical workers. Almost every doctor I've talked to said they were unwilling to accept a medical work order of this nature.
96,44,"My brother was diagnosed with HIV and was diagnosed a few weeks later. He is still in hospital, but my gp was not able to continue to talk to me. He didn't tell me about his HIV 'cure' until recently, he was in the hospital for a week before being diagnosed. I have since switched back to the US and that is how I was treated.
