85,3,"The only person who wants the covid vaccine to be legal is that it is a vaccine and has no other purpose other than that it's not a symptom. It's not just a mask and its not a mask, it's an anti-vaccination, which is a drug that protects you from it."
88,3,IANAL says the worst part of the job is working as a daycare worker and getting through to other workers.
94,3,"IANAL: 'The mask is like a dick, but with a nose', and it's more important than that ""Face is a dick, that has no nose."" aspect makes no sense. This isn't going to help. Unless you really need to have a mask, you could be seriously fucked."

74,3,"People have a lot of trouble with the notion of the ""discrimination"" of masks. Why did you want to marry a woman - it sounds like you just want to be married?"
76,3,The best part about this is the fact that it sounds like a shit joke. It reminds me of someone who would rather wear a mask in the first place.
