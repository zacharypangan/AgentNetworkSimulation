80,38,question what can be done when i walk into a place to pick up food amp not one employee is wearing a mask i m the only person in the place wearing one trust me i know it s uncomfortable to wear all day i don t love wearing it either but we re doing it to protect each other
81,80,please wear a mask amp bend over
82,80,wearing this mask and it being so hot
85,80,well saw my first person get booted out for not keeping their mask on
95,80,this is shaping up to be an unnecessarily stressful week but if the texassupremecourt holds up anti mask mandate we ll have to withdraw the kids again and homeschool again too many other school districts have already seen cases spike for us to take chances
96,80,wrong again brainiac among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
80,38,No Answer>. I think it's important that you wear a mask
81,80,"I think it's time for you to change the mask, then take the mask off and move on."
82,80,Tell me about it! Why do I have to wear mask? It is pretty uncomfortable.
85,80,"Well, is it that you think it's hard to get a job when you can't wear a mask on a night shift at work?"

80,38,"I believe it's important that you wear a mask, then take the mask off and move on. Tell me about it! Why do I have to wear mask? It is pretty uncomfortable."
81,80,I feel like the first thing I did was wear a mask. When I got vaccinated I decided to wear a mask and bend over and over.
82,80,I don't think there are some cases in which a person who doesn't like a mask will stop wearing it? That would be a very valid explanation for what I mean.
85,80,This is a really bad comment.

81,80,It's not a joke. The question is why are you wearing a mask?

96,80,I don't really want to wear a mask. My job is to protect me. And I don't want to work in a clinic with a doctor.
