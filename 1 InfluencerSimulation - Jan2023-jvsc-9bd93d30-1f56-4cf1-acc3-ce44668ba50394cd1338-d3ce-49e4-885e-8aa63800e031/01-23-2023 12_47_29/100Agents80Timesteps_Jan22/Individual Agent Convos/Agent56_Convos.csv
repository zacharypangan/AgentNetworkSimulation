71,56,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
81,56,please wear a mask amp bend over
88,56,i know it s for the best of all but wearing a mask for hours at work is so tiring and annoying props to those healthcare workers for doing it for such long periods of time
89,56,its shocking that in this country there are still people who dont wear a mask in public who dont care about others health and people who dont even believe this pandemic exists shocking

101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,14,What's wrong with the joker sneezing on without a mask and if he's in the US he's not getting the vaccine he doesn't need a mask?
56,33,"No, I am not. Do you like to sneeze on?"
56,35,"i would wear a mask in the event that he can t come, i would wear it because i feel like he can do it so fast"
56,43,"I'm so sorry about this. This post is all about the clowns in the video, the jokers, the sick and all."
56,44,This is why I wear a mask while working out. Honestly I don't think the mask mandate is being lifted and the vaccination options are still a few weeks out for most of us.
56,51,Honestly if I could do this without a mask that wouldn't have made any difference.
56,52,Why don't you just put a mask on?
61,56,"I don't like your style, but this is a really good question. You aren't making a joke, and you aren't making it."
71,56,i am a huge fan of the use of masks. i also like the idea of trying to make people ill and nauseous so i do not mind it.
81,56,Why is this not on the top post?
88,56,I hate to admit it. But masks and eye masks are the worst part of work!

56,44,If you can get the vaccine you do not need to wear a mask. You can also wear a face mask instead.

71,56,"Vaccinations can cause problems in your body, including the appearance of it. But there is a reason they're necessary for those kids in hospitals, and that's because that's one of the reasons they're so resistant to vaccinations.

56,44,"A friend of mine used to wear a mask at the doctor's office. She got the nasa vaccine and he wouldn't get to take it. He also got a flu vaccine, and after he got to the doctor, it was removed."
56,51,"I think it is a joke, but it's a joke. A prank. It sounds like the doctor has a good idea, and the title is misleading. It makes you think that he's being irrational."

56,33,It's a prank. A prank is a prank. It's a prank.
56,35,A doctor has a right to ban a doctor for making a joke about the medical shortage. The doctor can do something he wants without an unfit mother who has a typhoid. The doctor could make a joke about it.
56,43,"Are you talking about the fact that they don't do anything about this? It's kind of the same thing - that one's not a joke, but that one's not a joke. I don't think he is being funny or any joke at all, so he sounds like he's being a bit off putting and putting on a mask as a joke."

61,56,The answer is... the joke is really funny.
71,56,"The CDC is a problem, the problem isn't the CDC itself, it's the lack of time to do vaccines."
81,56,"If I were you, it would be better to be sure I'm not going to put in some kind of mask. Like you said, I like wearing a mask and I don't really like wearing it. I mean I mean, a lot of people don't get to like it. It's a prank. I don't think it's funny or the point of a joke is to get people to think they're a doctor.
