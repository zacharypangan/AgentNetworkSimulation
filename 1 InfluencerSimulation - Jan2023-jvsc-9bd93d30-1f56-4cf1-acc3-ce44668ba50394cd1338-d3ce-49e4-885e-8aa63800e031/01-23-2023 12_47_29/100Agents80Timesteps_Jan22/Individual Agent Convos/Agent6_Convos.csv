93,6,I think the other part of the sentence is too simple.

36,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,6,The article is an attempt to prevent the pandemic. It’s one of the most dangerous things that CANNOTANSWER has told the world.

76,6,CANNOTANSWER has a friend who is anti-masked.
81,6,"A doctor is not the same as a doctor. He’s saying there is a joke that makes him seem like he’s not doing it right. It’s more like ""please wear a mask and bend over please please wear a mask and bend over please please wear a mask and bend over please please wear a mask and bend over please please please please please please please please please please""."
85,6,"I think you're right. In the UK there are shortage of doctors and nurses who are working in a shortage of masks. You can't make an attempt at a restraining order. I think your question is insensitive, and the question is why would you want to keep a mask on?"

94,6,I have to do this: I'm a super hero and I don't want to have a movie where I wear a hat because I'm unable to see any other people. And I can't see how the costume fits in the way people think.

36,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,6,It's called being in a mask. CANNOTANSWER'S article was actually written by CANNOTANSWER and has not been translated into any other language. He was speaking in English.
49,6,It is a joke. You're getting your meds back and it just makes me happy. I just want to know why.

94,6,I think it's an extremely weird thing that people say that they're wrong and it isn't the correct answer.

I don't like wearing a mask when I'm not watching the movie.
97,6,That is exactly what cannotanswerer is saying.

62,6,>I'm a medical practitioner and have always hated wearing a mask despite the fact that I was a student and not a doctor.
66,6,I see your point here. There is a lot of sarcasm that goes on here. The question is why isn’t the CDC still covering the pandemic?
70,6,He's not an attorney. He's an attorney who was involved in a prank involving a hospital and was able to prove that he is.

49,6,"I don't get what it means to be in a joke, but I do agree that it is a joke that has been on the front page for a long time. The last part is that people are still wondering why they are ignoring some of the information presented. This is why you should think of yourself as an expert."
57,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

32,6,"Canna has been told that the CDC doesn't have the money to ban ACA vaccines in the future. I'm not a lawyer, and I don't have a legal opinion. The CDC is a problem, the problem isn't the CDC itself, it's the lack of time to do vaccines."
