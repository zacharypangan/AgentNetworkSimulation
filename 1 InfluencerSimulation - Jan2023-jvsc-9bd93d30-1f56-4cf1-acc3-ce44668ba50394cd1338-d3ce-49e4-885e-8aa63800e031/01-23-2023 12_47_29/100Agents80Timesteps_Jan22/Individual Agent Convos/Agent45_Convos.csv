94,45,He doesn't wear a mask for his job - that's not what it is. It's a mask for his job - it's for being a doctor that is trying to convince a woman that he has a bad job. But he's not an actor.
96,45,The BBC shows a problem. They have two articles.

96,45,This is the third time in a year that an expert on HIV/AIDS has made a critical reference to the NHS stating that the NHS doesn't have enough medical workers to treat HIV/AIDS patients.
46,45,CANNOTANSWER was a doctor.
57,45,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

46,45,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked teacher.
57,45,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,45,"The problem is that it doesn't get enough medical equipment to prevent the spread of the disease, which is a very rare case, and that's why it's not recommended for the public health."

59,45,"The article states the issue is preventing people from euthanizing themselves. The narcissistic side of the issue isn't that there's no shortage of medical equipment to prevent ebola. There is a lot of problems that the US government can't solve. I'm not sure what the issue is, but it is one of the most irrational and sexist things I've ever heard. 'If you are being booted by the government because you're not a doctor, you aren't even a doctor"
86,45,"""The NHS has a shortage of medics. The NHS has a shortage of medics. The NHS has a shortage of doctors and nurses."""
90,45,Cannotanyer and Kannonsky are not anti-masking teachers.
94,45,>Is Santa a bad actor or a doctor?
96,45,Is there a shortage of medical workers?
46,45,"CANNOTANSWER, Is the coronavirus actually an actual virus? The hat problem. There is a lot more to the message. CANNOTANSWER, Is the coronavirus actually an actual virus? The hat problem. There is a lot more to the message."

90,45,"Cannotanyer, Kannonsky, and Kannonsky have been talking in an AMA titled ""Cannotanyer, Kannonsky, Kannonsky, Kannonsky, Kannonsky."" I am going to give a hat to a man who is wearing a hat but he can't look at it."
94,45,I think that they would be a bit more understanding of Santa in other areas. It seems that they aren't exactly on the same page here. It's more like the actor trying to be a bad actor.
96,45,There is a shortage of medical workers in the UK because of shortage of medical workers.
46,45,The hat problem isn't a joke. It's a way to get the CDC to keep them on all the time.

90,45,The anti-masked theory teaches sex and is a good idea.
94,45,I thought OP's comment was a tad confusing. I don't think it's as funny as the article suggested.
96,45,"[CanNOTANSWER] is an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS, and has seen multiple times. The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS is failing because it hasn't staffed properly. Isn't wearing a mask a sign of a shortage of medical workers?"

86,45,The joke doesn't make any sense. It's misleading. It doesn't make sense.
90,45,So is the hat. The hat makes the school uncomfortable. The mask does not make sex more attractive. And can't prevent a person from having sex. It makes them uncomfortable.
94,45,IANAL'S THEATER!
96,45,I am interested in the answers of these two questions.
46,45,"The question is if the student that they're taking to the school wants to get vaccinated? Probably not, but they’re putting the teachers in a different situation."

86,45,IANAL is a very well known and respected doctor who believes that wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus.
90,45,I am interested in the title of this article.
94,45,">""I think that he’s trying to be something that he grew up doing."""
96,45,The lack of medical workers and the inability of doctors and nurses to treat HIV/AIDS patients is a serious health problem. The NHS needs to focus on the current problems.
46,45,A snoop joke is just another joke if you ask me.
57,45,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,45,IANAL is a very witty and inappropriate response.

86,45,You can't force a person to wear a mask because a child has a sex problem?
90,45,CANNOTANSWER is a great teacher. But Kannonsky is not a great teacher.
94,45,It sounds like the author of the book has a lot of personal issues and is trying to bring it to the forefront. I don't understand why.
96,45,I have no understanding of HIV/AIDS.
46,45,"I'm going to go ahead and say you're a bad teacher for being a good teacher, but that's not what the OP meant."

90,45,Cannotanyer is anti-masked because he thinks it's a sexy way of disguise. He also believes that the school can help prevent the virus so he can make fun of the teacher for wearing the hat. Kannonsky is an anti-masked schoolteacher. He has been a great teacher.
94,45,"CANNOTANSWER OP: I think that he is trying to be a hero. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn't make sense. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn't make sense.
