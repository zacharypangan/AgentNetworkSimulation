72,5,This is a valid reason to wear a mask. Wearing a mask at work is uncomfortable.
72,11,A covid mask is a great idea for healthcare. It's a mask that's shaped with the eye of a covid and the eye of the worker as a mask for the person doing the work.

It was so painful to not have a mask on, it was insecure and uncomfortable. But there is a lot of other people, including my son. You can't seem to care"

72,63,I think the answer is to say you're really into healthcare. I hate when people wear a mask to get sick - and that is when they actually want to get sick. It is not to stop it from getting better because it's not going to help you work.
