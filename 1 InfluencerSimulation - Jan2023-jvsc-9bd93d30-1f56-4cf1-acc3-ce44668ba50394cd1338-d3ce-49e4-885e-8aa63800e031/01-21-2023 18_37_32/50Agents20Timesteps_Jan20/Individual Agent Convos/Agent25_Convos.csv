26,25,passes are solddd outtt but you can still pay at the door mask required

46,25,this man just lowered his mask to cough
1,25,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
25,28,What is the worst part of that?
26,25,if you flagrantly disregard public health guidance and refuse to wear a mask you shouldn t be allowed treatment at all let alone top tier treatment the rest of america can t access if you flagrantly disregard public health guidance and refuse to wear a mask you shouldn t be allowed treatment at all let alone top tier treatment the rest of america can t access
30,25,Tell me about your vote for Romney.
46,25,IANAL - but i read that and i think it was the person who was hysterical with it?
1,25,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
25,28,What is this man wearing a mask in while vaccinated?
26,25,"Well, we should be using the first two digits of the vaccinated code to elicit this response."
30,25,"Well, if you really don't want a vaccinated person, i think you should. Obviously you don't like to go to the doctor. And if you don't, then you should not be allowed to have them. What if you don't get the vaccine yourself? Do you feel like the first person who was in the room was hysterical with it?"
46,25,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
1,25,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
25,28,"I think the best thing you can do is to try to pull out some face masks before you go, because they're just a big part of life."
26,25,"I'm against the new mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
30,25,"I think the 'hysterical' person is just using a slur to create a 'puppet' reaction, so maybe he's right."
46,25,"When my parents made me have a mask, I was a bit uncomfortable with it and wore it all the time. I couldn't breathe with it on, but I can't breathe with it on."
1,25,>Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
25,28,CANNOTANSWER: The narrator is not a doctor. He is a president.
26,25,The narrator is not a doctor. He is a president.
30,25,"""I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."""
46,25,Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
1,25,"There's a real problem with being a face mask, that is why you're wearing it, in the first place. It's the best thing you can do."

26,25,You're right that there are not people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal. I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. I think the government should not be involved in this ordeal.

46,25,"There are very few issues that warrant a conversation like this. People don't make it a priority to talk about it. I think the conversation is all about what's going on. There is no need for ""how the government is doing that"" in the US and we don't have a common ground on that."
1,25,I am a little concerned because of my age.
25,28,"CANNOTANSWER: In my opinion, he should have told me that the government should do more to stop the pandemic than to stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated."
26,25,CANNOTANSWER:
30,25,CANNOTANSWER:
46,25,If they were going to ban children from wearing masks when they were already vaccinated then that would be a bad idea. Then why would they want to ban kids?
1,25,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
25,28,"CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them. That's how the government treats kids, that's why CANNOTANSWER's dad was in a public school."
26,25,What was his father's answer to what CANNOTANSWER was claiming to be a lawyer?
30,25,"The narrator is not a doctor. He is a president. The government can't stop a virus from affecting people, that's a serious matter. It's not the government's job to stop the narrator, it's the agency to tell the president of the issue."","
46,25,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, is very edgy. In the middle of a pandemic. I feel terrible for my parents. CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER. CANNOTANSWER. CANNOTANSWER:"
1,25,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
25,28,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER."
26,25,What is the number of people that would feel uncomfortable wearing masks?
30,25,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a huge fan of the ""I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved."""
46,25,"Why does a face mask cause pandemics? The fact that you were given a mask to make a joke is a sign that your parents are going to have a lot of problems with your skin and eyes, and that you are afraid that you will be infected."
1,25,How much are he paid?
25,28,"In the CDC study a child volunteered to go to the bathroom in the middle of a pandemic while he wore a mask and went with his friends. There is a big difference between a pandemic and being vaccinated. The CDC and the CDC aren't even on the same page about how doctors can tell people how to prevent a pandemic if they don't wear a mask, just that it's dangerous for the people to be exposed to the disease."
26,25,"CANNOTANSWER is the one who is a little concerned that his parents will have a lot of problems with his skin and eyes, and that he is afraid that he will be infected. I think it's a good idea for them."
30,25,"Then you need to explain that it's not ""the best thing to do for your health, so you can protect yourself."""
46,25,I don't think they're a red flag.
1,25,CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice.
25,28,That's why they are so critical of the US government.

30,25,I don't know what the actual problem is. What I do know is that the government has the power to prevent pandemics and the government does not. It doesn't work against people who are vaccinated against the virus. It works against people who are vaccinated against the virus.
46,25,"Because this is a very common misconception, it's not something that is actually true."
1,25,It's the government's responsibility to tell people the dangers of the pandemic.
25,28,It's an interesting question. What does a mask and a mask have to do with a person who is a teen? What is his father's mask?
26,25,In this case I was going to ask if that was a common misconception among the general population.
30,25,"I guess it's a privilege. I don't see any morally incorrect or equivocal explanations or questions for what the new law is about. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here. I've always thought that being a teen like that causes the rash of pandemics? “This is just a big red flag. What does a mask and a mask have to do with a person who is a teen? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it’s useless and I hate it"
46,25,Why did he never wear a mask when he was younger?
1,25,How is it a joke that someone isn't on the same page?
25,28,What do you mean by 'two years ago when a teen in the US was banned from wearing a mask? '
26,25,I'm curious: Why does the president never wear a mask?
30,25,This seems like a really good question.
46,25,The only thing that would stop the pandemic is if it spreads through the nation. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.
1,25,"This isn't even the first time you've heard this quote. I guess you're right it's a big red flag."" I don't think he's a dick at all."

26,25,"I know there is a lot of confusion here, but I have no idea what you're getting at here."
30,25,I haven't seen a CANNOTANSWER episode yet. Why is this the top of the CANNOTANSWER page?
46,25,Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page? Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page? Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page? Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page?

25,28,"CANNOTANSWER is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars,"
26,25,CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie.
30,25,What is the most important point in the discussion?
46,25,"Cannotanywer has a lot of facts to share with us that he might have a serious misunderstanding of this quote. He can't tell anyone and his side is completely biased, and is simply just trying to say that, in order to be honest, he needs to have a face mask."

26,25,"CANNOTANSWER: I am a doctor, is a politician, not a lawyer."
30,25,"Yes, I am a lawyer. I was merely responding to one of the comments: ""Cannotanywer has a lot of facts to share with us that he might have a serious misunderstanding of this quote."
46,25,"The point of this isn't the 'I like wearing a mask' thing; it's the fact that it is uncomfortable for people with the illness, which isn't about the mask itself. It's about how people make a decision, and not how things should be perceived in the general public. 'Cannotanywer's quote is called ""... CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.""', 'We all have our reasons!', 'I'm also a very conservative,"
1,25,So a lot of people are taking what they say very seriously.
