22,17,I think the only person in your world who doesn't want a mask is a politician with a mask on.

What if I told my brother to not go to party and his dad showed him the gun"
22,17,I am going to go visit my mom now.

23,17,"I think the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. This is like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."

23,17,"In my opinion, he should have told me that the government should do more to stop the pandemic than to stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated."
24,17,So I'm doing something a bit different for you:
31,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,17,"There are very few issues that warrant a conversation like this. People don't make it a priority to talk about it. I think the conversation is all about what's going on. There is no need for ""how the government is doing that"" in the US and we don't have a common ground on that."
48,17,"I have no idea what that means, but I've heard it on a number of occasions. It's just that I never liked wearing my mask."
