40,9,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
48,9,thank you for requiring mask wearing in the house hall it is unfortunate a selfish delusional minority of house members must be forced to consider the welfare of others
49,9,masks are nothing but a placebo unless you have a surgical grade mask there really is no point even the sainted dr faucci admitted it at the beginning of all this i am pro vaccine my family are all cleared but the new idea that all the children need to be shot now is idiocy
1,9,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
7,9,i think you need to get your health insurance. the mask is too heavy.
9,35,And my face gets so hot and uncomfortable the mask should be over ur nose do u know tho that's how this went?
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,"Unless there is a 'who wants the vaccine' thing, it doesn't make sense. I don't understand why it's so bad that he's the one who's got to protect himself from it. It's probably not a bad idea to wear a mask to protect your friend."
20,9,"You need to put a tampon on, but you need to wear a mask."
27,9,Is there anyone who hasn't had an ill patient and hasn't been covered with a mask?
30,9,Tell me about your vote for Romney.
31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,"i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
48,9,IANAL but I would ask if anyone I see who doesn't wear a mask is wearing a mask for a flight on the job.
49,9,Well the masks don't stop it.
1,9,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
7,9,"I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like Trump has a mask in his wallet that has a huge awe of it on coaching baseball practice. So that's pretty awesome.'"

16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,"I think this should be an actual ""every day"" problem, rather than a purely logical answer."
20,9,"Oh, I'm not even a voter, but my friend who's a Democrat, wears a mask for his political campaigns. That's all there is to it."
27,9,"I mean, he's a man, but he doesn't need a mask, which is what people are complaining about?"
30,9,"Well, if you really don't want a vaccinated person, i think you should. Obviously you don't like to go to the doctor. And if you don't, then you should not be allowed to have them. What if you don't get the vaccine yourself? Do you feel like the first person who was in the room was hysterical with it?"
31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,"[Billy White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny. I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself. What if I told my brother to not go to a party and his dad showed him the gun i'm going to go buy him a gun. i"
48,9,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
49,9,... I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.
1,9,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
7,9,"The Obama administration is going to have to work to stop the spread of this pandemic. We don't know what the real reason is, but it's not as bad as it might seem."
9,35,So now I'm thinking of how it was?
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,"I think the point is that the people who aren't vaccinated are trying to discredit the people that are wearing them to get the vaccine. So if they want to have a fight, they can."
20,9,Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny. What if people want to go to the doctor? Aren't they given a right to wear a mask because they are sick? I don't know but i'm an immigrant.
27,9,"> I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. There's a guy in the uk who's been with us for four years with a face mask, who thinks he has a chance of stopping it."
30,9,"I think the 'hysterical' person is just using a slur to create a 'puppet' reaction, so maybe he's right."
31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,I think they should start a campaign about it. Why are they not trying to convince a voter to get a piece of legislation to prevent this kind of thing?
48,9,Why is your face covered with a mask?
49,9,A man who has been in this pandemic and a man who is still alive and has not been in the middle of it is in the middle. He has not even been in the middle.
1,9,>Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
7,9,Isn't the real purpose of a mask a mask? The fact that they're promoting it to young adults and the government are all the wrong ones.
9,35,"I don't think this is a political issue, it's just that I don't want to be involved in the pandemic."
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,"""Weird"" is a slur. It can make anyone feel terrible about themselves and they don't like to go to the doctor, but if you don't, you shouldn't have to take them off at the election. ""You've never heard anyone in a way that I would be the first one to do this."""

40,9,"I'm not sure what this is about, but this is not a thing we can be doing."
48,9,This is the sort of thing where there are a lot of ramblings about how people wear their masks to combat the pandemic and are asked to vote for changes.
49,9,This is pretty shady and funny. Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny.
1,9,"There's a real problem with being a face mask, that is why you're wearing it, in the first place. It's the best thing you can do."
7,9,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
9,35,"CANNOTANSWER was a very good player, and he deserves respect. What do you want to learn? He was born in Florida. He grew up in California and grew up in a big city. I remember reading a book in his elementary school about people who thought they weren't going to get vaccinated. I guess he felt the same way."
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,I'm actually more of a democrat than a Republican.
20,9,"The first word used to describe it is “the fact that the government is making it mandatory for people to wear a mask in the office. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it’s useless and I hate it."

49,9,>What is the significance of having a mask? Is it for the public benefit? Is it to the public interest? Or maybe even to the government to have it on you?
1,9,I am a little concerned because of my age.
7,9,He wasn't talking about vaccines. He was talking about the fact that he had to stop putting them on for everyone to be able to do something that was dangerous and even causing others to be unfit. He said he had to make sure the vaccine would stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated.
9,35,Why would you think people need to wear a mask when you are a teenager? Because you aren't in the workforce or something?
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,CANNOTANSWER:
20,9,"CANNOTANSWER: You're right, it's like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way. The government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
27,9,The fact that your brother's wife is wearing a mask at the gym is alarming to me.
30,9,CANNOTANSWER:
31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,I'm sorry that this is so critical. But this is a big red flag.
48,9,"""Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated? They were tamed to remove them."
49,9,I'm against it. But I can't make it out to be completely clear about why.
1,9,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
7,9,"I know you are worried about the risks and concerns that I can see and understand, but not for the upcoming pandemic. It's a pandemic that could happen if the government was willing to do that. But it's a pandemic that will have to be dealt with."
9,35,I am a little concerned because I am not a physician
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,"CANNOTANSWER told his family that if they wore a mask all the time and it was uncomfortable for them, they might be entitled to wear a mask."
20,9,"""The government is doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic.

49,9,That is a valid explanation.
1,9,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
7,9,"I think the government needs to have a ""safety check"" with the government to see what's going on."
9,35,I can tell you that I am very concerned about CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,That's the kind of thing I'm going to say that I don't feel comfortable with when I'm not at school.
20,9,"Obama wants to get the narrator to make his comments on vaccines a real issue, and he has to do so in an effort to get people to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff."

40,9,It's a joke.
48,9,"It isn't like a lot of people are talking about a pandemic, it's a large epidemic."
49,9,"I think a few people were influenced by the context, and it was probably in the context of what a CANNOTANSWER threw out and he was the only one who did this."
1,9,How much are he paid?
7,9,"I know, right? I was referring to people who thought he was a good politician. I just don't like wearing masks in public"

31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,"What about the guy who has been a teen who wears a mask all the time and is afraid of getting infected? What if they went in a crowded place, asked if anyone would wear a mask on him?"
48,9,"As a politician I get the etiquette of I don't want to wear a mask, as it is so painfully necessary. However, I don't care about my wife. She needs to make sure her husband stays healthy, and there is a reason her husband has to keep putting a face mask on her face. If she is not comfortable wearing one, I can see how it can be harmful. Then I can start to worry about her. I know that some people may find the remark to be a part of some etiquette of the federal"

I'm not a big fan of all of these people saying that they are not a doctor, but I am saying that if you aren't a doctor, the government should look after you. The way this explains things is that people will be upset about it and they will complain about it. But they will also be upset if you get into the mindset that if you are a conservative and a bigot, you can just continue to make sense of the problem, that"
1,9,CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice.
7,9,Why is he paying people to be in the midst of the pandemic?
9,35,"He's paid a lot for not wearing his mask when he's out on the street in the middle of a pandemic, and you're getting your money's worth from it."
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

27,9,"CANNOTANSWER is a very intelligent, and responsible, man who has made a career in healthcare and has been making a career out of it and is still working."
30,9,I don't know what the actual problem is. What I do know is that the government has the power to prevent pandemics and the government does not. It doesn't work against people who are vaccinated against the virus. It works against people who are vaccinated against the virus.
31,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
40,9,You're pretty much in a position to be concerned with the dangers of wearing a mask in public. I think you should understand what I mean.
48,9,I like your first sentence. I'm not going to argue that it's a good idea to not wear a mask. I want to do more research on this than I can do on the topic of vaccinations. I think that is not what he was suggesting at the time.
49,9,"I know what you mean. I was thinking about how to go about it. It was a little scary, but he didn't say anything that sounded exactly like what he would say in an article. I don't want to give him a lot of details because I think it might be a little creepy but you're right about it."
1,9,It's the government's responsibility to tell people the dangers of the pandemic.
7,9,I've heard all of these from people who were able to join the military.
9,35,"I don't know, I just know he gets paid very little, especially since he's an American. I am in the military, and I've never heard of this kind of thing. That's just how the government is supposed to be. I'm pretty sure he has no intention of'representing' himself as such, but he's a very well known politician."
16,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,9,Who says that the government has the power to prevent pandemics?
20,9,"[Brown, she wore a mask because she was not a doctor and was not a doctor]. It is not a'shady stuff' that she can do to fight the pandemic and a 'right' to be concerned about."
27,9,"I think a lot of the government's role is to protect against the spread of a pandemic, but it does not go far enough to prevent another one."
30,9,"I guess it's a privilege. I don't see any morally incorrect or equivocal explanations or questions for what the new law is about. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here. I've always thought that being a teen like that causes the rash of pandemics? “This is just a big red flag.

27,9,"That's a pretty good question, but a little cynical at the same time. It's hard to say when you have a point here, but to me it sounds like the general stance is that people are a little bit'snobby' for having a mask, even if they aren't quite the same, if they can't really make a point in any way. It's hard to say, as a general rule, that you're a really good idea to have a mask"
