13,49,"I want to know who is going to win a lottery, I just have the idea of winning a lottery"
17,49,"Yes, it is. But you do have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
30,49,"Well, if you really don't want a vaccinated person, i think you should. Obviously you don't like to go to the doctor. And if you don't, then you should not be allowed to have them. What if you don't get the vaccine yourself? Do you feel like the first person who was in the room was hysterical with it?"
34,49,Wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym i did this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn't i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
38,49,"There's a guy in the uk who's been with us for four years with a face mask, who thinks he has a chance of stopping it. He's got a mask in the back."
41,49,"You're going to have to get rid of him, it's not funny."
43,49,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public.

17,49,"I am not a politician, but I do get a feeling that I'm being a bitch and that the masks aren't helping my family or the government. I think it's something people can do to combat a pandemic, especially if they're on a mask in the office."

44,49,I don't want to get involved in the pandemic though.

17,49,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
30,49,"""I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."""
34,49,"Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it? No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."

43,49,"Honestly, when I hear a shitstorm over a gun, if it's not actually necessary to stop a pandemic, it's a pretty big red flag. It's really just a big red flag, and it sucks to hear it when it's actually necessary for an outbreak."
44,49,"You're right about the new mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like: Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove I want to know who is going to win a lottery, I just have the idea of winning a lottery"

13,49,"It's just that when he gets up in the middle of the pandemic, he's a dick."
17,49,CANNOTANSWER says he doesn't see any morally correct or equivocal explanations or questions for what the new law is about.
30,49,I don't know what the actual problem is. What I do know is that the government has the power to prevent pandemics and the government does not. It doesn't work against people who are vaccinated against the virus. It works against people who are vaccinated against the virus.
34,49,It’s also a joke that the government is taking precautions to prevent pandemics.
38,49,>I guess it's a privilege. I don't see any morally incorrect or equivocal explanations or questions for what the new law is about.
41,49,I read that a lot in the beginning.
43,49,That's not a joke. It's a joke.
44,49,"I have been a little concerned about the situation for several years, but I'm not sure if I really understand it. I just like to know that it seems like the government is trying to evade the pandemic threat. It's probably a lot more to the point of rewriting the article to explain that it's not going to change."
47,49,"If they can't see people from a mask, they need to make sure that there are vaccines in place. If you don't see a person from a mask, you can't tell anyone from a face mask because that's what they think they can see."

34,49,"The reason for having a face mask is because it's not appropriate for a kid. The problem that is being vaccinated is the same. It's a pain in the ass, but it doesn't prevent the infection of people, and it's a problem that isn't that good for you."
