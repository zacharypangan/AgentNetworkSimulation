I'm not a big fan of all of these people saying that they are not a doctor, but I am saying that if you aren't a doctor, the government should look after you. The way this explains things is that people will be upset about it and they will complain about it. But they will also be upset if you get into the mindset that if you are a conservative and a bigot, you can just continue to make sense of the problem, that"

32,16,I don't think the government should be aware of what the pandemic is about. This is the correct response.
42,16,If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.
44,16,"I have been a little concerned about the situation for several years, but I'm not sure if I really understand it. I just like to know that it seems like the government is trying to evade the pandemic threat. It's probably a lot more to the point of rewriting the article to explain that it's not going to change."
49,16,"I know what you mean. I was thinking about how to go about it. It was a little scary, but he didn't say anything that sounded exactly like what he would say in an article. I don't want to give him a lot of details because I think it might be a little creepy but you're right about it."
5,16,CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie.
8,16,CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice. CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice. CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice. CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice.
10,16,That's how the government is trying to be the best.
12,16,CANNOTANSWER is referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government.

32,16,"There's a lot of good advice here - I would go to a medical center to find a new face mask and get vaccinated but because I'm a teen and I want my own, I'm afraid, as a human being, to go see a doctor who specializes in this subject - and I will go see a doctor who specializes in this subject. I'm concerned that when it comes to pandemics I'm going to start being a bit too worried that the doctors in a certain amount of them - and "
42,16,"That's a pretty good question, but a little cynical at the same time. It's hard to say when you have a point here, but to me it sounds like the general stance is that people are a little bit'snobby' for having a mask, even if they aren't quite the same, if they can't really make a point in any way. It's hard to say, as a general rule, that you're a really good idea to have a mask in public, even"
44,16,"What is your favorite quote from the show, ""Cannotanker? Are you going to come on this show?"

5,16,I don't like these quotes. I'm interested in the conversation.
8,16,The show Cannotanker is about a guy he knew who was very good at helping people with their HIV. He says he is concerned about the pandemic and has been to a doctor and is a very good politician.
10,16,"The only joke I can think of right now is, 'Cannotanker'."
12,16,Can you imagine a movie where I don't know how to explain 'Cannotanker'?

49,16,I think you have a good point. Is the fact that the government is trying to evade pandemics because it's hard to talk about and it's a joke to just say that's a joke?
5,16,It's a joke. What's the point of it?
8,16,It's a big red flag. He's not a joke. He's an asshole.
10,16,That's an awesome quote.

20,16,CANNOTANSWER'S response:
32,16,"I am not sure what exactly you mean. I do believe that a cigarette is a good idea, but that a face mask isn’t just meant for your eyes and eyes. But it does help in preventing the spread of the virus. That and a few other things."
42,16,They were tamed to remove them. But that's not a good idea and it's also a joke.
44,16,CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie. CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie.

32,16,That's a really good read.
42,16,"Are you trying to say he's a politician, a doctor or something else?"
44,16,"No. That's not how the president is. He doesn't want to be involved. But he doesn't want to be involved, as a lawyer, so he's not a good politician. What he said was a lie and he didn't want to be involved. The president was obviously a bad politician, as well as a politician."
49,16,"So when the President refuses to eat a pizza at his home, he doesn't really want to wear a face mask?"

20,16,CANNOTANSWER. What is the name of a movie?
32,16,">what he said was a lie. CANNOTANSWER is a cynical politician. What are you saying about the government, a lawyer? I’m a lawyer, and we have this conversation about the government and what you need to understand about the problem and how to deal with it. ""I don’t want to be involved."""
42,16,"The post's title has a link to a great article that mentions the current presidential situation and this comment has been upvoted down to zero because the post's title doesn't seem to suggest that the president would be able to get rid of this guy. It might not be clear to everyone else, but the main issue here is whether the president has the resources to keep his mind on the current issue and the situation. It's also a nice little joke."
44,16,i'm not a lawyer. i have to say that i think it's a joke.
49,16,"""I think you should say: ""What a dick! I hate vaccines! I'd love to have some. We all have our reasons!"""""
