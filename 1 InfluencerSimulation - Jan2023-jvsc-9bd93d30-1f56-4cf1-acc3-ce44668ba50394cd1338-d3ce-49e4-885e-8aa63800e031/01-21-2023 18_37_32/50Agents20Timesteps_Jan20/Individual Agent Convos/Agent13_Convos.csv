34,13,"This guy is so smart. His comments are almost unhelpful and make me think about the whole situation. He may have the wrong idea about masks, but the government needs to be more vigilant. I can’t even imagine him wearing a face mask, as he is wearing masks for a personal use. He can’t do anything else that may help prevent it from spreading."
