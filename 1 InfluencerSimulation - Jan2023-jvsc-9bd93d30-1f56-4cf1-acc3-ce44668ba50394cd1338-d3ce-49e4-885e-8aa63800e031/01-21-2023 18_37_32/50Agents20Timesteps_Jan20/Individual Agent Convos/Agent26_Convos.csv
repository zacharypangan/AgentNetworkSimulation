38,26,how i feel after taking off my n mask after every hour shift
49,26,masks are nothing but a placebo unless you have a surgical grade mask there really is no point even the sainted dr faucci admitted it at the beginning of all this i am pro vaccine my family are all cleared but the new idea that all the children need to be shot now is idiocy
1,26,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
7,26,i think you need to get your health insurance. the mask is too heavy.
12,26,I'm not a big fan of superspice events. I'm not a huge fan of any other type of violence that people use.

30,26,Tell me about your vote for Romney.
32,26,Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
38,26,i do... i don't really care what you say
49,26,Well the masks don't stop it.
1,26,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
7,26,"I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like Trump has a mask in his wallet that has a huge awe of it on coaching baseball practice. So that's pretty awesome.'"
12,26,I'm not sure what you mean by 'even with a mask on coaching baseball practice this morning on a beautiful almost fall day was incredibly refreshing'.

30,26,"Well, if you really don't want a vaccinated person, i think you should. Obviously you don't like to go to the doctor. And if you don't, then you should not be allowed to have them. What if you don't get the vaccine yourself? Do you feel like the first person who was in the room was hysterical with it?"
32,26,Are you still interested in what the government did to stop a child from having the virus?
38,26,"There's a guy in the uk who's been with us for four years with a face mask, who thinks he has a chance of stopping it. He's got a mask in the back."
49,26,... I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.
1,26,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?

30,26,"I think the 'hysterical' person is just using a slur to create a 'puppet' reaction, so maybe he's right."
32,26,"I feel like I need to be more serious and aware of what this is like, too. I like to think about things like that too."
38,26,"It is ridiculous. When I see an older person wearing a mask I fuck up and think they're cool and cool and like how they are, it annoys me. I'm always afraid it's the most dangerous thing to be wearing. I don't see why the government can't be involved in it if there is no way to prevent the effects."
49,26,A man who has been in this pandemic and a man who is still alive and has not been in the middle of it is in the middle. He has not even been in the middle.
1,26,>Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
7,26,Isn't the real purpose of a mask a mask? The fact that they're promoting it to young adults and the government are all the wrong ones.
12,26,I'm very not interested in going to the party and seeing a mask. It's a terrible idea to want to be involved in the pandemic if people don't want to.

32,26,How can someone make a teen feel horrible about having to wear a mask when they are already being vaccinated? What is the difference between having a mask and a face mask?
38,26,The government is trying to prevent this stuff for good reasons. They need to get a bill passed before it starts.
49,26,This is pretty shady and funny. Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny.

49,26,>What is the significance of having a mask? Is it for the public benefit? Is it to the public interest? Or maybe even to the government to have it on you?
1,26,I am a little concerned because of my age.
7,26,He wasn't talking about vaccines. He was talking about the fact that he had to stop putting them on for everyone to be able to do something that was dangerous and even causing others to be unfit. He said he had to make sure the vaccine would stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated.
12,26,"I don't want to say, but I think people who are a teen should be in a position to change. I think it's important for the government to do more to prevent the pandemic, and so the government shouldn't do anything else."

32,26,This CANNOTANSWER is very edgy. In the middle of a pandemic. I feel terrible for my parents.
38,26,CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer. A doctor isn't a lawyer. A doctor isn't a lawyer. CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer.
49,26,I'm against it. But I can't make it out to be completely clear about why.
1,26,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
7,26,"I know you are worried about the risks and concerns that I can see and understand, but not for the upcoming pandemic. It's a pandemic that could happen if the government was willing to do that. But it's a pandemic that will have to be dealt with."
12,26,"I'm in a pandemic, and I don't think I'm going to be part of the pandemic. The reason I'm not in a pandemic is because I don't think the government is aware of the risk involved.

38,26,"Is a mask a problem or a privilege? I am not sure, but a mask is just another person."
49,26,That is a valid explanation.
1,26,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
7,26,"I think the government needs to have a ""safety check"" with the government to see what's going on."
12,26,"People don't go out of their way to hide fear, but it's easy to not notice when they are being abused. I would just ignore it. You're being a dick for having a nose that's too large and so blotchy, and it won't get any better without it."

I'm not a big fan of all of these people saying that they are not a doctor, but I am saying that if you aren't a doctor, the government should look after you.

But they will also be upset if you get into the mindset that if you are a conservative and a bigot, you can just continue to make sense of the problem, that"
