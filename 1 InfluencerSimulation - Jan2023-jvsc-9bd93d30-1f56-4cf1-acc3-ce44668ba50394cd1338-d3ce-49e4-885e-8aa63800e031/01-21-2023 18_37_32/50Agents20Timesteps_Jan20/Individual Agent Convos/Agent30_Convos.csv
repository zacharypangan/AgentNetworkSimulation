19,30,"Unless there is a 'who wants the vaccine' thing, it doesn't make sense. I don't understand why it's so bad that he's the one who's got to protect himself from it. It's probably not a bad idea to wear a mask to protect your friend."
20,30,"You need to put a tampon on, but you need to wear a mask."
22,30,I think the only person in your world who doesn't want a mask is a politician with a mask on.

15,30,"Well, I would like to say that the best thing you can do to prevent a pandemic is to help people who haven't been vaccinated."
16,30,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,30,"I think this should be an actual ""every day"" problem, rather than a purely logical answer."
20,30,"Oh, I'm not even a voter, but my friend who's a Democrat, wears a mask for his political campaigns. That's all there is to it."
