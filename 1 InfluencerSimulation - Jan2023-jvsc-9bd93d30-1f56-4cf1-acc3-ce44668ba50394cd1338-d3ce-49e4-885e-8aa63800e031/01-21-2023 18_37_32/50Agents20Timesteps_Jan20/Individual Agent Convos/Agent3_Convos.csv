42,3,"That's a pretty good question, but a little cynical at the same time. It's hard to say when you have a point here, but to me it sounds like the general stance is that people are a little bit'snobby' for having a mask, even if they aren't quite the same, if they can't really make a point in any way. It's hard to say, as a general rule, that you're a really good idea to have a mask in public, even"

18,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,3,I don't see any morally correct or equivocal explanations or questions. The government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening. (https://www.newswire.com/newswire-details/en.html). The only thing that would stop the pandemic is if it spreads through the nation. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.
23,3,The question is - do you have any moral issues?
38,3,I don't like that that quote was the same person I was talking to.
