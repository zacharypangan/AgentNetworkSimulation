35,2,i did this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center
37,2,the fact that wearing a mask is headline news vs just an assumption is a sad reality imagine seriously think about how you would react to reading the following in january of gov andrew cuomo wears pants as he arrives at the white house

30,2,Tell me about your vote for Romney.
33,2,Why is it useless and I hate it? It is something that makes people feel safe. Then I stop and start getting vaccinated.
35,2,'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.'
37,2,"You're the one who says that? I gotta ask the question because it's very, very difficult to say if you think I'm referring to the word pandemic. You say your business is a pandemic. But this is so ridiculous."
40,2,"i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
46,2,IANAL - but i read that and i think it was the person who was hysterical with it?

30,2,"Well, if you really don't want a vaccinated person, i think you should. Obviously you don't like to go to the doctor. And if you don't, then you should not be allowed to have them. What if you don't get the vaccine yourself? Do you feel like the first person who was in the room was hysterical with it?"
33,2,"i haven't had the benefit of the doubt, and i wouldn't want to get in a fight with my friend to prevent the pandemic."
35,2,"No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."
37,2,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.

30,2,I don't know what the actual problem is. What I do know is that the government has the power to prevent pandemics and the government does not. It doesn't work against people who are vaccinated against the virus. It works against people who are vaccinated against the virus.
33,2,It's a good point.
35,2,"The government is taking a very cautious approach. It's not the ""right"" to go out there and use a mask, and it's the right to not go."

35,2,"As someone who's been in the military, I'd say they are a lot more responsible and responsible in their policy decisions than many people are willing to do. A doctor isn't a lawyer, and I guess it's because that's their career decision.
