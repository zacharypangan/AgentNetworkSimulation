2,43,It's a pretty good thing that people get sick.
3,43,"It should be a choice, and people have the right to wear them."
4,43,A little girl who is now a coach at the local university has been given a mask on her first day to the practice. It's quite a privilege to be a coach.
20,43,"You need to put a tampon on, but you need to wear a mask."
29,43,> if you vote biden you will be singing with a mask on because he will make masks mandatory for life a muffled sebastian bach
37,43,"You're the one who says that? I gotta ask the question because it's very, very difficult to say if you think I'm referring to the word pandemic. You say your business is a pandemic. But this is so ridiculous."

29,43,i have to say the first two digits of the vaccinated code should be the first to say that
37,43,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.

49,43,I'm against it. But I can't make it out to be completely clear about why.
1,43,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
2,43,"The obama administration has been a bit over-sensitive with this. His comments on vaccines are just a little gross, and he's trying to get us to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff, and it's a real issue here."
3,43,People seem to think they have enough money to help them.

20,43,"""The government is doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic.

29,43,What happened if the narrator refused to wear a mask?
37,43,"A child is a privilege - it's not only to go out there and wear a mask - it's also to be more aware of what they wear while they are at school. They must be able to see what they are wearing. Unless they are wearing a mask, they cannot be confident enough to do so. They have to know that they are at school and who they are being held accountable for their actions, and that they should be able to have access to their privacy."
40,43,"This isn't even the first time you've heard that. I guess you're right it's a big red flag. What does a mask and a mask have to do with a person who is a teen? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

1,43,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
2,43,"""But if you did not and acted improperly or wrongly, you'll be out of a problem. You're not a doctor. That's why you're wearing a mask. If you're a doctor, you should not be wearing a mask at all. Why are you being a dick?"
3,43,I don't think a CANNOTANSWER is going to be able to prevent a pandemic but isn't sure what the real problem is.
4,43,"I’m very comfortable with having a face mask. But a normal face mask can never stop the virus, and that’s exactly why it can’t stop people from a pandemic."
20,43,"Obama wants to get the narrator to make his comments on vaccines a real issue, and he has to do so in an effort to get people to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff."
29,43,"I can't remember the name of the song, but I heard that one from a friend in high school who said he was too tired for a face mask and had a bad reaction when he asked why."
37,43,They are a privilege. I don't see any morally incorrect or equivocal explanations or questions for what the new law is about. It's just not an example.

1,43,How much are he paid?
2,43,Are there any issues with wearing a face mask?
3,43,I'm a little concerned because of my age.
4,43,I think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
20,43,>Why does being a teen like this cause the rash of pandemics?

The way this explains things is that people will be upset about it and they will complain about it. But they will also be upset if you get into the mindset that if you are a conservative and a bigot, you can just continue to make sense of the problem, that"
1,43,CANNOTANSWER sounds very nice.
2,43,"When the news is out, and he is on TV, how about a tv show?"
3,43,"In the end, I don't even care about how much he is paid. I've worked as a therapist and have never seen a doctor without my mask in my life."

1,43,It's the government's responsibility to tell people the dangers of the pandemic.

4,43,"You don't sound very good at citing any of the facts - you are quoting people who are a very good politician, that are fliers on the news, that are in the midst of the pandemic. You may be quoting some people that do not want to be involved in the pandemic."
