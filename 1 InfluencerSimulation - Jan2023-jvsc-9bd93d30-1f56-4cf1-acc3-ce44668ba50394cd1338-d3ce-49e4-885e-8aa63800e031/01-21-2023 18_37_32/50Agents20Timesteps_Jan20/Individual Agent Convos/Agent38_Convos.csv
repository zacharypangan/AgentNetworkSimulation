49,38,masks are nothing but a placebo unless you have a surgical grade mask there really is no point even the sainted dr faucci admitted it at the beginning of all this i am pro vaccine my family are all cleared but the new idea that all the children need to be shot now is idiocy
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
2,38,It's a pretty good thing that people get sick.
7,38,i think you need to get your health insurance. the mask is too heavy.
10,38,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
12,38,I'm not a big fan of superspice events. I'm not a huge fan of any other type of violence that people use.
13,38,"i agree with this, it's a stupid, dumb law."
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,Have you tried lowering your mask to cough?

39,38,It was awesome. I wear a mask while a team is getting vaccines for a virus and when the virus spreads it's pretty cool to see.
43,38,I’m going to go buy you a gun.
49,38,Well the masks don't stop it.
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
2,38,"I have to go, and think about this."
7,38,"I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like Trump has a mask in his wallet that has a huge awe of it on coaching baseball practice. So that's pretty awesome.'"
10,38,So what did this guy just say?... if he could if he'd only given his signature in a letter...
12,38,I'm not sure what you mean by 'even with a mask on coaching baseball practice this morning on a beautiful almost fall day was incredibly refreshing'.
13,38,"I want to know who is going to win a lottery, I just have the idea of winning a lottery"
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it?
38,3,"There's a guy in the uk who's been with us for four years with a face mask, who thinks he has a chance of stopping it. He's got a mask in the back."

39,38,I've been a baseball coach at a local university. I'm sure you're a fan of my thigh mask fetish.
43,38,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
49,38,... I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.

7,38,"The Obama administration is going to have to work to stop the spread of this pandemic. We don't know what the real reason is, but it's not as bad as it might seem."
10,38,The Obama administration is not in it.
12,38,> Are you still interested in what the government did to stop a child from having the virus?
13,38,"I'm not an idiot, but you're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic."
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,>How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one?
38,3,"It is ridiculous. When I see an older person wearing a mask I fuck up and think they're cool and cool and like how they are, it annoys me. I'm always afraid it's the most dangerous thing to be wearing. I don't see why the government can't be involved in it if there is no way to prevent the effects."

39,38,"Have you tried lowering your mask to cough? 'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.' i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
43,38,"A new, unproven, shady law is like the [Lenny White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny. I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself. What if I told my brother to not go to party and his dad showed"
49,38,A man who has been in this pandemic and a man who is still alive and has not been in the middle of it is in the middle. He has not even been in the middle.
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,>Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
2,38,"The fact that the government's doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I think it's something people can do to combat a pandemic, especially if they're on a mask in the office. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,38,Isn't the real purpose of a mask a mask? The fact that they're promoting it to young adults and the government are all the wrong ones.
10,38,"That's a good question, but that's not the question I'm putting up here. "
12,38,I'm very not interested in going to the party and seeing a mask. It's a terrible idea to want to be involved in the pandemic if people don't want to.
13,38,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. I'm going to go buy you a gun. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.

39,38,Unless you're a hugely anti-vaccine person. This is not an anti-vaccination thing.
43,38,"Honestly, when I hear a shitstorm over a gun, if it's not actually necessary to stop a pandemic, it's a pretty big red flag. It's really just a big red flag, and it sucks to hear it when it's actually necessary for an outbreak."
49,38,This is pretty shady and funny. Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny.
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,"There's a real problem with being a face mask, that is why you're wearing it, in the first place. It's the best thing you can do."
2,38,"It's like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
7,38,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.

39,38,>How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one?
43,38,"That's so blatantly misleading. This is a fact, in my opinion, that people need to stop making any comments about a person who is doing it. They can't just ignore the fact that you don't care about the outcome of their conversation. They can't even really stop thinking about the issue, either."
49,38,>What is the significance of having a mask? Is it for the public benefit? Is it to the public interest? Or maybe even to the government to have it on you?
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,I am a little concerned because of my age.
2,38,I think it's time for you to consider the fact that CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
7,38,He wasn't talking about vaccines. He was talking about the fact that he had to stop putting them on for everyone to be able to do something that was dangerous and even causing others to be unfit. He said he had to make sure the vaccine would stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated.
10,38,"That's how the government treats kids, that's why CANNOTANSWER's dad was in a public school."
12,38,"I don't want to say, but I think people who are a teen should be in a position to change. I think it's important for the government to do more to prevent the pandemic, and so the government shouldn't do anything else."
13,38,"I'm not a doctor, I'm a human, not a physician. If I were you, I wouldn't wear my mask at all. I wear my face mask to prevent pneumonia, and I don't want to do any harm. :("
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,This is a large part of the conversation.
38,3,CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer. A doctor isn't a lawyer. A doctor isn't a lawyer. CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer.

39,38,There are some really great reasons to leave. It's kind of like the government wanting you to put it on their face and reclaim it as a privilege instead of an inconvenience.
43,38,"I'm a huge fan of the ""I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it? No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today."
49,38,I'm against it. But I can't make it out to be completely clear about why.
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
2,38,"The obama administration has been a bit over-sensitive with this. His comments on vaccines are just a little gross, and he's trying to get us to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff, and it's a real issue here."
7,38,"I know you are worried about the risks and concerns that I can see and understand, but not for the upcoming pandemic. It's a pandemic that could happen if the government was willing to do that. But it's a pandemic that will have to be dealt with."
10,38,I don't think people can stand the fact that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics. I think the fact that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics is something they should be concerned about.
12,38,"I'm in a pandemic, and I don't think I'm going to be part of the pandemic. The reason I'm not in a pandemic is because I don't think the government is aware of the risk involved. It's not like they have a choice. You don't have the choice, you have to make a decision that's the best thing you can do."
13,38,I'm just thinking about it.
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,"A friend of mine went to school for a'mask ', and was shocked to see his father wear a mask all the time."
38,3,"Is a mask a problem or a privilege? I am not sure, but a mask is just another person."
38,15,"Is a mask a problem or a privilege? I am not sure, but a mask is just another person."

43,38,"You're not a doctor. You're not a doctor. That's why you're wearing a mask. You're a human, not a physician. If you're a doctor, you should not be wearing a mask at all."
49,38,That is a valid explanation.
50,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
1,38,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
2,38,"""But if you did not and acted improperly or wrongly, you'll be out of a problem. You're not a doctor. That's why you're wearing a mask. If you're a doctor, you should not be wearing a mask at all. Why are you being a dick?"
7,38,"I think the government needs to have a ""safety check"" with the government to see what's going on."
10,38,"They could be afraid of the pandemic. CANNOTANSWER isn't a doctor, he's a human, not a doctor. If they knew that they could not see anyone from a mask, and therefore he is infected, they'd have a pretty good reason to wear a face mask."
12,38,"People don't go out of their way to hide fear, but it's easy to not notice when they are being abused. I would just ignore it. You're being a dick for having a nose that's too large and so blotchy, and it won't get any better without it."
13,38,"I mean, you need to be aware of the dangers of wearing a mask, and of what they are wearing, and how they are not wearing them."
16,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,38,"CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the ""I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved"" line of argument?"
