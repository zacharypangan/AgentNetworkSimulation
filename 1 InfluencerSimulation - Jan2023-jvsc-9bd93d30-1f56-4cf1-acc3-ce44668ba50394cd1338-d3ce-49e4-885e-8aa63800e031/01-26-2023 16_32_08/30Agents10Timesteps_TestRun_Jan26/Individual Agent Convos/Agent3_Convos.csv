7,3,"As a Texan living in California, I think this idea is just a little weird, I mean, like me or other people who are going to work. Maybe it works in some states, but it can also work elsewhere."
8,3,"OP: It's more about the mask protecting other people, not the mask protecting other people he only cares about himself."
15,3,My friend is a nurse and has an appointment to come with me in April so if you have the same concern then that's when the symptoms are coming back. And that's when it hurts.

8,3,Thanks for not thinking so much about it. I can't be the guy that would wear a mask while on the field and get scared.
15,3,Are you sure you don't want to be taken out by a virus that isn't gone?

7,3,"I am a Texan and my husband lives in a conservative county. He lives in a Republican state. He and I are Texan citizens. We don't even have a texan government, which is basically the governing body of the state.... and then a special shout out goes to Mr. Latorre and Ms. Latorre, we love the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from cor"
8,3,"Yeah, but they do want to be the best team in the world - that's why you get to wear masks."
15,3,"It's been a week, and you've done a great job of clearing this up. People are caring about their health and they care about the fucking people who are putting up with it. I hope you find a therapist whose job you enjoy, not just a nurse, that is helping you to find a better solution to this."
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,I think the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask.
8,3,"OP, and the rest of us are just people, and he is making a joke out of it. It's not like he is trying to be funny, but it's the wrong thing to think."
15,3,"Well if you can't tell me about the masks, there's no better way."
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"... and then a special shout out goes to Ms. Latorre, we love the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya Please wear a mask amp bend over Please wear a mask amp bend over ""That would probably be a good idea. If you had to wear a mask to go outside, it'd actually help prevent the virus and make it worse. Why not just go with me?"" hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey"
8,3,I never heard the joke that he was trying to make himself funny but he makes fun of other people
15,3,"I was in a hospital with a few people who were not vaccinated. Some people don't, but in my case, my friend was vaccinated. I waited for a patient to get a test and if they didn't get vaccinated, they just didn't do it."
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"""I have a friend who is allergic to a brittle brittle - a brittle - a brittle - a brittle - brittle - brittle - brittle - brittle - brittle - brittle - brittle"
8,3,I think he just means that he's trying to be funny.
15,3,"""They are doing a good job of cleaning up the public health care system, not the sick people. i'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p"

7,3,"It seems that as a new kid this is one of the worst times I've ever been in rap. The first thing I said was, ""I'm a new kid and I love the idea of being in the center of a group of people that just aren't the best for each other. I think that's one of the most terrifying things to ever happen to me."
8,3,I have to say that this is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous.
15,3,"It's my own personal experience and I'm just a little scared of a viral infection - my life is too wacky to care enough to not have a mask, even if I don't want to."
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,I feel like people are so cynical about the whole thing because of it.
8,3,"""Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous. I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,3,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park."
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"As a woman who used to work at a drug store I would use a mask and say something along the lines of ""Hey, this is weird and a little creepy"", but not funny in the sense that it's hilarious and doesn't necessarily have a big effect."
8,3,Isn't this one - you're still alive? It doesn't look funny.
15,3,I'd say it's a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self esteem.
6,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
7,3,"This is what the movie's titled, ""The Devil Wears a Mask"". It's a drama and is a very effective way to stop the virus in its tracks."
8,3,">Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous."
15,3,"I have a couple of people who wear masks while in the hospital. They're my own friends and I'm one. They're a friend, and I think it's nice to see that they are wearing masks. I would be super interested in hearing about this at my friends. My friend likes to do stuff outside while he's vaccinated, and he's wearing masks when he's not vaccinated. He's a friend, and he loves me and is trying to make me feel like he's going around"
