28,19,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
19,1,"Yes, it's really interesting in light of people's resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy"
19,6,"Its interesting that the nvp sports park is not a public park, and the people who wear them are supposed to be free. This means that there is only one open play in the park"

19,15,i don't think there is much that makes a play more appealing than a mask.
28,19,I know it seems a little silly but it would make a good point to add it to the list :)

19,6,"My friend did this. He says that it's important to learn to be socially aware of the environment and not make it a public park a place where people can play. He said it's very much more than just a private park, but that if you have kids or don't have a family you have to learn to interact with others. He said that people are really afraid of being exposed to that environment, not that they are supposed to know what it's like to be a part of the environment."
19,11,There is actually a great public art exhibit on the playground that's a little different i believe.
19,15,I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p
28,19,"If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them."
19,1,I never actually play painting games but have a real problem with the one in the park. I can see the nvp sports park being pretty popular but it would probably be more interesting to see a public park full of people who want to play instead of just having fun with one.
19,6,They should also teach a couple of people not to wear masks. The one thing they do is teach them to think with a sarcasm lens :(
19,11,"i mean i never really said that it's different or a public park, I just feel like i just have to work to keep a private park as a family."
19,15,What's the point of having a public art exhibit in a park? Because we're all there for fun.
28,19,That's the kind of way to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
19,1,I grew up in a city with an extremely expensive park in it and no one cared to go to it. It is not a public park and it is just a way for kids to participate and enjoy.
19,6,I can think of a lot of good stuff on the nvp sports park - but the public park is full of people. It's too much of a stretch.
19,11,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I went to a public park for some art exhibit. She was pretty impressed. I just didn't get a chance to go. So, I decided to go with it, and I like it. She just likes the idea of having a public park for the kids and being friends with friends and strangers. We would all like to go with my friends in general, and we really appreciate the open play and the art. It's a place for kids. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on"
19,15,"I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park. So I wonder what it would be like to have a public art exhibit in a park that is not a public park, and the people who wear them are supposed to be free."
28,19,Then I'd read some of this post. What the fuck?

19,15,I'm actually a fan of nvp sports and I wouldn't care about having a public park in a public park. It's a shithole shithole.
28,19,"There's another one that seems to be interesting on this. In a way, this isn't just the man who cry."
19,1,"Then, for me, I guess I just know there is no place for kids to go and I feel that I've made enough money on the art show to get into it. So, my comment is merely my personal opinion. I don't think anyone likes it if you're afraid of being exposed to an environment that's a little different than mine. It's a bit unfair to say that I love the park, but I'm sure you're very happy with the idea of a public park because there's no reason not to have a public park."
19,6,"I think this is one of the most tame topics in this subreddit. It's more about people trying to get a ""get out of my car"" attitude, instead of an actual ""go to the park""."
19,11,I don't even think you're a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks. The ones you are.
19,15,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park."
28,19,>Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not?
19,1,"People who don't wear a mask will have trouble with it. The old man is an idiot, and if the public park has a problem, it has a problem."
19,6,"You're just trying to put me on a pedestal and be the person I am. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I can imagine how that would be a nice thing to have. I'm sure it would be a great way to build up community."
19,11,"The entire point of a public park is a way for kids to have fun. You don't think people have to wear masks to experience a park that is just a public place. The people who go to the park are not allowed to be entertained, because it's a playground. Neither does a nvp sports park. That's just a playground for kids."
19,15,"I've been to several public parks where you and I haven't been, I think this is where I need to get my head around."
28,19,There's a good one called The Human Paradox that looks like a mirror. The movie is so fucked up and the subject is so interesting that you can't even even think about it without a second look!

19,6,I'm not sure you would want a public park. I'd want a playground with a public art exhibit. But my girlfriend wouldn't like it.
19,11,I can't see the tv show.
19,15,I have a bunch of friends who like to go to museums and enjoy the beauty of the park.
28,19,It's a good story. I'll take a second look.

19,6,The Human Paradox is a good one.
19,11,It seems like a good idea.
19,15,I'm a fan of it. But this is just a playground.
28,19,"> I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before."

19,6,"IANAL. It's a good film, which it is on TV, and I've read about it in other places before."
19,11,Why would you be concerned about kids coming to play in a playground?
19,15,I have a favorite movie called The Human Paradox. It's a very good movie.
28,19,I just read a book in my free time and it made me realize that the only thing I can think of that doesn't have to do with the mask is the fact that I've been wearing it for a while.
