8,3,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
9,8,mask protect other people he only cares about himself
8,2,"I've always wondered how the guys at The L.A.C. team could be a better match, or would the fans be more likely to be in the team."
8,3,"OP: It's more about the mask protecting other people, not the mask protecting other people he only cares about himself."
9,8,I don't care to put a mask on when I go in for a job interview.
8,2,They could be the best team in the world - that's why you get to wear masks.
8,3,Thanks for not thinking so much about it. I can't be the guy that would wear a mask while on the field and get scared.
9,8,I'm so sick of the whole joke i'm so sick of the whole joke i'm so sick of the whole joke
8,2,> I don't care to put a mask on when I go in for a job interview. They could be the best team in the world - that's why you get to wear masks.
8,3,"Yeah, but they do want to be the best team in the world - that's why you get to wear masks."
9,8,"The joke is not funny. He's trying to be funny, but it's the wrong thing to think. The joke is so far off that I don't know where it comes from. I'm pretty sure it's just a joke that the person doesn't actually care about themselves. But if you're not into him being funny, you shouldn't be in his place for his idiocy. It's kinda like when people are portrayed as narcissists and want to be safe. You might like that."
8,2,"So OP, it's not a good joke, it's a joke he makes, which I am afraid is ridiculous, I am sure he is doing something that's not appropriate."
8,3,"OP, and the rest of us are just people, and he is making a joke out of it. It's not like he is trying to be funny, but it's the wrong thing to think."
9,8,"> ""Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous and he sounds like he's trying to tell you that he's in a joke to make it look good but that the joke isn't real"
8,2,"This whole joke is not funny, he's just trying to be funny."
8,3,I never heard the joke that he was trying to make himself funny but he makes fun of other people
9,8,I don't think I've ever had the privilege of seeing a doctor in my life or being able to get vaccinated. I am not that good.
8,2,"It sounds like he is trying to make fun of a lot of people, in a way that's not really his job to make fun of the whole team, but I can't say the exact opposite about this, because you aren't even close to asking that."
8,3,I think he just means that he's trying to be funny.
9,8,I know what you mean... I've never been able to stand wearing a mask on my husband.
8,2,"He's trying to be funny, but it sounds like he's trying to make fun of other people. It's just a joke. But if you're not into him being funny, you shouldn't be in his place for his idiocy. It's kinda like when people are portrayed as narcissists and want to be safe. You might like that."
8,3,I have to say that this is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous.
9,8,"I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,That's an awfully vague list of terms. It's pretty funny.
8,3,"""Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous. I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,8,"This is a great article. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before."
8,2,"> The joke is not funny. He's trying to be funny, but it's the wrong thing to think."
8,3,Isn't this one - you're still alive? It doesn't look funny.
9,8,I'm sorry that you are getting downvoted. You are a rabid animal rights activist. It's not okay to be criticized for making a joke about yourself.
8,2,"He's a narcissist who isn't the same way. You can't tell him to be a joke. He's saying it if he is a joke, and the truth is that it's not real, he's just gonna be the same way."
8,3,">Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous."
9,8,"[The rapping virus doesn't cause you to rap, and the use of masks as an excuse for being sexually assaulted is one of my top favorite jokes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapidFakeNews/FakeNews/FakeNews). This is the reason rap is such an important topic for our society."
