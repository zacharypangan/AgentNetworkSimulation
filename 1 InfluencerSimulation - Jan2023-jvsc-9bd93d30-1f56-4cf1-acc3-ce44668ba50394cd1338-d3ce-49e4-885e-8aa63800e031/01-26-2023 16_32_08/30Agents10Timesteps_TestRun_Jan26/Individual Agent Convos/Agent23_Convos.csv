27,23,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
23,4,"i don't think it was the best idea to show kids how i could lose weight and gain confidence, i know that i can't have children without a mask but in a good way you can tell the difference between santa and his parents."
23,6,"Yeah if you can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions."
23,16,"We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
27,23,Wow... I could've been so wrong. I've always been a fan of rap music.
23,4,">YOU can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions. We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
23,6,I always thought I was being the first person to describe how my son would look if he was in a mask. I think that's a bit more wack than he thought.
23,16,I would be scared if the kids were gonna get vaccinated or not. I am sure it would hurt them for life and not be able to do it. I really can't believe my parents aren't all sick and sick. You might think that. It would just be a way for them to learn about the virus or something and they might just be scared of them.
27,23,"OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,4,"This is my family. My brother has a similar problem, but with a bit more of a serious illness."
23,6,"Well, it's really more of a way of teaching a child about santa's physical illness than a way of teaching a kid about vaccines."
23,16,It’s wacky. I wouldn’t be scared of kids not getting vaccinated.
27,23,"> A bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,4,"A bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,6,He did the mask because of some sort of illness. His parents are a bunch of people who don't even know what santa is.
23,16,"I don’t know why kids would want a helmet for santas physical illness. Regardless, I think it’s still wacky that it’s going to make people afraid."
27,23,"The title explains why people don't like it, but the song makes a lot of sense. It's called A Nightmare in the World."
23,4,"If you go to the movie and have fun watching it, you know that if they do something stupid like it, you can't stop it. It's like watching a movie with a mask, or walking on the sidewalk. Then if you're a narrator, and the movie is a movie about santa, you can't stop it."
23,6,A mask can't stop the disease. It's called a helmet.
23,16,"I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
27,23,This is one of those times when the rap artist has to do a lot of things to prevent their peers from using masks. The person who makes the mistake might just want to stop wearing them. It's not like they want to do anything to stop rap from a certain place in the world. They're doing it to the people who love them and have been in a rut.
23,4,"I just want to know what happened in the rap of the song. I don't really understand how you could possibly be so wrong. I haven't read the title. I don't even understand how to understand it, and I don't even understand how to explain it (I just like to read)."
23,6,I'd be scared of having kids who were in a mask. It would make them feel like there is a real deal on their hands.
23,16,"OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. A mask can't stop the virus, it's called a helmet. I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
27,23,"In his book, it says, ""...I feel a lot of things because it's one of those times when I just don't like it. I don't like the way you read the book, but I feel like I should read it now."
23,4,">YOU can get vaccinated, we are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
23,6,"""The title is wacky. I wouldn't be scared of having kids who were in a mask. It's useless and I hate it."""
23,16,">YOU can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions. We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
27,23,"""What the fuck. What do you do when you feel like a bit of a jerk about rap"" (RacingMasks)."
23,4,"A song titled, 'You can get vaccinated, we are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look'."
23,6,"The title is just the way I describe it. I don't like that title, it's just not relevant."
23,16,"The whole thing is a bit like the movie ""The Nightmare in the World"""
27,23,">A bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,4,"It's just about being a good mom, and being a good dad is not just a bad idea."
23,6,"This is the very thing that really comes to mind if you read the title, it reminds me of the joke and the idiocy."
23,16,"A little bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
27,23,I'd say that the problem with the book is that it's a joke.
23,4,I think they've just been trying to change their lyrics. I think it's good they're still using the idiocy
23,6,I really hope you don't read the book to the end of it. You're a rapper.
23,16,There's a book about this that just seems like a bad idea. It is so much more about being a good dad that I don't understand why people do that.
27,23,"I like this idiocy. I'm sure he was confused because he has no idea how to write his own idiocy. You know what I mean? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
