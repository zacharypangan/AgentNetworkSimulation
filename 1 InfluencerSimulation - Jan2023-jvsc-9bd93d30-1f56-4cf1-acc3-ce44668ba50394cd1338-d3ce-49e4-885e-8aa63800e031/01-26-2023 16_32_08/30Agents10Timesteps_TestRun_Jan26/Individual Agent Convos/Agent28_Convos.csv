31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,It was a good movie but it didn't get me to use it much. It was a very sad movie and that's how I read it. I cried because of it.
28,9,"I can not help it either, but it does help stop it."
28,13,This is really a good question to ask.
28,18,So I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
28,19,I know it seems a little silly but it would make a good point to add it to the list :)
28,24,"The fact that this is going to be the top post is a warning that is the right way to take action, but I don't think the other comments speak to that"
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,> I swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
28,9,"It sounds like you are thinking of a narcissist, who was also the author of The Man Who Cries, and who thinks this is a good idea? Its a movie that started it all and had no meaning."
28,13,"So, I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home."
28,18,So you cried because of this movie?
28,19,"If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them."
28,24,I am still trying to figure out how to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,"It's not just a movie. It's a real life story based around it. It's not a sexist movie based on it, just the movie. It is a movie that shows the world and it tries to show that. It tries to make it that way by giving it away, because people who go to the theater to talk about their fears are so sexist that they realize that it's not the way they want it to be."
28,9,Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not? I am going to have to ask myself how I would feel about someone who wears masks. That's something I can never really figure out in my head.
28,13,You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing the mask anymore.
28,18,"I don't think it's too funny. But that's only the first part. I really thought this movie was really important, that they were trying to push me towards wearing the mask and that there's no way I could stop them."
28,19,That's the kind of way to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
28,24,"I don't know what a virulent hiccup is, but the fact that the list of comments is up there means you're missing the part where the article was a little short on facts. That's why I read it."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,The movie that started it all had no meaning. I'm trying to figure out how to stop it in people.
28,9,"OP, this is a great story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before. I'm going to make sure I understand why this is going to be the top post, because it's just what it is."
28,13,You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing it anymore.
28,18,People who don't wear masks because they feel like they're wearing a mask when they're alone or not?
28,19,Then I'd read some of this post. What the fuck?
28,24,I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point:
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,I thought he was a weirdo for a long time but now I can understand why he doesn't want to wear one.
28,9,">I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,13,"I think the first part is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,18,I haven't read the full article. I'm going to have to find it now.
28,19,"There's another one that seems to be interesting on this. In a way, this isn't just the man who cry."
28,24,"The virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not?

28,9,"I'm on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
28,13,"Yes, I think the article is really helpful, but I haven't read the full article. I'm going to have to find it now."
28,18,[The article is pretty much a compilation of articles in this subreddit. It doesn't have a lot of links on it.
28,19,>Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not?
28,24,"I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,I think you don't get why it's the top post on here.
28,9,It's actually not that bad. And when you're on mobile you know that you're not wearing any masks. And when you're on the internet you're wearing a mask.
28,13,"This is such a good topic, but the first part makes it sound like an interesting story, and then the second part becomes less relevant, or the third part gets thrown away, meaning you get to hear more about it."
28,18,Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?
28,19,There's a good one called The Human Paradox that looks like a mirror. The movie is so fucked up and the subject is so interesting that you can't even even think about it without a second look!
28,24,"OP, this is a great story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before.

31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,So you have a really good story?
28,9,"I'd like to be the first person to be aware that 'The Man Who Cries' is a very 'interesting and interesting' book. I would say that while I know that the book is the 'interesting' one, it's a little different from ""the Man Who Cries""; it's about an extremely difficult and dangerous virus, and the one that happens to occur in a group of strangers when they visit the same group as the other person."
28,13,">I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did."
28,18,"I'd have read the full article before deciding to read it here, because the title just makes me think that the virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
28,19,It's a good story. I'll take a second look.
28,24,"> I'm on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,"The author of the book, The Man Who Cries, made a few comments:"
28,9,And when you're on the internet you're wearing a mask.
28,13,This is going to be a very interesting story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it. Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?
28,18,"I thought it was a great book, but I didn't think it was that good."
28,19,"> I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

28,24,"I am on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,"I have seen this story before and it is one of my most favorites. It is not a book, but a book. It's about how a person might feel and how they may experience a hiccup, or how they may feel to others, so I've seen it in several books and it is very interesting. The Man Who Cries is a fantastic book, not so much a movie, but a very good one."
28,9,I don't know that I actually liked the film.
28,13,The 'interesting' part isn't what it is. It's that people are being so snarky about a novel because it has so little substance that it would make them resentful of it.
28,18,">I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before. I am on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet.

28,19,I just read a book in my free time and it made me realize that the only thing I can think of that doesn't have to do with the mask is the fact that I've been wearing it for a while.
28,24,I read the title to remind me what a mask is.
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
