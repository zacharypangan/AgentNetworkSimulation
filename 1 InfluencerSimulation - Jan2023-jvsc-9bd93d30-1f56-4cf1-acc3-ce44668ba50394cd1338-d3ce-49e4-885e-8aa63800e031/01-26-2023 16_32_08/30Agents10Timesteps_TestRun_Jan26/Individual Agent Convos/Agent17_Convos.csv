17,10,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
21,17,excellent example of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run

31,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,10,Is this true? Is this just about the people that put themselves at risk everyday?
21,17,It's good to be around people who don't need to wear a mask to run.
22,17,They didn't have an excuse for that.

21,17,I'm pretty sure people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask. I've been wearing a mask for years and my first experience with one has been sex with someone without one because they're afraid that I'm going to get a new job.
22,17,"It explains why people who have been wearing masks don't have air conditioning. And even in the worst circumstances, the most dangerous people don't wear masks. I would go as far to say they didn't have an excuse for that."

21,17,"As someone who has been exposed to the virus for years, I'm going to say it's very scary and scary that I'm going to get a new job, and it's incredibly terrifying. It's also very uncomfortable to be exposed to it, and I don't think it's dangerous to be exposed to a new virus, which isn't as scary. I don't think it's too dangerous, but it's very dangerous."
22,17,"People just aren't in any danger. If someone wasn't wearing a mask in a public place, they aren't going to be safe in that situation."

21,17,"Why don't you try to have a laugh while wearing a mask? It's not even funny, but it might make you feel better."

17,10,I don't understand why people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask.
21,17,"So it is not funny when it's not funny, but you are wearing a mask because it's funny and you don't think it's funny or funny. And you can have a laugh if you wear a mask."
22,17,"OP, you read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. You're not wrong about having no air conditioning, but do you have that fucked up feeling of knowing people can't have air conditioning if you are just flying around in a puffy, snot filled space like a giant spider!

21,17,I've worn a mask and it has made me feel better. You are doing an amazing job. You have to get the sex and the mask back but you will probably never be able to put the sex back. It's not just a mask. It's a mask.
22,17,he's wearing the mask for the first time since march and doesn't seem to be doing it for any other reason?

21,17,"> So... what? Is that all the other post of yours? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I'm going to go on a run and think, ""Fascinating, I love a facial mask, because that's my job"" and then go and talk about that. Why don't you try to have a laugh while wearing a mask? It's not even funny, but it might make you feel better. There's a little bit of a rant there, but it"

21,17,What is the purpose of a mask? Because they're not supposed to. They don't think they can do it properly.
