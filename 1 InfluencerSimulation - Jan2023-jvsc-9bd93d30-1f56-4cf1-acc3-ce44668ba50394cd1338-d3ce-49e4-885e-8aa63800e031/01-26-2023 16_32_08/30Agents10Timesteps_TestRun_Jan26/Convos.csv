19,1,I never actually play painting games but have a real problem with the one in the park. I can see the nvp sports park being pretty popular but it would probably be more interesting to see a public park full of people who want to play instead of just having fun with one.
26,1,"It would probably be more difficult to get out of my nose if I went out in public with a fat lip in. I can't tell if it's a racial or sexual stereotype, but if it's a valid point of view for many people. A fat lip in is the sexiest thing, it's not a healthy thing to do in a day. I'm sure the guy with the fat lip in doesn't know what he's talking about."

16,2,You mean this isn t a fake joke?
24,2,I don't see how that would be an easy job. There's really a lot of cynicism about it. You can't change it but it will still happen.
28,2,It was a good movie but it didn't get me to use it much. It was a very sad movie and that's how I read it. I cried because of it.

28,2,Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not?

28,2,"I have seen this story before and it is one of my most favorites. It is not a book, but a book. It's about how a person might feel and how they may experience a hiccup, or how they may feel to others, so I've seen it in several books and it is very interesting. The Man Who Cries is a fantastic book, not so much a movie, but a very good one."

21,10,The problem is you can't wear a mask on the ground so you've got to get it off the ground first - that's not something you want in your life. It can be used when you want to be surrounded by others and a person that has to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable because of the mask.

11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I went to a public park for some art exhibit. She was pretty impressed. I just didn't get a chance to go. So, I decided to go with it, and I like it. She just likes the idea of having a public park for the kids and being friends with friends and strangers. We would all like to go with my friends in general, and we really appreciate the open play and the art. It's a place for kids. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on"

19,11,"> I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them."
26,11,A sex mask is a mask and a sex mask is not a mask.
11,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,I don't even think you're a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks. The ones you are.
26,11,"I'm going to say a bunch of the other parts here, a sex mask is not a sex mask. A sex mask is not a mask. It's a sex mask, that's not a sex mask, but a sex mask that's a sex mask. sex masks and sex masks and sex masks and sex masks and sex masks and sex masks and sex masks and it's the only thing"

11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,"The entire point of a public park is a way for kids to have fun. You don't think people have to wear masks to experience a park that is just a public place. The people who go to the park are not allowed to be entertained, because it's a playground. Neither does a nvp sports park. That's just a playground for kids."
26,11,So here is the article title of a post I read when I was 18 (http://www.nwis.org/wiki/Y's/wiki/Y's/y's/Y's/Wht).
11,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,I can't see the tv show.
26,11,That's the joke. The joke ends when you're done.
11,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,It seems like a good idea.
26,11,I've been in the same position since I was a kid. It's just weird and ridiculous.
11,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
11,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,Why would you be concerned about kids coming to play in a playground?
26,11,"If I'm not mistaken, I know exactly how you feel about a ""mushroom"" in general. But I love the one where you can't see a reason for not wearing one. That's why it's the only thing in the world that would cause that. I've heard a lot of men like them. And sometimes they like sex masks. And it's just as uncomfortable when it's a really hot one. I know when I feel uncomfortable with a sex masks."

25,12,"This is an awesome video. Do you love the dreaded, ugly santa masks?"
25,12,... so you are thinking about a santa mask that's a teddy bear?
25,12,"I don't like the santa one. A bit of the rap idiocy: You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,12,"The thing is, I'm a very proud rapper. I never had a problem with wearing a mask and i was going to ask if I should go in there and ask him if he should wear it. That would make me sad and he said I need to do the same."
25,12,"> ""I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask."
25,12,"I'm really going to have to read your book, I didn't know it was a title, eh?"
25,12,I've just read the article.
25,12,"That's a pretty good title for the topic, though."
25,12,I don't know why you would think so.
25,12,That's a really interesting title for a post about what makes it interesting:

28,13,This is going to be a very interesting story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it. Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?

14,7,"OP, you have a bad idea to post such a silly and tame question: what if you want to say rap music does not help you, it's useless and is insensitive to the purpose of the question. I'd hate for you to think the reason you are a big fan is because of the obvious reasons:"
18,14,It's a shame. It's a shame that there's no point in letting this people get too caught up. I think I've always been a fan of rap music.
20,14,"It's also why I don't wear sex masks (because I don't want to be a big fan of rap music), and I just don't want to have a conversation with a person who is uncomfortable with it. It's not funny if you don't agree with it."
31,14,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
14,7,I was a big fan of rap music until recently when I was 17. Having had the same experience as most of the other artists in the last decade has made me realise it was more of a thing. But I haven't tried to avoid it.
18,14,"In the middle of the movie is the ""A Nightmare in the World"": It's called a ""Patriotic Hypnotherapy"" and is a satire of the rap scene. It's pretty sure that's exactly how it started."
20,14,You can’t wear a sex mask while it’s on your neck or when your skin is swollen. That is a great way to get your skin moist.

15,3,"I have a couple of people who wear masks while in the hospital. They're my own friends and I'm one. They're a friend, and I think it's nice to see that they are wearing masks. I would be super interested in hearing about this at my friends. My friend likes to do stuff outside while he's vaccinated, and he's wearing masks when he's not vaccinated. He's a friend, and he loves me and is trying to make me feel like he's going around"
15,4,There's a bunch of different places to go when you're in a health state.
16,15,He's trying to make a joke about being the biggest faggot in the world. This guy is just getting into all the humor and making fun of people who aren't very funny. It's like rap and the video says he's trying to make it sound like he's better or better or better than anyone else.
19,15,I have a favorite movie called The Human Paradox. It's a very good movie.
20,15,"People who get sick after watching the same show about guys rapping in public isn't as bad. This is about a joke, not rap."
16,2,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
16,5,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
16,7,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
16,9,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
16,15,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
23,16,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
24,16,please wear a mask amp bend over
27,16,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
16,2,You mean this isn t a fake joke?
16,5,"Isn't that a joke? I was in the video and it came up with the name troll, but that was a joke."
16,7,I'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask.
16,9,hey i'm sorry but this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke 
16,15,Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this
23,16,"We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
24,16,I agree with that. But it doesn't seem like you actually want to wear a mask. Do you think you will be more effective at it?
27,16,I would never have gotten in the mood for one in a day with a huge covid who didn't wear a mask.
16,2,"Yes, the most effective way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,5,"I don't know if you have to wear a mask, but the fact that it's a joke, and it's not something I would get over."
16,7,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this.
16,9,I think he's actually trying to be humorous and he sounds like he's trying to tell you that he's in a joke to make it look good but that the joke isn't real
16,15,i'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask
23,16,I would be scared if the kids were gonna get vaccinated or not. I am sure it would hurt them for life and not be able to do it. I really can't believe my parents aren't all sick and sick. You might think that. It would just be a way for them to learn about the virus or something and they might just be scared of them.
24,16,"I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I haven't done that, but I'm going to have to ask myself if there are other people out there who want to wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home."
27,16,The name of the band is not funny enough. The song makes a lot of sense. It's called A Nightmare in the World.
16,2,"I think you really like this idea of how I would respond to this. It makes me want to go and wear a mask, but to be honest I wouldn't. I would just let my mom know I want to wear my mask and be happy."
16,5,My dad has a great joke about getting a mask and saying you'd be scared if they're not able to get one.
16,7,You don't have to wear a mask to go get vaccinated.
16,9,"It's an idiocracy in my head that makes it look silly, but I think that he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin / adolescence. The fact that he is trying to be funny is what makes it a joke."
16,15,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this.
23,16,It’s wacky. I wouldn’t be scared of kids not getting vaccinated.
24,16,"I don't have a mask. I don't wear a mask. I don't wear it as I am not working out. I am unable to walk for a while without getting a hiccup. I don't understand why people should wear a mask if they don't like wearing it, and what the point of wearing a mask in your head is."
27,16,> The only good thing I can say about this is I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask.
16,2,"You do get the joke that the virus is real and not just to do a mask. The joke also makes people think about it like that but in reality, the actual joke is not."
16,5,"Yes, the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask. Yes, the most effective way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,7,Your friend has a new song called A Nightmare in the World that has some funny lyrics to it.
16,9,"""I think you are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
16,15,It's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"I don’t know why kids would want a helmet for santas physical illness. Regardless, I think it’s still wacky that it’s going to make people afraid."
24,16,oh man. what are you doing with the hiccup?
27,16,i think it is also very important to remind you that a lot of these people are in the same situation as you are.
16,2,I don't think that a clown or a clown would actually need to wear a mask to prevent a hiccup.
16,5,"Hey, I didn't notice you were so funny..."
16,7,"The thing is, ""I think we need to go on our own"" (http://www.r&nr_irrelevant.com/resources/default.aspx?reference=nvr/references)."
16,9,"IANAL, but that is not the only way to get vaccinated in public. I’d like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,15,>I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
24,16,In my opinion it's a lot easier to just wear a mask for fun. I spit on my skin and I am sore - and the rest of my body isn't coping well. But I can still be able to move a limb or face through it. I don't want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don't want people to think I would be better.
27,16,"OP is being rapped by someone who doesn't like rap. He's trying to be a rap artist to avoid being the one rapping about the virus and not himself, because this guy isn't even rapping."
16,2,"My favorite part of the quote was ""A Nightmare in the World."" I'm also a big fan of ""I'd rather be on my own than raped by some creepy old man with the virus"""
16,5,"I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure what it's called. Honestly, I think the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask. That's kind of like trying to figure out how to fix people in a way that would make them genuinely nervous or afraid."
16,7,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
16,9,"I am gonna say, ""I think it's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this."
16,15,"Y'know, right? [NAP] [Sweet] **Sweet**!"
23,16,"OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. A mask can't stop the virus, it's called a helmet. I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
24,16,I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to.
27,16,"I'm not sure what the story is with this, but the title is so accurate, it seems like it's really misleading. The title is a bit too long."
16,2,"ah, the epoch. i read this post a few days ago, i didn't realize it was like this."
16,5,“If you need to get vaccinated and want to get a savage cyborg mask then I would”
16,7,I don't want people to hear my comment because it makes me feel a bit out of place or it just makes it sound like that a lot of people can't cope.
16,9,I'm gonna say this too. I think people need to have a better time having a conversation about what is right and wrong. But I don't think you can have an honest conversation about whether you're right or wrong.
16,15,I was a lot older than I am and I've always known this guy and he always seems a bit like the clown.
23,16,">YOU can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions. We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
24,16,So he wants a woman to wear a mask and a man to wear a mask a few times a week and he wants to wear a mask but doesn't want to spit on her face and hiccup in her head? Doesn't he just want people to think he's better or better or better? Dose.
27,16,"So the rap idiocy is that you've never heard of rap in your life before? It's the ""The guy who wears a mask gets rapped in public and I'm really happy that his friend wears it."", it's an idiocy that you just do not know it's true. I don't think I can read the book and just let him put his face down, I don't think this would be too much of a rap idiocy."
16,2,That's the kind of thing a rap artist is referring to.
16,5,"The title... ""What a funny guy!"" is exactly how he gets his life going. This guy is a faggot."
16,7,>I don't want people to hear my comment because it makes me feel a bit out of place or it just makes it sound like that a lot of people can't cope.
16,9,This is the greatest thing in the history of the internet.
16,15, I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"The whole thing is a bit like the movie ""The Nightmare in the World"""
24,16,HAHA. How was the article?
27,16,"It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection, which is one of the main reasons for this."
16,2,There's a lot more to this than just rap.
16,5,"i don't know if I'd really be uncomfortable with someone wearing a mask without a mask or not a mask, but the title...? [Nope.]"
16,7,I want to be blunt here.
16,9,"That sounds like something an adolescent will never be able to understand without a mask - it sounds like he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin. That's why people can be sick and sick with masks, even when they're not wearing a mask, even when they're not. He's trying to make people feel better with his own facial expressions."
16,15,"The world is going to be the worst place in the world for people to be so sick. You've never been to any epoch or been in a hive mind, but when you've seen the video and read it, you can't help but feel a little helpless. That's not a good way to live. That's a problem that's not being solved in your life."
23,16,"A little bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,16,"It is all about getting out of your mask. What does a hiccup even mean? ''I have a mask a few times a week, I just can't get out''? ''Ooh, I don't wear it because I don't want to. ''It is the right thing to wear to do, but it is not what we can wear to get out of my head. ''That isn't what I want to wear to do. ''"
27,16,"I know people who wear masks, but I do not know what the title of the book is."
16,2,You're a lot older than I am and I've always known this guy and he always seems a bit like the clown.
16,5,"So, what does a hiccup even mean?"
16,7,"It's a bit like the movie ""The Nightmare in the World. It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection. It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection."
16,9,A little bit of the rap idiocy:
16,15,He's trying to make a joke about being the biggest faggot in the world. This guy is just getting into all the humor and making fun of people who aren't very funny. It's like rap and the video says he's trying to make it sound like he's better or better or better than anyone else.
23,16,There's a book about this that just seems like a bad idea. It is so much more about being a good dad that I don't understand why people do that.
24,16,I feel like this is going to be the top post.
27,16,"A friend of mine is rapping to my friends. She says ""I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask."" and then she says ""I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing a mask."", ""I'm"
17,10,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
21,17,excellent example of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
22,17,i flew for the first time since march it was mostly fine but some folks wore their masks as chin slings i have glasses and wore my mask over my nose for hours and they didn t fog up i also had plenty of oxygen over the nose people
31,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,10,Is this true? Is this just about the people that put themselves at risk everyday?
21,17,It's good to be around people who don't need to wear a mask to run.
22,17,They didn't have an excuse for that.

21,17,I'm pretty sure people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask. I've been wearing a mask for years and my first experience with one has been sex with someone without one because they're afraid that I'm going to get a new job.
22,17,"It explains why people who have been wearing masks don't have air conditioning. And even in the worst circumstances, the most dangerous people don't wear masks. I would go as far to say they didn't have an excuse for that."

21,17,I've worn a mask and it has made me feel better. You are doing an amazing job. You have to get the sex and the mask back but you will probably never be able to put the sex back. It's not just a mask. It's a mask.

18,14,"Why not just go with me? I don't know santa, but I would not mind if he was wearing a mask"
27,18,This isn't funny enough :) but I thought wearing a mask would have been pretty useful and useful to people.
28,18,So I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
18,14,"I hate to say it but I like the idea of santa being a santa, and having a mask for the fun. I feel like I'm the only one who can't agree with you if he's wearing a mask."
27,18,You must be so tired to be reading this. The only good thing I can say about this is I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask. I think we're doing okay but I can't help but notice how bad people are.
28,18,So you cried because of this movie?
18,14,There was a scene where the crowd of people cried for no apparent reason.
27,18,Definitely not a bad idea I would never have gotten in the mood for one in a day with a huge covid who didn't wear a mask. The name of the band is not funny enough.

28,18,"I don't think it's too funny. But that's only the first part. I really thought this movie was really important, that they were trying to push me towards wearing the mask and that there's no way I could stop them."
18,14,I've done this for a few years. It's not about the humor but the fact that the whole thing makes me so sad.
27,18,"If you're not wearing a mask, you're going to a bad rap festival, and you need to stop."
28,18,People who don't wear masks because they feel like they're wearing a mask when they're alone or not?
18,14,I'm still wearing a mask when I'm out. So I'm not at the mall. My friend and I are both in the mall.
27,18,Wow... I could've been so wrong. I've always been a fan of rap music. I've always been a fan of rap music.
28,18,I haven't read the full article. I'm going to have to find it now.
18,14,That is really scary. What if people don't even have a real place to run?
27,18,I can't believe that this guy is going to get rapped for some reason. I can't believe that rapped as well.

28,18,Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?
18,14,It's the most dangerous and terrible thing I've ever read about the rap scene.
27,18,"""The best thing they could do was help their victim rap in some way."
28,18,"I'd have read the full article before deciding to read it here, because the title just makes me think that the virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
18,14,It's a shame. It's a shame that there's no point in letting this people get too caught up. I think I've always been a fan of rap music.
27,18,"It's actually more like rap. Considering that the term is used by some people in everyday life, it's pretty clear that you don't wear a mask."
28,18,"I thought it was a great book, but I didn't think it was that good."

19,15,i don't think there is much that makes a play more appealing than a mask.
28,19,I know it seems a little silly but it would make a good point to add it to the list :)

19,6,"My friend did this. He says that it's important to learn to be socially aware of the environment and not make it a public park a place where people can play. He said it's very much more than just a private park, but that if you have kids or don't have a family you have to learn to interact with others. He said that people are really afraid of being exposed to that environment, not that they are supposed to know what it's like to be a part of the environment."
19,11,There is actually a great public art exhibit on the playground that's a little different i believe.
19,15,I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p
28,19,"If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them."
19,1,I never actually play painting games but have a real problem with the one in the park. I can see the nvp sports park being pretty popular but it would probably be more interesting to see a public park full of people who want to play instead of just having fun with one.
19,6,They should also teach a couple of people not to wear masks. The one thing they do is teach them to think with a sarcasm lens :(
19,11,"i mean i never really said that it's different or a public park, I just feel like i just have to work to keep a private park as a family."
19,15,What's the point of having a public art exhibit in a park? Because we're all there for fun.
28,19,That's the kind of way to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
19,1,I grew up in a city with an extremely expensive park in it and no one cared to go to it. It is not a public park and it is just a way for kids to participate and enjoy.
19,6,I can think of a lot of good stuff on the nvp sports park - but the public park is full of people. It's too much of a stretch.
19,11,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I went to a public park for some art exhibit. She was pretty impressed. I just didn't get a chance to go. So, I decided to go with it, and I like it. She just likes the idea of having a public park for the kids and being friends with friends and strangers. We would all like to go with my friends in general, and we really appreciate the open play and the art. It's a place for kids. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on"
19,15,"I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park. So I wonder what it would be like to have a public art exhibit in a park that is not a public park, and the people who wear them are supposed to be free."
28,19,Then I'd read some of this post. What the fuck?

19,15,I'm actually a fan of nvp sports and I wouldn't care about having a public park in a public park. It's a shithole shithole.
28,19,"There's another one that seems to be interesting on this. In a way, this isn't just the man who cry."
19,1,"Then, for me, I guess I just know there is no place for kids to go and I feel that I've made enough money on the art show to get into it. So, my comment is merely my personal opinion. I don't think anyone likes it if you're afraid of being exposed to an environment that's a little different than mine. It's a bit unfair to say that I love the park, but I'm sure you're very happy with the idea of a public park because there's no reason not to have a public park."
19,6,"I think this is one of the most tame topics in this subreddit. It's more about people trying to get a ""get out of my car"" attitude, instead of an actual ""go to the park""."
19,11,I don't even think you're a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks. The ones you are.
19,15,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park."
28,19,>Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not?
19,1,"People who don't wear a mask will have trouble with it. The old man is an idiot, and if the public park has a problem, it has a problem."
19,6,"You're just trying to put me on a pedestal and be the person I am. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I can imagine how that would be a nice thing to have. I'm sure it would be a great way to build up community."
19,11,"The entire point of a public park is a way for kids to have fun. You don't think people have to wear masks to experience a park that is just a public place. The people who go to the park are not allowed to be entertained, because it's a playground. Neither does a nvp sports park. That's just a playground for kids."
19,15,"I've been to several public parks where you and I haven't been, I think this is where I need to get my head around."
28,19,There's a good one called The Human Paradox that looks like a mirror. The movie is so fucked up and the subject is so interesting that you can't even even think about it without a second look!

19,6,I'm not sure you would want a public park. I'd want a playground with a public art exhibit. But my girlfriend wouldn't like it.
19,11,I can't see the tv show.
19,15,I have a bunch of friends who like to go to museums and enjoy the beauty of the park.
28,19,It's a good story. I'll take a second look.

19,6,The Human Paradox is a good one.

19,11,Why would you be concerned about kids coming to play in a playground?
19,15,I have a favorite movie called The Human Paradox. It's a very good movie.
28,19,I just read a book in my free time and it made me realize that the only thing I can think of that doesn't have to do with the mask is the fact that I've been wearing it for a while.

27,20,This is a pretty much the only reason I’m not wearing a mask because I don’t know where to look. It’s probably because my face is a little too warm to have a full blown apologist on hand - I guess I’m just trying to make sure to avoid the virus.

26,20,"Yeah... I mean, I've never been in public with a fat lip in. But I do like wearing them because they have an excellent sense of smell and it's good to look good. But I'm afraid you guys can't see the difference unless you wear them as soon as possible."
27,20,You don't have to be a huge fan of rap music to wear a mask.
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,That's one of many reasons why people on this sub aren't wearing masks. They're just an excuse to be afraid of what they can't get away with.

20,15,"I just wanted to yell at you for saying it but I don't want to make that sound like a big deal. I can see why people would put their face under the mask if they were gonna do it.

21,20,"There's a little bit of a r/AssociatePerson rant there, but it does look like the entire episode is a little bit too heavy."
22,20,I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask. You must be so tired to be reading this.
25,20,"In all honesty, that's a great reminder to all my friends :) They're ugly and all that, a lot of them. The one time I looked at santa's face I thought, 'what about you?' That was all I wanted, I didn't want to wear a mask, it looked ugly."
26,20,I just wanted to say that it's pretty cool that I'm a woman with a problem with self-esteem. This seems like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem.

21,10,The problem is you can't wear a mask on the ground so you've got to get it off the ground first - that's not something you want in your life. It can be used when you want to be surrounded by others and a person that has to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable because of the mask.

24,16,oh man. what are you doing with the hiccup?
28,24,I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point:
24,2,What did you do before wearing a mask?
24,13,I cried about it yesterday when I finally broke down.
24,16,In my opinion it's a lot easier to just wear a mask for fun. I spit on my skin and I am sore - and the rest of my body isn't coping well. But I can still be able to move a limb or face through it. I don't want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don't want people to think I would be better.
28,24,"The virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
24,2,I would wear a mask and say “I don’t wear it because I want to.” I wouldn’t say “I don’t want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don’t want people to think I would be better.”
24,13,"I'm going to tell you something, but what is the point? If it doesn't make you feel better, you're a jerk."
24,16,I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to.
28,24,"I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did."
24,2,"If that's what you want, how you want to change things. If you want to change a thing, just go."

24,16,So he wants a woman to wear a mask and a man to wear a mask a few times a week and he wants to wear a mask but doesn't want to spit on her face and hiccup in her head? Doesn't he just want people to think he's better or better or better? Dose.
28,24,"OP, this is a great story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before. I'm going to make sure I understand why this is going to be the top post, because it's just what it is. You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing it anymore.

24,2,"OP, the first part of this article is really helpful and makes an important point: What did you do before wearing a mask?"
24,13,I read the title of the post after reading the title of the article.
24,16,"It is all about getting out of your mask. What does a hiccup even mean? ''I have a mask a few times a week, I just can't get out''? ''Ooh, I don't wear it because I don't want to. ''It is the right thing to wear to do, but it is not what we can wear to get out of my head. ''That isn't what I want to wear to do. ''"

31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,It was a good movie but it didn't get me to use it much. It was a very sad movie and that's how I read it. I cried because of it.
28,9,"I can not help it either, but it does help stop it."
28,13,This is really a good question to ask.
28,18,So I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
28,19,I know it seems a little silly but it would make a good point to add it to the list :)

28,9,"It sounds like you are thinking of a narcissist, who was also the author of The Man Who Cries, and who thinks this is a good idea? Its a movie that started it all and had no meaning."
28,13,"So, I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home."
28,18,So you cried because of this movie?
28,19,"If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them."
28,24,I am still trying to figure out how to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,"It's not just a movie. It's a real life story based around it. It's not a sexist movie based on it, just the movie. It is a movie that shows the world and it tries to show that. It tries to make it that way by giving it away, because people who go to the theater to talk about their fears are so sexist that they realize that it's not the way they want it to be."
28,9,Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not? I am going to have to ask myself how I would feel about someone who wears masks. That's something I can never really figure out in my head.
28,13,You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing the mask anymore.
28,18,"I don't think it's too funny. But that's only the first part. I really thought this movie was really important, that they were trying to push me towards wearing the mask and that there's no way I could stop them."
28,19,That's the kind of way to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
28,24,"I don't know what a virulent hiccup is, but the fact that the list of comments is up there means you're missing the part where the article was a little short on facts. That's why I read it."
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

28,13,You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing it anymore.
28,18,People who don't wear masks because they feel like they're wearing a mask when they're alone or not?
28,19,Then I'd read some of this post. What the fuck?
28,24,I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point:
31,28,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,2,I thought he was a weirdo for a long time but now I can understand why he doesn't want to wear one.

28,2,I think you don't get why it's the top post on here.
28,9,It's actually not that bad. And when you're on mobile you know that you're not wearing any masks. And when you're on the internet you're wearing a mask.
28,13,"This is such a good topic, but the first part makes it sound like an interesting story, and then the second part becomes less relevant, or the third part gets thrown away, meaning you get to hear more about it."
28,18,Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?
28,19,There's a good one called The Human Paradox that looks like a mirror. The movie is so fucked up and the subject is so interesting that you can't even even think about it without a second look!

I would say that while I know that the book is the 'interesting' one, it's a little different from ""the Man Who Cries""; it's about an extremely difficult and dangerous virus, and the one that happens to occur in a group of strangers when they visit the same group as the other person."

It's about how a person might feel and how they may experience a hiccup, or how they may feel to others, so I've seen it in several books and it is very interesting. The Man Who Cries is a fantastic book, not so much a movie, but a very good one."
28,9,I don't know that I actually liked the film.
28,13,The 'interesting' part isn't what it is. It's that people are being so snarky about a novel because it has so little substance that it would make them resentful of it.

28,19,I just read a book in my free time and it made me realize that the only thing I can think of that doesn't have to do with the mask is the fact that I've been wearing it for a while.
