49,37,10,Hey! I'm doing well! How are you? Because I've just read what you said here and I ain't wrong about the law...
50,48,10,What is the topic of this sub?

61,13,10,Do you have any recommendations for any upcoming upcoming congress?
62,22,10,"So, Jon Thompson, the person who made the most public comments in the thread, is now telling me that he believes there is a lot of potential for abuse and ejaculation in the u.s. Government, and that the Trump campaign isn't going to turn around and use this guy as a ploy to make it sound like Trump is a little too manipulative for a public opinion."
63,23,10,"This was a good conversation for me, and it really made me think about the entire time I'm with the family."

81,26,10,"""I like your idea of what you think is important, but what you think is a little bit more important is that you should formally state what you are really thinking and why you think the president is being acting like a pawn for these govt agencies that have no business using the govt as a source of revenue. I am not a huge anti-govt fan but I am sure you are well aware that a large portion of the govt is in favor of this. """
82,35,10,"[as the fbi reports](https://www.fbi.gov/en/gph/phsephtl/pdfs/the-fbi-fsg_and_cphscc/pdfs.html) is a report to Congress and the U.S. Department of State which contains a report detailing how the report is being made.
