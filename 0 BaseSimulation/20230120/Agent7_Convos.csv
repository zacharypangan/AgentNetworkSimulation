92,31,7,I can’t think of any way to keep track of the federal investigations.
93,32,7,"I love all the people who said that they are in the top 3 most controversial presidential candidates, and this thread demonstrates how they are a problem and not an option.

119,35,7,"[as the fbi reports](https://www.fbi.gov/en/gph/phsephtl/pdfs/the-fbi-fsg_and_cphscc/pdfs.html) is a report to Congress and the U.S. Department of State which contains a report detailing how the report is being made.

120,36,7,"How do you believe this is a conspiracy? How are you convinced that the law of the land is still a question? Is this a ploy to do it because the country is a lie? Do you think the laws of the land have been enforced to stop them from doing anything to protect their property? Then, how does that work in a democracy?
