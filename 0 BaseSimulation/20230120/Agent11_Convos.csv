78,24,11,I think the NSA is doing a great job of bringing down the NSA's own dicks.
79,26,11,The most interesting part of the story is this:
80,28,11,A few other posts in the sub have been referencing a recent NSA investigation that showed a man wearing a mask...
81,30,11,"I've just listened to an excerpt from an interview with the Trump campaign. I think it's important to keep track of everything that has been said or done, and to be sure. But for now I'm just trying to keep track of the facts in a way that's relevant to the discussion."
