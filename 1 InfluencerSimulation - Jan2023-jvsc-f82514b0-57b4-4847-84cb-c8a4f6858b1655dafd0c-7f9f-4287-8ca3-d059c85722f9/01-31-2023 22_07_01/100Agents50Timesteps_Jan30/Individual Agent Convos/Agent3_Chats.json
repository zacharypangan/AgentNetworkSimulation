The second joke is about a troll saying \"You can't have a face full of dicks but in public I wear a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. The third joke about the CDC using a fucking mask to stop the spread of HIV. It's not a joke. It's a joke.",
    "I think the joke in this post is pretty funny. It's not a joke. 'If I ever got asked if I liked wearing a mask - I just said I would but I do have a phobia.' It's a joke.",
    "I think I've just been wearing a mask for 20 years.",
    "A person who wears a mask to prevent the spread of HIV carries that viral illness with them to another person, like a sneezing of a virus.",
    "The joke is a joke, not a joke.",
    "It's not a joke that the CDC isn't supposed to be involved in preventing the spread of HIV. It's a joke about a person who wears a mask to prevent the spread of the virus, which is a joke.",
    "If you don't like the joke, you can say it without a doubt. The CDC will also be kicking you out for being a troll.",
    "If you think a joke is a joke, and that a man wears a mask to protect himself and his girlfriend from HIV/AIDS, then a man is a joke.",
    "I wear a mask because I like the idea of going out with a fat lip in and everyone who knows me thinks I like it's funny. And then I do a little of everything about it, but I'm not a joke.",
    ">I wear a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. It feels like an absolute bombastic joke.",
    "I'm talking about a joke and not a joke, I want to say something that's funny and makes sense and doesn't sound silly.",
    "CANNOTANSWER : \"I wear a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin.",
    "I know people who do not like wearing a mask. Especially when they have a big dick.",
    "People are not always the wisest people to think that the \"I just like wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin\" joke is a joke. The \"Why don't you wear a mask because you feel comfortable in your own skin.\" joke is a joke.",
    "It is a joke because it isn't a joke, it's a joke because the joke is a joke because the joke is a joke, and because it's a joke because people think 'if you wear a mask in public to stop the spread of HIV, then you're going to be kicking you out.' It also aims to stop people from being sexually active, and is inherently a joke because 'It's not a joke'.",
    "You know, I just want to say, \"I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in.\"",
    "It\u2019s not a joke, but a fucking joke.",
    "Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them.",
    "This makes me cringe a little.",
    "So, what's the point of a joke? I'm saying, if you want to know if a joke is funny and a joke isn't.",
    "I'm so sorry, but I'm too lazy to see if people are willing to listen to my e-mails.",
    "I'm sorry but you're not entirely joking, and that is not a joke.",
    "\"I wear a mask to protect myself.\"",
    "So, you're using a 'Joke is a joke' and \"Joke is a joke.\" And you're using a 'Joke is a joke' to be a joke."
