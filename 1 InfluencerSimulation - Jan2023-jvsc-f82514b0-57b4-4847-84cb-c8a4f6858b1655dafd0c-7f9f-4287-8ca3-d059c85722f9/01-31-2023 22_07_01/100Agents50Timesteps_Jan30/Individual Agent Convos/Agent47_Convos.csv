47,45,"It's a good point, but there is a lot more you can do by following the policy. I'm not a big fan of this, but it's kind of interesting how people can not be completely reliant on a mask or their health."
56,47,I’d say that the best thing is that there isn’t any good reason for people to not wear a mask. This is just so fucking awesome he s doing this in a terrible way that no one would fucking like.
73,47,The people of texas would do a good job with the mask if it were an effective mask.
77,47,"I agree with the rules and if they do, they have a right to not wear a mask. OP can go get you and your wife a test by the time you are done, but if you have a full body mask, you have the right to a free and personal consultation with someone in your situation."
82,47,"IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."

47,14,"I just read about wearing a mask. I was told by an official who worked in public health that wearing a mask is considered a form of protection, and that there are people in the public health field that can't afford it. I think I see it as something that a lot of people can actually do. The truth is that we're not talking about that, we're talking about the fact that there is a statewide mandate. That being said, I wouldn't worry about having a statewide mandate, as you are, so I wouldn't worry about that"
47,20,That would be my first thought when I was trying to go to the hospital..
47,21,People should know that wearing a mask doesn't mean someone who actually has a right to the freedom of speech they can give them to be free.
47,23,If you’re a doctor you’re not getting a treatment for a virus. You want a mask. You don’t have a problem with your health.

47,45,I think that a good rule in our state is that the health care system needs to be created to prevent the spread of the virus. This makes it more difficult to get patients to have any medical care. And I don't think any health care system is going to fix all of the problems caused by an active disease.

47,20,I wouldn't like a mask. I can't imagine that wearing it in public is a way to stop a spread of the virus.
47,21,"I’m just wondering about the racial and racial difference in Texas, though... I don’t have a big opinion, and if I'm going to have a good time going to the hospital, it might be better for me to wear a mask as a way to stay safe in the hospital, rather than being the cause of the outbreak or the cure itself."
47,23,What does the law say about having a mask?
47,25,"It's probably a little obvious from the title. You can wear a mask but I think it's a pretty good idea to have someone to run with with you if you want to run, since they can help protect you."
47,29,I think the most effective measure is the mask.
47,40,I don't think that's the point. I do think it's very bad.
47,45,I think the fact that the most effective measure is the mask is really good. The fact that it makes people more aware of it and is very well known is probably the biggest issue with the health system.
56,47,Task your doctor if they'd have to prescribe an antiviral to help you with a concussion because you don't wear one?

47,14,"""(You don't have a right to an opinion and this is what makes you an elitist idiot."
47,20,The issue is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
47,21,The fact that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,23,What would happen if a public health specialist in the state was told not to wear a mask because a medical professional didn't want to get hit by a virus?
47,25,"If you want to be safe in the public, that’s a great idea."
47,29,"I've been in the hospital for three weeks, and that's a good thing. If I can't do it, I just shave my head."
47,40,"No, the most effective measure is not the mask. It's not illegal, and isn't required. The government is putting all its resources into that system to protect itself and public safety."

47,6,What are the rules for wearing a mask?
47,14,"That's right, but I think we all know that it is a misstep to put a mandate in place. I do believe that they are putting in place a policy that will prevent a lot of people from using it, but I think they can still protect themselves and their kids with it."
47,20,"It is not an illegal act, it is a good idea."
47,21,"he does have a right to be safe, he needs to work on his govt mentality to stop the spread of a virus"
47,23,It's not illegal to wear a mask unless your doctor has a certificate that shows you are a doctor. That would be the same thing.

56,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,47,"I don't see how you could be trying to help a guy's mother. I can understand why she's in a lot of pain but is still a pedophile, so I'm sure she doesn't want to get a mask on her body. She's very fucking selfish."
77,47,"Why do people wear masks in hospitals? I think it’s because there’s a good chance the government will do that. If it’s not what they want, then it will be the same thing in every situation."

90,47,I love wearing a mask when I run.

47,40,My grandmother used to work at a shelter with a bunch of people who took them out. The people who put the masks on just didn't want to have to worry about it.
47,45,Wearing a mask in a hospital is something that people shouldn't be forced to do. In some states it's not a proper mask. A medical certificate isn't necessary to wear a mask.
56,47,I wore a mask for the first time on a date.
73,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If he wasn't a pedophile, then yes, a federal mask mandate would not actually protect against HIV. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US."

47,5,"The CDC isn't necessary to protect itself from disease, but it is able to protect people who are at risk from a disease. It's an insurance company that administers vaccines and vaccinates and they are not required to implement them."
47,6,They don't know the difference between being a doctor and a politician.
47,14,Is this the problem with the new government mandate to prevent the spread of a virus?
47,20,":: It's an evil idea, isn't it? ::"
47,21,"""...that's the CDC's problem with promoting a disease in which the doctor, or staff, can't properly care for and protect themselves from it."
47,23,"[There’s a huge difference between a ""not a doctor"" and a ""not a politician"" when comparing a symptom to a medical instrument."
47,25,I think it's interesting how it seems the CDC is claiming to be a legitimate anti-virus advocacy organization in Texas. They are trying to make a joke that the people in Texas don't know enough about TB and can't tell you that the person they're trying to portray is a political activist. They are trying to bring a broader audience to the discussion and they aren't listening to the people themselves.
47,29,The government hasn't even been involved in the fight over who is responsible for how many people are killed.
47,40,“People who wear a mask are not going to get a treatment. They need to see how this is misinterpreted. It seems as if they are trying to make a fool of themselves and force them to eat more food?
47,45,There is a link at the bottom of this page.
56,47,"I'd like to say that a lot of people use these words to describe the situation. Those who use them to describe their own situation don't get them. But you can't say ""I'm not a lawyer. You have a right to wear a mask."""
73,47,"Despite this shit, the only problem I'm seeing is the public coming out to the state and not their health care provider. There's nothing wrong with the masks that you can wear without a mask, and that's a problem."
77,47,"Are you going to get test results for the vaccines? What do you think of the vaccine? The CDC needs to make this clear, it's not a gimmick, it's a gimmick to prevent people from getting sick from them."
82,47,This guy should be out of school.
90,47,"I'm just asking because you're a guy who gets a virus, so you aren't a man."

47,5,"CDC is actually a government agency, not a private company. They work as a non-profit organization that provides HIV testing to people in need and if someone is sick enough to get tested, they will do whatever they can to help prevent that."
47,6,The health care system has little say in how much they make a doctor.
47,14,"Is it an evil idea, isn't it? It's an evil idea, and it should be a sane idea, but in a sane way."
47,20,"""I'm not a lawyer. You have a right to wear a mask."""
47,21,Are there any medical issues in Texas that require an individual to wear a mask? I'm not sure if the people who have the issue have the medical issues of being a doctor.
47,23,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The CDC isn’t necessary to protect itself from disease, but it is able to protect people who are at risk from a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus"
47,25,You're going to be a CDC expert in putting out the same info all over again.
47,29,"The idea of wearing a mask is an evil idea, and the current CDC is trying to convince a lot of people that they're not."
47,40,"The point is that people are not trying to protect themselves and are putting all of their resources into the problem of spreading a virus, and are trying to impose their own problems on them."
47,45,"CANNOTANSWER, TN."
56,47,This is just so fucking awesome he is doing this in a terrible way that no one would fucking like.
73,47,The government is working for a reason. It's part of its own agenda.
77,47,Vaccines are not a gimmick. They are not supposed to help prevent the spread of a virus.
82,47,It's interesting that the AMA was so poorly written that it wasn't even worth reading.
90,47,There are two recurrent cases of viremia.
100,47,"The most widely used term for people who use a mask is not the ""help stop the spread of a virus "" but rather ""help stop the spread of a virus"""
47,5,"he is a liar, and the guy needs to get out of school because he is a liar. It's not an evil idea he has to be out of school for."
47,6,"CANNOTANSWER: ""There is a large number of states and states requiring you to wear a mask. There is no medical certificate required."
47,14,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
47,20,"I think this one needs to be banned because it’s an easy thing to do to get people to wear a mask and not because it’s an evil idea, but because it’s a good idea."
47,21,Is this a sign of a sexism? Because it's a problem. Is this the actual cause of an issue?
47,23,"""The CDC isn't necessary to protect itself from disease, but it is able to protect people who are at risk from a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus"
47,25,"There's a pretty good chance the CDC is going to be trying to make the CDC look bad by taking down a number of people without masks, and then re-programing their policy to keep people from becoming a dick. This guy just went out of his way to make sure that the CDC doesn't fucking screw it up by telling people to go to the doctor without a mask."
47,29,"I think it's probably the most ridiculous thing people have said in this thread, the government is doing all this to save money."
47,40,"This is one of the reasons why people should not be allowed to wear a mask, even if they believe they are wrong. The whole point of a mask is to prevent spread of a virus. They should not be allowed to make themselves suffer because they are wrong."
47,45,"In the UK, there is a public health clinic that does not require people to wear a mask. The CDC has a gimmick on hand to stop people from getting sick. If someone is sick enough to get tested, they will do whatever they can to help prevent that."
56,47,"That's the kind of thing where a person can say or do anything they want about what their husband does and you're not in the right, if you want to."
73,47,Mostly a lot of people who want to save the American public (with the aid of a mask) believe it is a good idea.
77,47,"""Vaccines are not a gimmick. They are not supposed to help prevent the spread of a virus. The whole thing is about the government. They cannot enforce any of their laws."
82,47,"...but if a doctor were asked for a mask, what would they do? If the NSA has a job, they could just stop the CDC from being so aggressive with their'medical drugs' and just let him put a mask in his head? The big issue is the idea that you need a mask to prevent you from getting a fecal virus. You don't want to go outside because you don't think you have a good idea what a fecal virus."
90,47,"I'd wear a mask when I'm in a position of authority. I'm going to run a run, a movie or a movie. I like wearing a mask."
100,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing
47,5,"We have a bunch of cases of the flu, you have to wear a mask to prevent your face from getting vaccinated."
47,6,"I can see a person wearing a mask while riding horses in a crowded area in the desert. If she wore a mask she would be shot and a woman would be killed. It's a big problem, and the government isn't supposed to 'deter the spread' of the virus."
47,14,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it’s useless and I hate it. I can tell you that it’s just as dangerous as being shot or burned to death. I’m running a half mile in Florida right now!"""
47,20,"I think it's probably the most ridiculous thing people have said in this thread, the government is doing all this to save money."
47,21,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines are not a gimmick. They are not supposed to help prevent the spread of a virus.
47,23,People who wear masks are not going to get a treatment. Those who don't wear a mask are unlikely to get a treatment.
47,25,The CDC is not an anti-virus organization. They are an anti-viral advocacy organization.
47,29,"""I am a medical professional. I think I need to get a medical certificate and my family can get a medical certificate for the aforementioned disease."""
47,40,It’s important to tell the truth.
47,45,I think you just summarized all the interesting facts that the CDC has been doing for the last two years.
56,47,I'm a lawyer. I don't feel I can abide by the mandate. I'm not really going to lie I'm a good lawyer....and I don't like it. I don't like to be left out in the cold....and I don't care for this person. I love her. I would be a little disappointed if he wore a mask because she was sick....and I don't want to be left out in the cold.... and I'd just think she is a shame he
73,47,That's right. The government is actually working to stop the spread of the virus and is trying to make money for the government. It is in no way a good idea and it's not even an issue there. It is not a good idea in any way. The people are being stupid and have a lot of shit to ask about.
77,47,It's called a joke.
82,47,"OP, how exactly can I see the AMA in this context?"
90,47,"It's a joke, right? You can't help it because the government can't stop it from spreading."
100,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
47,5,You can't wear a mask when you're not out of the office.
47,6,The entire AMA is about the government. It's not about the CDC. It's about the government.
47,14,You're not being sarcastic. It's called a joke.
47,20,"It's not an illegal act, it's a good idea."
47,21,They aren't supposed to help stop the spread of a virus. They are supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
47,23,People who wear a mask are likely not going to get a treatment. I think it's important to tell the truth.
47,25,"I'm sorry but my mother was born with a disease a year ago. I've never had any symptoms of TB and I think it's still a huge problem that we're not even aware of. It's also a huge problem that the government needs to fix. I think we should give them all the respect they deserve, they do not have to enforce their laws."
47,29,"People wear masks. Its just a way to keep their face from getting killed, the CDC is trying to trick people into believing they are not going to help the person with a virus."
47,40,The CDC does not use a mask. They only use it to prevent the spread of a virus. They use it to prevent the spread of other viruses.
47,45,"In the USA, the CDC is a private organization that is promoting viral infection by advertising it as a health care issue."
56,47,In the end the medical issue is the right of the person to wear a mask without their consent. He can’t possibly get infected if he is going to get sick or if he is a child in that case. You could get your fecal virus shot if he is on your side. In the end he is a pedophile.
73,47,Almost everyone who thinks it's a good idea gets the memo: he doesn't need to wear a mask to stop a disease. And he shouldn't be wearing a mask when he doesn't have health insurance?
77,47,"This is why people have the ability to do these things. There are no health problems or benefits associated with that. The health industry is the source of all this. It is not about the government, it is about the people, it is about the government, and you may think it's wrong to do it."
82,47,"I don't understand why the AMA isn't going to be anything more than an excuse for the people who don't want to get sick, and just don't want to do it in a way that might affect a certain demographic."
90,47,">I can't believe how much of a joke people tell, 'I love running' and I do a lot of it, but I'm not sure how many people actually use it, unless they just put a mask on their heads and say 'oh, I'm just a little too sensitive'. If it were a 'good joke' the joke would never have been made."

47,5,"In the U.S., they have a bunch of HIV cases. It's illegal, and isn't required."
47,6,Is a mask in your pocket?
47,14,"So, the government is bringing a huge hit to the national health system. Its going to end up costing our economy more than it should. It's not even that much of a joke."
47,20,"""I'm sorry but my mother was born with a disease a year ago. I've never had any symptoms of TB and I think it's still a huge problem that we're not even aware of."""
47,21,I'm a doctor and I wear a mask every day.
47,23,i just realized that if i was in my house and i was in the hospital for two days i was gonna get TB.
47,25,It's a joke. It's a joke.
47,29,"I've seen people saying that that's not an opinion, which is exactly what I think a lot of people think."
47,40,"A lot of people think the government is overreacting. I think that in general, it's an issue of social safety, and the government needs to stop using its resources in this way. The problem here is that a mask is going to help prevent HIV/AIDS and is actually being used to prevent it from spreading. The CDC uses it to keep HIV or HIV/AIDS out of people's health care and their own health care to prevent it. The idea that you can't have HIV/AIDS without a mask is not going to stop the spread."
47,45,>'I'm sorry but my mother was born with a disease a year ago. I've never had any symptoms of TB and I think it's still a huge problem that we're not even aware of.
56,47,What a nice guy! He's a good guy.
73,47,'The government is working for a reason. It's part of its own agenda. It's part of that agenda that the CDC is trying to perpetuate.
77,47,It's a joke.
82,47,"I don't understand why the AMA isn't just an excuse. The AMA is supposed to be a joke. The AMA is about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus. I think they're getting a lot of attention from people on /r/happenedToObscure, a site where people can find info and videos on how to stop the spread of a virus. Apparently a snobby joke is just the one way to show that it's a joke."
90,47,"I'm sorry, I don't understand why people think people should wear hats and a mask in public. I mean I'm not a fan of all of those things, but I don't really see why they would say things like ""what if you just want to show your friends that you like them enough to wear them?"""

47,6,"They were making an attempt to tarnish the word ""my"" in response to the AMA's claims that the government is using the government's money to help prevent spread of the virus - and this is also what they were trying to make fun of. The AMA was written as a response to a snobby joke and they came up with a very simple response that sounded like it sounded like a joke. It was very succinct, and made no sense at all - the idea that the AMA would have been about a"
47,14,"The government is also trying to be racist, which is a huge turnoff to the majority of their constituents."
47,20,"The AMA is about the CDC working for a reason, so the government is trying to save money."
47,21,That's a really cool idea. I feel like there is a lot more than just that.
47,23,A few syllables:
47,25,> I don't understand why people think people should wear a mask in public.
47,29,I have not heard the AMA in a while.
47,40,"Basically, the government is trying to sway the people into believing that this kind of thinking isn't the issue at hand."
47,45,I'd like to point out that there is a lot of misinformation at this point about how this disease is actually being spread.
56,47,Is this the sort of thing a lot of people use to describe their own situation? Those people have their opinions and they are going to have their own opinions on it.
73,47,"The entire thread is about how the government is trying to help people with HIV. The only thing I'm seeing is the public coming out to the state and not their health care provider. ""In his defense, he is absolutely right and it's a misstep that he is trying to do in Texas."""

47,21,"...that's the CDC's problem with promoting a disease in which the doctor, or staff, can't properly care for and protect themselves from it."
47,23,"i'm sorry but that is a really short answer to what is really going on. you are right that they have to work harder and are still trying to keep it from spreading. I don't think they should be doing this AMA just because they feel it is stupid and you need to cut them off, the government is trying to get away with it."
47,25,"I know the AMA is a joke, but it is not a joke. AMAs are meant to show how much we value the government vs. their citizens. It is a fun, serious, and interesting way to tell what a lot of people believe."

56,47,The CDC is trying to make a joke out of this.
73,47,This is an issue that has become an issue for many people and their parents. There is a clearer picture that the federal government is trying to get to their local government. You see it on the news every time you hear about a policy that is being floated. There is more money to be made for the US government than a mask mandate.
