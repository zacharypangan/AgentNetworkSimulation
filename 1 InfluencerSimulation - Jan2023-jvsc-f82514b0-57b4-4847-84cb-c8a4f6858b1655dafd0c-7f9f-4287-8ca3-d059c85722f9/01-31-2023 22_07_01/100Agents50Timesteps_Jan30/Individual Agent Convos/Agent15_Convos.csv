16,15,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
23,15,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
25,15,walking out of the grocery store in florida and i m taking my mask off as i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed at her go get your groceries and be quiet lady
33,15,hr sent out an email saying those of us who s fully vaxxed w proof can go maskless again in the office yea i m good i m still wearing my mask
34,15,as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports

54,15,hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance
56,15,i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere
65,15,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
76,15,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
83,15,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
98,15,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
15,5,The new cdc rule says that people have no reason to get vaccinated if the disease is serious or persistent.
15,12,I m in Florida.. I m not the one who gets vaccinated.
16,15,My kids get a covid all the time because they don't wear masks and don't wear anything unless they get an allergy. We get them vaccinated on Saturdays but if they get one they can't wear them.
23,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
25,15,i'm going to eat my way to the back of a pig and go go see you tomorrow.
33,15,"I think I have read a lot more about that than just the title. I'm just trying to get a sense of what it's like to be a virologist, but I think people who wear a mask to do what they can to protect themselves are really bad people to be with."
34,15,I'm really confused. What was the question in your post?
51,15,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,15,You want a virus that is not gone? Yes. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,15,I have two other friends who do this. I want to tell them it's because they don't wear a mask.
56,15,If you need any more information about this vaccine.
65,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,15,Is it the same in the UK that a virus is transmitted from all the other people?
83,15,"I want to do some walking, but I don't want to wear a mask on the run route"
98,15,No wonder people wear them to ward off the spread of viruses.
15,5,"Yes, I believe it is a very vague thing."
15,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,15,Do you have a family you could meet with and spend time with?
23,15,>I think that he was being a bit of a jerk for posting this but this doesn't sound like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask at parties. It would be cool to see you around a random group of people in the orlando area. It will be cool to see some things you don't like like wearing a mask in public. They're trying to prevent spread of the virus and the wear masks as a last resort.
25,15,"I work in a psych mental hospital, and I wear a mask for my family."
33,15,"I believe the first part of the ad was a joke, since I've seen a lot of 'em coming up.'"
34,15,I'm pretty sure I have covid phobia. I don't like wearing a mask because I can't stand wearing it.
51,15,That's not what I'm saying.
52,15,"""We wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."""
54,15,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is why everyone should wear a mask every day. It’s not a way to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a way to prevent it.
56,15,So...what are you using to say the same things? Do you know where this is going?
65,15,"My dad, he had a mask while he was working, I was wearing it in his office to protect me from the viruses on my face. I had never had it before, but it was an easy way to hide my symptoms from others. I would usually wear a mask while working and have a scar - I would also use my hands to pull my hands away from the back of my face when I got my throat sore. He was also very shy with it (it got to be kinda embarrassing) and not at all aware that I should wear it while doing work he was working."
76,15,"As a person with the virus, my experience is that we have a pretty big one."
83,15,"I see you've got a pretty decent definition of the term ""who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everybody has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion"" and have no idea what you mean."
98,15,I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke
15,5,>I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke. I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke
15,12,There's a large minority of people who wear masks at parties.
16,15,I work for a drug store a lot.
23,15,"As I understand it, people need to be aware that ""what is a last resort"" to prevent the spread of a pandemic is the correct term."
25,15,My wife has had two serious asthma attacks. The first one took the form of a fever. She wore a mask because it was the only type that survived the infection and that was a combination of two different medications. I didn't want to be in a state where I would be in the ER so I wasn't at home. I think she had a fever and had a rash.
33,15,"I'm not familiar with the whole'santa' thing. I think it's more a joke than a joke. I was at the time and was told by my mother to go maskless so that she could have sex with them, or to not have to wear masks in public. I don't know why you're talking about the masks and why he was being a bad person. I don't like being around a vaccinated people, but I've always felt like it was a good idea."
34,15,I think the reason for a mask is that people are doing something like 'Mom'.
51,15,So... You don't think you have to be vaccinated in order to be infected.
52,15,"The idea that people are blaming the government is absurd and ridiculous, and I'm trying to imply that you don't realize that? I'm actually very good at that. It's almost like you are saying the government is trying to make people feel better and is doing good work."
54,15,"It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."
56,15,... and then he says I think that this is something that has been made public and is intended to be done in order to help those people. So I think that he's being so literal in that he's being so literal in that he don't want to use his face in the morning.
65,15,">Wood - what did I do wrong, sir?"
76,15,"The purpose of wearing a mask is to stop the spread of the virus. It is not inherently a bad thing, just is. You are causing problems with your body, not his."
83,15,I am not sure what a mask is.
98,15,'No wonder people wear them to ward off the spread of viruses.'
15,5,"They were used to keep people from becoming infected, not to prevent people from getting the virus. The people who did the work did not go away."
15,12,"I work for a drug store, so I don't know what to get out of this. I work for the FBI."
16,15,"I don't understand that the government isn't interested in trying to change their laws. I think that they're trying to make sure that everyone in their district has a helmet, which is a good idea."
23,15,That's exactly why I like to wear a mask when I'm not in the USA.
25,15,I have a mask for the bronchitis. Mostly for the bronchitis.
33,15,I have to say the masks would be pretty cool if a child was wearing them.
34,15,"It's just that a guy who wears a mask is going to get an immunity test and he'll likely be a victim of a virus attack. It's a different type of mask and he'll be better at identifying it. He's not going to be on the same side as your father or a kid, it's just an obvious sign of weakness."
51,15,"So, in the end, you should say that we are talking about the American people being able to get vaccinated for those who don't already have a helmet, but instead are forced to get one on purpose?"
52,15,"OP, you're stating an entirely different set of facts."
54,15,"If they didn't have a face shield in the beginning, they would not have a face mask. Is that an appropriate face mask? I've not worn a face mask in the past, or is this what they think is necessary?"
56,15,"I had a friend that told me that in order to stop this, she must wear a mask on her face. That she doesn't trust the government and wants the public to be involved. We talked about the problem because he felt he was ignoring the facts and trying to smuggle facts into his mouth."
65,15,"No, I didn't.."
76,15,There's more to the conversation.
83,15,I'm not sure how it is not. You can't just walk on the run without a mask.
98,15,The US government is very much concerned about your health. They don't want you to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses.
15,5,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
15,12,"As a retired police officer, I can tell you that the government should not let people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated."
16,15,A lot of states require people to get HIV/AIDS vaccinations. That doesn't mean that the government must prevent this from happening.
23,15,"'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You might need a ""Path Vaccine"" mask, and a patch. I don't have a great deal of respect for people who wear a mask at parties, but when they do I wear them. I'm going to wear this in the holidays because I have a sick child. I feel like he's actually a guy who was just joking about people wearing a mask, but"
25,15,What's the name of the woman who was in a mask? That is not a joke.
33,15,/r/FaxLootSucks
34,15,It's like a joke to some people with a virus who is scared of getting infected by a giant flying avian and then going to the airport with a man on his shoulders with a mask.
51,15,"I just had an episode of ""Never Been Here, Never Be Like Me"" where the government tells us that you're only vaccinated once a year and have to be vaccinated as well."
52,15,I'd make a better joke with a few friends.
54,15,People have to wear masks to prevent a virus. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
56,15,That's how the shitballs got started.
65,15,"This isn't the answer I need. You're being a bit harsh, but a great response. You are being honest. I'm just gonna get downvoted for a reason."
76,15,"[Healthcare](https://www.health.org/health-care-resources/). The article describes the CDC's decision to implement a preventative vaccine that prevents HIV from being spread amongst people he knows and knows. It's also the topic of ""I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask can prevent an infection but will make you unable to manage or adapt to the vaccination."
83,15,"Honestly I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home. It is a good excuse to stay away from the government and have a conversation. You need to know who you are so you can ask the question of who is the best people for you, and what they are trying to do about it."
98,15,I think it is the government's job to stop any government from trying to force your husband to wear a mask. It is not funny.
15,5,"This is not the first time anyone has mentioned the CDC vaccination issue. They're talking about a really important issue of public health. It is about the protections against HIV. There's no reason why this would be a joke if it didn't even involve vaccinating. They're also concerned that if people were to be vaccinated they'd have an idea of what is going on in the world unless the virus was on their face. This has nothing to do with the US government, and it's a serious concern for them."
15,12,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
16,15,"Well the problem is that the government isn't trying to change their laws. You don't have to wear a mask on your job, you don't have to wear a mask on your face. The government is trying to make you think that it's their job to protect you from viruses. The government is trying to make people think that it's their job to protect people and make them think they are good."
23,15,>Isn't the US government actually putting up with this?
25,15,The article says that the government is making attempts to stop the spread of a virus.
33,15,No one is going to have a vaccinated child that could shave after they're in the meds. This was a joke and a joke. Not a good idea. It's a lot of people trying to justify it and you end up resenting the government for wanting to try and force him.
34,15,">The guy was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown. You have a lot of options but do you have the time? Because I guess you can't."
51,15,"He's not the president of the US, and the CIA is not the government's hsiv/raised by people like you"
52,15,I would try to do a funny joke.
54,15,"I'm a woman, but the way they say that's a joke, and you have to wear a mask is just hilarious, because we're doing it for fun."
56,15,>Is he being irresponsible?
65,15,"In all fairness, I thought the first sentence was ""...well, I don't think I could tell why someone wouldn't wear a mask in a hospital because I think they're a big and silly joke."""
76,15,A CDC article is actually not an article.
83,15,"In my country, the people who wear masks have zero say in whether or not they're allowed to wear them. I can't imagine how people in this country feel."
98,15,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's really funny. What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke. I am not saying that the people I know that wear masks are all jokes, but that the joke is not one of them."""
15,5,"I can tell you that I'm not the president of the US, and the CIA is not the US government's government."
15,12,There is no time for the government to change laws. It's not your job to enforce them. It is yours to choose the way to act.
16,15,"He was joking. I'm not gonna argue with him, but he's really trying to put a ""repair"" on it. There's a difference between telling the NSA to prevent a viral infection and the NSA trying to discourage them from trying to ban it."
23,15,"I am a big fan of Obama's'suspect'and think he was joking, not joking."
25,15,What the fuck do you think about a mask being part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
33,15,"I'm not a virologist but I know someone who has never had an infection and knows them well enough to know that they aren't doing that in public, even in public. This is a joke."
34,15,"If you want a funny and original joke about that and you're like, ""I'm not even going to use the word fucking."" then I say the best thing you can do is go see an actual movie about that."
51,15,"That is what I think. I mean, I've never heard of a government saying that people wearing a mask while vaccinated are illegal?"
52,15,... I don't even want to be a santa and the moon run
54,15,That's not how this happened.
56,15,"I'm not sure if I understand what the word ""responsible"" means in the context of this, but I see a lot of people who think wearing a mask is stupid. The word mask is a valid word."
65,15,"There's nothing I can do about your story that is going to make you feel better. I have a huge issue with wearing masks. There's no way in hell that someone who did something really stupid, like the CDC, can find out they can help."
76,15,"So, if I had an AIDS infection with a mask, I wouldn't wear it, or would I? Or maybe I should just re-tread that as a vaccine? It is so bad, it is so ill suited for my specific symptoms."
83,15,"This is not about a good joke, this is about the government doing it to protect people from HIV/AIDS. This is about what it does to protect people from HIV/AIDS."
98,15,I'm trying to come up with a word that would make you think that this is a joke. I think it would make you think a joke is going to work in your favor.
15,5,"This is how it works. You aren't saying it's an illegal act, but you are saying that it is part of the vaccination measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
15,12,The CDC has no say over whether or not people wear a mask at parties.
16,15,It's hilarious. It's so unhelpful.
23,15,"If they want to rip you off, they will."
25,15,"He wrote a post about ""What's the last part of this is a joke. I don't see any reason for people to be ashamed of having a mask in public. This is part of the reasons people wear one. This is not about the government. It is about people having their own way of dressing."
33,15,"This is a joke, but this one is pretty funny."
34,15,"I don't think it is funny to say that the idea of wearing a mask is based on a false alarm. It's a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. There aren't enough good people to get vaccinated for a virus, and there aren't enough people to get vaccines to help people. The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a health issue, and"
51,15,>The public has a duty to provide us with information that helps us find ways to get vaccines.
52,15,That is a serious question. The government is using the CDC to have an emergency situation and prevent a pandemic.
54,15,"It seems like the joke came out of someone saying that it is a joke. It is because people are a bit naive to think it's a joke, because it doesn't work and the government isn't doing it for fun."
56,15,"Well, let's try and figure out where the ""I'm not a lawyer, but I think you have a right to a full body mask. You need to learn how to use it. I have a mask. I think i read this as ""We are just doing this to help people get healthy."""
65,15,"No, the CDC is not the one in charge of the HIV epidemic. That's why they would give the vaccine the CDC cannot help. They have an anti - HIV program."
76,15,"CDC. *I thought this was an actual question. No, it's not a cliche. You can't tell me this. As someone who has no control over HIV, you need to be patient. The US is going to be one hell of a place. Yes! They can't help."
83,15,A bunch of things that have never been mentioned in any other post in this sub:
98,15,I'm gonna tell you something if you are asking a question and I'm not going to do a better job.
15,5,"AIDS is the major epidemic that threatens to spread throughout the entire world, and the US is not trying to stop it."
15,12,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
16,15,"*As I have told you, that ''this guy''s on a plane without a mask''."
23,15,The government has the right to slander people for it.
25,15,"People need to go to the doctor. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
33,15,"I'm not a virologist, but I've heard a ton of stories about a virologist who goes out and is actually trying to get a better grasp of what it's like to be a virologist."
34,15,"So, this guy is probably an NSA guy?"
51,15,Vaccines are illegal. Vaccines are a legitimate medical requirement and the government is trying to make it illegal.
52,15,"I would like to have a conversation about the concept of ""protection"" but I think the idea of the CDC being the only company responsible for preventing the spread of HIV was completely misguided. The CDC is the only one that can tell you a lot about this."
54,15,"'I don't wear a mask in public"""
56,15,"""I want to start the conversation but don't want to help. I don't want to help. He got sick and his friends went and threw up. I'm so sorry Mark. It's been a while."
65,15,What do you mean when you say it in the context of the problem?
76,15,CDC endorsed a mask against the spread of the virus.
83,15,That whole “We don’t even have to wear a mask on a job” joke is just ridiculous.
98,15,"It's called a ""joke"", but there is no right or wrong way to put it. So you'll get all the jokes. I'm not sure if you can't find a funny one but I think it's funny and you should just leave it alone."
15,5,"I think you're getting a lot of people that aren't very interested in the idea of a ""joke"" and why the US government is trying to slander you."
15,12,I think the whole question is: what does the president do when his wife gets sick? What does he do if he becomes sick in his life? Why do he wear a mask?
16,15,"''I'm not going to be a doctor, I'm going to get in trouble.""'' ""This guy''s on a plane without a mask.""''"
23,15,"They are the people who are slandering, and you have nothing to prove that you're joking about it. The government has the right to slander people for it."
25,15,He said there's a reason he's not being a doctor
33,15,"What if somebody says ""You wear a mask"" and then replies ""I want you to wear a mask.""?"
34,15,The only difference is that he'll be better at identifying it. He'll be better at identifying it. He'll be better at identifying it. I'm not saying that he's probably an NSA guy. I just think he needs to be able to deal with his own problems without taking it personally.
51,15,We have a lot of things going on.
52,15,Why don't you just take off the mask and make a joke.
54,15,Affirmative action is essential for this.
56,15,"I think you're overreacting, but you sound really stupid."
65,15,"I just found out that a lot of people don't want to wear a mask at all. If a doctor says 'I want to wear a mask, it won't work for me, because it will help me stop the spread of a virus.' But that is a joke."
76,15,"People with HIV are using it to protect them from their HIV, not their disease."
83,15,I am in Florida and I wear a mask.
98,15,That's not funny. It's not a joke. A lot of people do. So it's not funny.
15,5,I think it's a joke.
15,12,"He has the right to be a doctor. He knows that it's illegal, he knows that if he becomes sick in his life he gets in trouble. But that's not what a mask does for the body."
16,15,I've never heard of the AMA.
23,15,"In a government that is slammed as a joke, you don't think they are slandering people for it. I would be joking if someone was being funny about someone wearing a mask."
25,15,"""I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."""
33,15,It's a good thing the AMA has done a decent job.
34,15,"I like that this ad is the ol'''oh, this was not funny' or 'every single thing was a joke'"
51,15,"Vaccines are illegal, but they are very dangerous. The problem is people get sick in the form of a mask."
52,15,They are trying to make people feel better.
54,15,"""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies? I would think the one that was a joke was wrong, and not funny at all, That was the entire point of the ad."
56,15,"It's a petty title, but the ad is a legitimate, if I'm not mistaken."
65,15,">I have been trying to write a little bit about the virulent form of HIV/AIDS and I think it's cool but I'm getting downvoted for it. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,15,"I'm afraid I'm not gonna get a big answer if I can't read the rest of this: the CDC endorses a mask, and they say it's useless, and that's the entire point of that."
83,15,>We are not legally required. and they are not required. Because I'm a man and I don't believe in the masked system. I am in Florida and I wear a mask.
98,15,"A bunch of people say ""I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke. I love wearing it because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke.

15,5,">He doesn't want to be a doctor. He knows that it's illegal, but they are very dangerous. The problem is people get sick in the form of a mask. They are trying to make people feel better."
15,12,"I'm not a big fan of anything that looks like a shitton of shit in the first place, but I don't think the idea of a shitton of shit about the disease is really that ridiculous. I don't think the issue is with people wearing a mask, it's that people can't have a virus because they are sick."
16,15,I read the book and thought it was an AMA.
23,15,"[The NSA and the CDC are just working together](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293)"
25,15,"If you're a doctor, you're not a doctor. It's not the CDC, but it's a CDC group. Vaccines, not a government agency."
33,15,"I don't think a lot of people can disagree with the AMA's point about 'Have you read a lot about that than just the title?', ""The first part of the ad was a joke, since I've seen a lot of 'em coming up.'"", ""I believe the first part of the ad was a joke, since I've seen a lot of 'em coming up.'"", ""I'm not familiar with the whole 'Have you heard 'Have"
34,15,"This is going to be a real discussion and the way I see it, I'll go ahead and explain what I'm thinking. I'm afraid I don't get why people hate the NSA. I just don't get why they would want to be in the public domain."
51,15,Vaccines are legal. They are very dangerous. The problem is people get sick in the form of a mask. I'd rather not have a dick in my mouth and be a lawyer instead. I'm in the USA and we have to use my face to stop this from happening. I want to give them a mask if they're going to do it. I'm in the USA and we have to use my face to stop this from happening. I want to give them a mask if they're going to do it.
52,15,It was a great way to get people to stop a pandemic.
54,15,"... and a mask is just hilarious, because we're doing it for fun."
56,15,"I'm not a lawyer, but I do know how many people have a phobia of the word ""mashing,"" and I've only heard a couple that actually know what I'm talking about. It's hard to say, but I'm trying to guess that it's the sort of thing where a person can say or do anything they want about what their husband does and you're not in the right, if you want to."
65,15,"I was a doctor, and I was able to go for an appointment. But I wanted to see a doctor. I just wanted to get a more thorough look at the situation. I was nervous for hours - and I couldn't, I got a lot of infections. I got my hands on a virus in my hand. I got into a lot of trouble. I was able to take it off while I was at work, and I was able to have some kind of restraint. I was working to help, but it was a big pain in the ass"
76,15,"Its not a joke, it’s a statement and it’s a good one."
83,15,Obviously it's a joke. I think it's also a joke that the government is trying to avoid a dilution of a good joke.
98,15,I want to be a doctor.
15,5,You need to talk to a doctor before you go.
15,12,Vaccines are illegal. But they are not mandatory.
16,15,"No. This is a joke. The government is trying to ripoff the book. It is an anti-virus film. I'm going to be honest with you. Why the hell do I wear a mask? I'm sorry. No one likes wearing a mask at parties, even if they have to talk about it. It's hilarious. It's a joke. It's funny. There's a difference between telling the NSA to prevent a virus and trying to discourage them from trying to ban it."
23,15,What was the joke? What did you think was a joke?
25,15,"I am a doctor. I wear a mask every day, not in public or in public."
33,15,No one is going to have a vaccinated child that could shave after they're in the meds.
34,15,The movie is not going to be funny. The movie just has a bit of a tv show that has been on the air for years. This isn't a tv show.
51,15,This is about the CDC's propaganda.
52,15,"People are sick after not having a vaccine because of some unknown issue. A lot of the people in the story are probably wrong. I think it's a rip off of the book that's called a ""joke"", but it's a ripoff of the book."
54,15,"The phrase I wear a mask in public is misleading, which seems to be in line with the title. This is not a joke, it's a joke."
56,15,The way people are using a petty title is the kind of thing that a lot of people think wearing a mask is stupid. The word mask is a valid word.
65,15,"My mother is a very experienced ENT specialist and she is very confident with my decision to go to her doctor to get tested for HIV/AIDS, and she's very confident that it will prevent the spread of the virus."
76,15,Because it's a bad idea to prevent the spread of a virus.
83,15,"It's called a ""joke."" I am not a lawyer."
98,15,I've noticed a lot of people are actually quite nice about this...but they just can't take it from me.
15,5,That's a very nice joke.
15,12,"He's gonna end up in trouble, and in trouble."
16,15,It's a joke. It's funny. There's a difference. It's funny. There's a difference. There's a difference.
23,15,"I've got some questions for you, too. I mean, I don't know about you but I'm just wondering if you know the answer to your question."
25,15,">I am a doctor. I wear a mask every day, not in public or in public."
33,15,"'My mom was saying that if I am a doctor, I'm going to get vaccinated '"
34,15,So basically the entire concept of a mask is inherently a ripoff of the book.
51,15,I don't have a lot of info.
52,15,"It's a joke, and I think it's a joke too."
54,15,> Isn't it a joke about people not knowing how to use their masks? I don't think the CDC would ever have an interest in you wearing a mask when he is in the wrong place.
56,15,It's a funny thing how people try to make a joke about people putting a mask on them when a doctor says the same thing
65,15,It's really a shame that so many people don't understand why people don't wear a mask.
76,15,"My doctor gave me an antibiotic that was a good idea for getting the HIV, but not for my AIDS. The doctors say the symptoms should be controlled and that it is actually a good idea for those who are sick. Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone."
83,15,"It's called a joke because the government is trying to avoid a dilution of a good joke, not because it's a joke."
98,15,"I can't tell if it's a joke, but it is a joke that I love."
15,5,"It's called a ""joke"" because of its ability to prevent viral spread. The CDC has a right to deny or not deny the need for the CDC to have vaccines to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. But I think they're trying to get rid of the idea of it. I can tell you that I'm not a lawyer, and they are not the government's government."
15,12,The government has no say over whether or not people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated. The government has no say over whether or not people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated. It is a ripoff of the book.
16,15,I love that the CDC is taking this so far without being a joke.
23,15,Vaccines are a very dangerous drug. The CDC and the public are similar but not necessarily a government entity.
25,15,"It's a joke to not say a word to somebody like that, OP. This is just a joke."
33,15,The whole AMA has made me wonder why this guy is being a jerk.
34,15,"I am a huge fan of NSA, and even though I have heard a few jokes about them I am not surprised it is still an idea."
51,15,"As long as it's a joke, its not a joke. It's a joke about how people get sick, because they're supposed to have an opportunistic fear of infection. A funny joke is just an attempt to make people uncomfortable and comfortable about it."
52,15,What are you getting out of a CDC report? You can’t have a CDC report and the government is trying to make the government do something about it.
54,15,'Hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance '
56,15,I'm just putting this in context.
65,15,"I have to say I really like the joke. Its funny, funny and empathetic. The humor is kinda infuriating. It's the best."
76,15,It sounds like the joke is to help people with HIV stop AIDS.
83,15,Vaccines are not legally required but in some places you do not have to be a doctor to wear one. I have no idea how that's possible.
98,15,I think the joke 'I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke.'
15,5,"> ""i love that the CDC is taking this so far without being a joke. I love that the CDC is taking this so far without being a joke."
15,12,People like to make fun of people because they hate the idea of wearing a mask at parties.
16,15,"The movie is a joke, but there's a difference. There's a difference."
23,15,"'We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. I’m just my friend. I’m just my friend. I’m just my friend. I’m a doctor."
25,15,I'm a doctor. I wear a mask every day. I don't know if it works for me or not. I don't like the fact that there's a joke.
33,15,"A lot of people have no idea what that AMA is about. I don't know the specifics of why the AMA is so enlightening. I know it's a lot of people who actually think this is an actual issue. And the people who say it are actually a joke, that's why they believe the AMA is a joke."
34,15,"There's more to the story, the more I get this idea of ""We need to protect our health as well. If we want our privacy to be protected then we need to protect our children."""
51,15,People wear masks all the time. It doesn't help if you're in a petty situation and someone is making a joke. It fucks up people's lives.
52,15,I am so glad that someone in this thread is pointing out that in our society they have an authority figure. You know who you are going to tell that a joke isn’t a joke.
54,15,"I think that if you wear a mask, you're a racist because you're racist, but if you wear a mask, you're actually going to be making fun of that person. I think the joke is being interpreted as an insult to the public if it's not a good joke."
56,15,"if this happened to a guy on a motorcycle he wouldn't have been able to wear a mask and have a fecal virus shot if he is not the one on the bike. he would have to be the first to wear a mask if he was not willing to wear a mask on himself, and not just for a good fight, a real good joke and then put up with it."
65,15,"I can't say it's true, but it's still a joke. There are lots of people who do this and are pretty good at it."
76,15,... it's a bad idea to prevent the spread of the virus?
83,15,I have a few friends who wear masks as well.
98,15,I've always felt like my therapist would be the first to get my phobia away. I'm also sure a lot of people are interested in trying to be nice to me. I think that is a little extreme.
15,5,Is it possible you were able to say he was trying to be funny?
15,12,Vaccination is not a mandatory vaccine.
16,15,"The AMA is a bit of an absurdity. It's not a joke and it's a good idea, but the government is making it a joke, it's a joke. It's also a joke."
23,15,"The guy is joking, not joking, and he's not in the USA."
25,15,Vaccines aren't for life.
33,15,He's implying that his opinion is a joke. He's implying that people who don't care are crazy. He doesn't care about the fact that people don't care.
34,15,A doctor in my state had a problem with a man getting a fecal virus and they said no. They were just being a troll. They have nothing to do with the CDC. It's an awful joke.
51,15,> The main topic in the story is why I don't think people are getting the vaccine. Vaccines are not legal because they protect against all types of viruses. Vaccines are not legal because they protect against all types of viruses.
52,15,"The word “joke” is a joke, and the phrase “joke” is something that many people think, to be honest. Honestly, I don’t know. If you’re trying to make people feel better in a context where you’re a joke, it’s actually a joke. I don’t think there is much you can do."
54,15,What a joke. That's it.
56,15,"[I'm a lawyer]. I can't stand the word pedophile if a guy has to be dressed in a mask to get sick, so I have a full body mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask. I have a mask."
65,15,It's a joke. You are making it up.
76,15,"I’m gonna go into details, please."
83,15,"In my country, people who wear masks have zero say in whether or not they're allowed to wear them."
98,15,My friend was actually talking to someone about this and he was about to rape her and say he thought the guy had done it and that they thought he had done it so they would stop it. He says they are being nice to him and that he was worried about him going to the party.
15,5,"A friend of mine got a fecal virus from her mother. She wanted to get the vaccinations because her mother felt like she had just done it, and she thought it was a joke. She told the other person, ""If you want to be a doctor, you should get one."" She told him, ""Well, I know that's funny and if you're a lawyer, you should get one too, because I know you're going to do it too."" He said, ""Well, the fecal virus is a joke."""
15,12,"""The CDC has no say over whether or not people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated. It is a ripoff of the book."""
16,15,The AMA is a joke.
23,15,I don't understand why he is joking if the government is making a joke.
25,15,"My wife just went to the doctor's office, took a shot at a doctor, then a doctor told her that she has a terrible cough and a bacterial infection (it was mostly from the pulmonary infection). She thought she was infected, so it was a pretty serious problem. The doctor said she wanted to see a systd., and when she told her about it, she got really sick and ended up in the hospital, not the hospital."
33,15,"I'm an AMA moderator for a community health center, and I don't care what the title says. Whenever I hear an AMA post that's literally just a shitload of nonsense."
34,15,"""We need to protect our health as well. If we want our privacy to be protected then we need to protect our children."""
51,15,"In the article, he suggests that we keep wearing a mask to stop it from happening."
52,15,It's a joke.
54,15,What is the purpose of wearing a mask?
56,15,It's not funny at all. It's just a joke. A lot of people do not realize that. There's a lot of people who just find it silly to go about a joke like that.
65,15,>Hey. This is something that is very difficult to come by. I don't think there's a way to fix this for you right now. I'm a doctor and I've always been the type to go to doctors about it when I get sick.
76,15,Is it not a joke? I don't understand.
83,15,"You're an idiot for not knowing what a mask is, you're just a jerk."
98,15,I am not a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I am not a doctor.
15,5,The CDC is using people's body parts to be a disguise to protect the public from the spread of HIV. The public can't just be vaccinated. They just use their bodies as masks to help protect public health. You should read the AMA before you try to read it.
15,12,This is a really interesting topic.
16,15,"This is a joke. A joke is a joke, and an AMA is a joke."
23,15,Isn't the government actually putting up with this?
25,15,">I know the AMA is a joke, but it is not a joke."
33,15,This is the AMA. This is a joke.
34,15,I think it's important that the CDC have an indepth background on the topic and some of the key points.
51,15,I think you should also think about the number of people getting vaccines.
52,15,The CDC wants to make a joke about a situation where people aren't vaccinated.
54,15,"""We are not going to stop the spread of HIV or AIDS, because it's an extremely bad idea. In a nutshell, I read it as a joke. It is because people are a bit naive to think it's a joke. It is because people are a bit naive to think it's a joke, but if you wear a mask, you're actually going to be making fun of that person. I think the joke is being interpreted as an insult to the government."
56,15,I would not consider it a joke. But it is one of those things.
65,15,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,15,"CANNOTANSWER: [I grew up with the disease and the mask and the AIDS epidemic in the states](https://www.health.org/health-care-resources/). The CDC says there is a difference between a mask and a vaccine, and a mask doesn't help."
83,15,The fact that the government is trying to change a good joke to a joke isn't a joke.
98,15,I think it's funny that a lot of people wear masks. My opinion is that they are not funny but they are funny. A good one is that if you wear a mask because you have a fear of getting sick you are not a good guy or healthy. This is not a joke.
15,5,I'm an idiot for not knowing what a mask is. I'm not a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I am not a doctor.
15,12,The CDC is a joke. It is a ripoff of the book.
16,15,"The AMA is a joke. I think the point is that a lot of the jokes have been pushed into the background, but a lot of the ones that got a kick out of that were mostly like, ""Is it a joke, but I think it's a joke"" and not about the AMA."
23,15,"So if I were an American, the only thing I'd say to a guy who wears a mask is that the government doesn't know about the disease, it's not a joke?"
25,15,The AMA is the place for people who are asking how to change a joke. They will answer them and tell the world they have a bad joke about what they're about.
33,15,"People are scummy, but they think it's a good idea. It's one of the best AMAs I have ever seen."
34,15,I know you're gonna go see it.
51,15,I can't believe people don't read the comments... and the CDC is in fact trying to force anyone to wear a mask.
52,15,"I see no reason to support a ""joke"" like that."
54,15,"...I've seen all of these jokes....and the CDC. My wife was the first person to say that the idea of wearing a mask was the correct thing to do,"
56,15,I want to make a joke about how people think that. But I can't understand what that is.
65,15,"So, how do you think the CDC is making this joke?"
76,15,"People don't care about the CDC's policies about AIDS, they care about the health of everyone, which means if you don't have an HIV / AIDS diagnosis that is an issue and there's no need to put your face around your mouth."
83,15,"Yes, the government is trying to change a joke into something that's valid."
98,15,It's a joke.
15,5,I don't think this is an actual joke.
15,12,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,15,"I don't understand why the AMA is hilarious. It's so unhelpful, and it's a joke."
23,15,I was going to post the same thing here... I had to read it but it wasn't funny and I wasn't sure if i liked the concept.
25,15,I'm pretty sure this is a huddle joke.
33,15,AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA: AMA:
34,15,I really don't know how I understand the CIA's 'hilarity' with the NSA...
51,15,"Yes, I agree. There is a lot of things going on."
52,15,"We use masks to keep people from being vaccinated. That's what a joke is. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases. That's true of people whose homes they're in. The most obvious example is that people who are infected don't really know what to do, since they know that they are infected because their bodies have evolved from the virus."
54,15,It sounds like that's exactly the kind of thing a lot of people are talking about.
56,15,The problem with this is that a lot of people think that the government is doing something so bad. I would say that they are trying to make it funny to people in terms of making a joke about people putting masks on them.
65,15,"I'm a doctor and I'm a doctor. I don't think a guy is trying to be a doctor, I don't think it is."
76,15,"I don't have any experience with this, but I know that the purpose of wearing a mask is not to prevent the spread of the virus, but to prevent the spread. The mask is also supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus, which is not the same as in the UK."
83,15,">I see you've got a pretty decent definition of the term ""who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everybody has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion"" and have no idea what you mean."
98,15,I think the joke is that a lot of people wear masks.
15,5,"I like that you're saying you aren't a doctor, and that you think it's a joke."
15,12,Because I am a doctor whose job is to protect my wife if I get sick and I can't get into her room to wear a mask because I know I should and have the best chance at staying healthy
16,15,>the government is trying to rip off the book.
23,15,"""Its a joke. Its funny because it is not a joke. The joke is aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, not the spread of the global AIDS outbreak."""
25,15,"[Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The CDC, not the FDA, is not authorized to prescribe a mask for public health unless the people wearing it have written written permission from their own government."
33,15,CANNOTANSWER: The author jokingly told me that the AMA was a joke to try to stop the spread of AIDS. It’s not a joke.
34,15,I feel like they're being very clear about their motives when they're able to make a joke out of it. I'd put it down to the NSA's lack of awareness of their work and a lack of awareness to prevent them from trying to get vaccines.
51,15,Is it a joke?
52,15,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
54,15,You're going to have a hard time understanding it.
56,15,"''I think you're overreacting, but you sound really stupid."" ''Well, let's try and figure out where the ""We are just doing this to help people get healthy.""

65,15,"What a lot of people are making up about the ""I didn't wear a mask in my office, and I didn't have any health insurance"" jokes."
76,15,They should start putting a face around your mouth. It's an excellent way to let the doctor know you don't have a symptom.
83,15,Vaccines are not legally required in most countries because they are not mandated by the government. A number of countries have different rules about how to make a masked swab.
98,15,"I was about to tell you I'm a terrible person for not knowing what I'm going to say. But I'm going to say that I feel a little bad for doing this because I can't stand the lack of dressing up to my face, it doesn't sound like it's funny."
15,5,"I've only ever seen it used in jokes, so I would be curious to hear how it would be perceived in that context."
15,12,That is a pretty interesting topic.
16,15,"I mean, I ain't not gonna get the whole movie, I'll be the person that tells the story, so yeah, I can't imagine a lot of people who wouldn't know what the AMA was about and how it's about the AMA, but I have to take it to heart."
23,15,I love that they don't even have to ban a mask
25,15,"And in the AMA, he says that he's a fucking doctor, but I don't think there's anything to savor about having a mask. This has nothing to do with how many jokes people make about the government, but it's about how the government is making a joke about the government."
33,15,CANNOTANSWER says the doctor's idea was to prevent a disease and not to save lives. The AMA itself was not a joke. It is actually a joke.
34,15,I think you're making the wrong impression here. A CDC AMA is just a ripoff of the book.
51,15,"I was actually doing a post on this subreddit a few weeks ago about how Americans shouldn't get vaccines in their homes because of sexist jokes. I was just thinking about getting a mask in front of the doctor, because you see you don't like that part of it, but the fact that you wear it while you're vaccinated helps."
52,15,"They're making a joke about the fact that if someone gets a flu and is vaccinated, they'll get a flu."
54,15,"Vaccination is a mandatory thing for government officials to provide, and the CDC is not doing it for fun."
56,15,It's not funny at all. It's just a joke. A lot of people think it's stupid. The word mask is a valid word.
65,15,"""The joke is about the fact that people haven't actually taken any steps to protect themselves."""
76,15,What is the CDC doing about not having a mask in your mouth to help you prevent infection?
83,15,That... was a good joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
98,15,I have been a doctor for over 2 years and I don't like it when people try to force me into wearing a mask because I have an autoimmune disorder.
15,5,"Well, you get sick in a mask. You get sick in a mask. You get sick in a mask. You get sick in a mask. It's not a joke. It's not a joke."
15,12,Vaccination is a mandated vaccination of the US government. The fact that it is not legal is enough to help stop the spread of a virus. I think it is not a joke that it is not a good joke.
16,15,"Getting a health care professional to read the book, that's a ripoff of the book."
23,15,"""The government has the right to slander people for it.'"
25,15,No one is claiming to be a doctor or a doctor.

65,15,You're joking?
76,15,"This is one of those posts on here that seem to seem very serious, but I think I'll have to give it another shot."
83,15,It's a joke.

54,15,This is not about a joke. This is about a joke about people not knowing how to use their masks.
56,15,I think it's funny that the CDC has no official policy regarding preventing TB. It's about the government preventing TB. It's about how the government is trying to make it so funny.

83,15,I think that one of the biggest issues with this sub is that it's kind of hard to find a single reference to that one particular issue of the topic in the first place.
98,15,Is there something about this that makes you feel uncomfortable and not funny?
15,5,The CDC has the right to refuse to provide vaccines that do not prevent HIV. They can't make that decision.
15,12,"Vaccines aren't mandatory in the US and aren't mandated, so no one really knows about the safety of putting a mask on people. Then what else can we do besides to avoid it?"

23,15,">CanNOTANSWER, MD:"
25,15,"The problem is, the AMA is being trolled, and that is where this story is made. The author was clearly referring to the “real-world” and not the “big-time” joke."
33,15,A little bit of the following are taken out of context:
34,15,"I read that the new CIA rule, which says it must be carried out at least once a year, is very important to stop the spread of the virus. This is something that many people are saying. It also requires a mandate that they use to stop the spread of the virus. That's an awful joke. I feel like they are being a bit 'inappropriate' and I think it's worth looking into, but for now, it's a joke."
51,15,"If this is the one thing we can do to stop this from happening, I will be sure to add it to my list of things to do to avoid them."
52,15,People who get sick and don't get vaccinated. Are you serious?
54,15,It's a joke. People have to wear a mask to prevent a virus. It’s not a way to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a way to prevent it.
56,15,"a few months ago I got an immunization from the CDC (the CDC is the agency that makes the medical equipment and vaccines for HIV), and a doctor told me I would be in a position to get tested for the flu. The doctor called the CDC and said it would be easier to get vaccinated, but they were still in the process of trying to find cures. I had to go to the doctors office and get vaccinated for it, and my husband had to use the clinic & injections for a few weeks and it was not the same"
65,15,"I would shave my face when I wore the mask, and I wouldn't want it to hurt someone else."
76,15,... And they do not need to be honest.
83,15,So basically the CDC and all the people who are doing that thing need to have a hand in the policy-making? It has to be about protecting people. Whether or not a government mandates the wearing of masks is irrelevant to the policy — not even in the name of saving people.
98,15,"I'm not saying you should know anything about the jokes, but I'd like to point out that the jokes I like to hear about my phobia are not “jokes” but, essentially, “Jokes” to me, and not just to my own phobias.

15,5,It's a joke about not having a job.
15,12,The fact that you've not heard the phrase 'Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is a joke' makes me wonder if 'The government has no say over whether or not people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated' is a joke about the CDC.
