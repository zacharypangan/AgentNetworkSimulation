    "I'm not sure what you mean by \"I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.",
    ">I\u2019ve been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind. It was only a temporary thing, just like any other sort of protective gear.
