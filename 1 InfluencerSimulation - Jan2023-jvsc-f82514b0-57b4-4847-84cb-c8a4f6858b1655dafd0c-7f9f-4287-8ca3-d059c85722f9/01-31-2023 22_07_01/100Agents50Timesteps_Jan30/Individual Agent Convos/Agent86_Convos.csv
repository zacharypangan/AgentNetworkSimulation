87,86,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,This is going to be one of the first things people start thinking about when they become vaccinated with the virus.
86,19,It's a mask. It's a mask. It protects from viruses.

86,48,You say they're not just for me! They're not for everyone!
86,51,"Unless we put in a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona, then yes."
86,52,"I’m not sure what it is if you don’t have a mask, or don’t wear it as a mask if it is a helmet. I’d rather wear one of the masks on and wear it outside than in the closet."
86,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,56,"You could put a helmet on and wear it outside to protect yourself, or just make a mask on yourself to keep you in shape."

86,64,"The only way to get vaccines is to go to the doctor and get tested for it, then to have them removed, or else they will wear a mask for another month."
86,66,"The CDC was actually planning to start testing a mask on the next month or so. You could also take it outside for a week for example and see how it works, just like a helmet."
86,77,I wonder why people would wear it outside while they are vaccinated
86,80,"If this is true, it is possible. We are more likely to experience the onset of the virus as the people can not be vaccinated."

87,86,I know it is one of those ways that people in need and who don't have a good answer can find a reason to fear or worry.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"What is going on here? Are we talking about bringing a shield? If it's used to protect you from virus spreading, it's still a mask you can wear outside. Taking a mask and wearing a mask outside will cause the virus to spread to everyone, so there will be no protection from those viruses."
86,19,"There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines. I know that it's quite often not true, but it can be done with a few simple ideas. For instance, one person with a vaccine can wear a mask to prevent infected adults from being rabid or infected."
86,23,"""I have a feeling that if they use a mask they'll get a good deal off you."""
86,25,"There are several different kinds of masks out there. I mean, a mask that protects you from virus or a scleroscope and a mask that is intended to protect you from corona is designed to protect you from a virulent Virus and a scleroscope."
86,35,"The only way to get vaccines is to go to the doctor and get tested for it, then to have them removed, or else they will wear a mask for another month."
86,38,People that have been infested with virulent viruses in the past are still very sick and it is very hard to keep an eye on that. I would try wearing a mask or helmet while getting infected.

86,48,I have a really bad headache and it's been quite a while since I started having it and I can't remember if I had a problem.

86,58,I don't want to see how this will work. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a mask. It's a mask. It protects from viruses. I had a similar question:
86,59,I think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,64,They will be testing new antimicrobial masks that will prevent the spread of the disease.
86,66,"Is the thing you're talking about, is that you don't have to have a physical mask or anything to wear a mask. You could also take a mask and put it outside, and see how it works, just like a helmet. You also need to have a physical mask and a mask, because the only way to protect yourself, is to wear it outside while you're vaccinated."
86,77,> when would you wear a mask to keep a sick person safe?
86,80,"I didn't know there was a helmet that is so good that it has to protect the whole country, so I assumed we'd put them on ourselves and have it taken off."
86,82,Wearing a mask doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so.
87,86,I am a little bit embarrassed by my mask. I am going to get a little messy with my hand.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"My grandfather has a mask, so they've had it in a long time. Whenever I took his mask to see him, he told me he was really putting on a mask to prevent me from being infected. I wore a mask to protect myself and my lungs. When I started kicking it, I started wearing it and he told me that I had to wear a mask, and not a mask."
86,19,"a mask is a mask, and it's not only designed to protect you but it protects you against all the invading viruses that are spread in the country. scleroscopes are supposed to protect you but they are designed to not protect against infection. the one that is going to be tested for the disease is a mask."
86,23,"When I was at school, we used to wear a mask as a mask. It was just a temporary thing that we did on our way to school to teach kids. It's more a kind of mask than a helmet."
86,25,The most important thing to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a mask. It's a mask. It protects from viruses.
86,35,"I’d also say it’s not very appropriate to wear a mask. I’ve never done it before and I’ve never worn a mask before. Often I just get it on when I’m in a bad place, if I can’t, I’d wear my hand out and throw it on, and it’s not going to do anything."
86,38,"It can be used as a way to stop the spread of a virus. It also has a 'proof of infection' to prevent it from being spread in public if it is infected, so if you want to stop it, you should check to see if it is spread outside in the first place."
86,40,A mask 'protects' the health of people in a state or region that may be infected with a virus. Isn't it one of those states that allows people to wear a mask?
86,48,This is the only real solution I see.
86,51,Viruses do not spread from people to people. Vaccines don't spread from scleroscopes.
86,52,"...and the people in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't wear it in public because of the risk Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines."
86,53,The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask. That's why people keep wearing a mask.
86,56,There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines.
86,58,It doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear.
86,59,"It sounds like we are a little bit confused by your phrase. ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines.

86,66,The most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.
86,77,I think it's about making a small difference in people who need to be vaccinated. This is one of those things.
86,80,"I think it's a good idea to put a mask on the front of your neck, when you see people get infected - to protect yourself from it."
86,82,...and that everyone would have to wear it outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
87,86,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,What is your favorite way to wear a mask?
86,19,I thought I said something that was pretty simple. I'm not sure I would have understood this better.
86,23,"I've been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind. It was only a temporary thing, just like any other sort of protective gear. It's probably not for everyone, but it's not something that's in the realm of possibility in a lot of places."

86,35,I want you to know that I have not personally done it or even have ever done it before. I am a patient of a doctor and I have to wear a mask.
86,38,"A lot of science is not true, but people need to understand it. It's not like they're asking people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe"
86,40,The fact that a mask is supposed to protect you is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,48,"I'd rather not wear a mask, I just want to have people vaccinate me while I'm on the internet. I'm a troll."
86,51,"I'm a health care professional. It's pretty common to get sick people to have scleroscopes that can't detect a virus and then they can go in the bathroom and get checked and then vaccinate them, not because it doesn't spread from there. I'm still getting sick. But I'm also getting sick so I need to be sick. I can't have a fever that doesn't spread from my skin, so I don't really care why people have to wear a mask vs the first time."
86,52,It's a pretty good idea to wear a mask.
86,53,The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask. That's why people keep wearing a mask.
86,56,"Vaccines are pretty common, mainly to help the body get healthy. A mask can be used to prevent people who are sick from getting infected."

86,59,I am a vaccine and if I'm going to go outside again then I'd be wearing a mask. But I just don't have a dick or a mask. I don't need to worry about my safety. But I do need a mask. A mask and a helmet is something I'm just curious about and I think a mask makes it a lot easier for me to come up with. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,64,You’re telling me that the CDC has been testing vaccinations against viruses. That you do that to keep people from getting sick.
86,66,I don't understand how you can get test to be in a public place.
86,77,"I don't know how to make it sound that way. But I do know that people wear masks to protect themselves. That I haven't seen with the first thing on my head, which is that I've been a part of a few years."

87,86,A ad in the AMA. A vaccinated person cannot actually get vaccinated. The AMA is a bit over the top. This is the same thing as the AMA. The AMA is an attempt to prevent this sort of thing from happening.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,I like the feeling of being in a vaccinated state because it's a way to prevent TB. This could be the end result of the ad on r/amymedicalcomments.
86,19,This is one of those things that is kind of a waste of time. Especially if the patient is not immune to the virus.

86,56,"You can wear a helmet and a mask. You could put a mask on and wear it outside to protect yourself, or just make a mask on yourself to keep you in shape."
86,58,It is a shame that a public health provider and their own physicians don't have a job that focuses on preventing the spread of a virus.

86,64,I'm not saying the CDC doesn't provide vaccines. But a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is why they don't provide any vaccines.

86,58,It's the CDC that is using the CDC as an instrument to help stop spread of viruses.

86,64,"I think the AMA should be focused on 'preventing' the spread of HIV. A lot of people are worried that people will die from TB if they aren't vaccinated. In fact, I'd prefer not to listen to this kind of noise."

86,80,Vaccines aren't a gimmick. They are supposed to help people get a little safer.

86,23,So what? The government wants to put people on a list that can't be vaccinated?
86,25,The AMA is about preventing the spread of HIV. I think it's best if people have a better understanding of the disease.
86,35,Is it the same thing for the people who are faking the AMA or if the AMA is going to help?
86,38,"A bunch of people are asking ""Why are you not trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening?"""
86,40,I see what you're saying as it’s about a gimmick. It’s about the government. They can’t prevent it but they can have a little tool to give them a name if they are really not that bad.

86,56,The AMA isn't about the government.
86,58,I've seen several people expressing their thoughts about vaccines and their reaction to the AMA:

86,64,"People who are vaccinated because they do not have a disease, get an HIV vaccine if they are vaccinated, get a TB vaccine if they are not vaccinated, and then go through the AMA without any TB vaccine is not a disease, or the AMA is just about spreading disease."
86,66,I think the AMA is a great way to describe it.

86,56,"I was a kid. My mother and I used to come to a meeting with the CDC who was a big fan of a bunch of stuff like this and they were like, I don't know what to tell you. Then, while he was telling them he hated the AMA, he said it was a great way to help them get healthy."

86,25,Vaccines are for life.
86,35,I know people who would rather not get vaccinated than get vaccinated but they will have to wear a mask because they don't have a way to be safe and if people don't get it and wear a mask and a mask it's not a joke.
86,38,I don't understand how AMA is not an AMA and how it's an anti-vaccine joke.
86,40,It seems that it's just a joke.
86,48,"', ""I can't get over what you're saying. I’m not a doctor."","
86,51,"There are no vaccines that a doctor can prescribe. But the actual issue is with the health system. They can't provide the vaccine to people who are ill, and they can't have them. That's a BS point."
86,52,"I can’t believe the AMA is being used as an anti-vaccine joke, even if it does seem like a legitimate joke."
86,53,"You are a narcissist, you are a narcissist."
86,56,"AMA is a joke about a fem. You drank too much shit, you cant stop being sick from being sick from having a virus. But you can't stop being sick from getting it. So why do you think it's a joke?"
86,58,"It's funny because they made such a joke about how many people are going to have a ""whole lot more than their face"" remark that they don't want to go outside for a month."
86,59,"I'd like to comment on what you have said before, but what's the point of the AMA?"
86,64,Why are there more people who aren't being vaccinated? They're blaming the government.
86,66,Why would you want to do this? What do you think of the AMA?
86,77,"""It’s about the government and the world’s population. I’m sure it’s a joke. I’m sure it’s a joke. I’m sure it’s a joke."""
86,80,I've been in a lot of AMA's and have not had a better experience. It's just about the AMA and it's not about the AMA.
86,82,"If you want to know more about TB, look into the AMA and ask some of the experts about it. You might have seen the title a few times."
87,86,"The AMA's a joke, not a joke. The AMA is a joke, but it's a joke about preventing the spread of a virus. The AMA is not about vaccinations, it's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"I'm just saying that the people who are being lied to are a joke. Not a joke. Just a joke. But I'd apologise for the ""jake"" that was made of this."
86,19,I believe the AMA is the latest addition to the AMA and is also a joke. It's a joke about the government ignoring it because it's supposed to help stop the spread of a virus.
86,23,"Nope. I'm not a doctor and I don't think the AMA is as good as the ones that were written by a lawyer, or a lawyer, but the way the AMA is written seems to make it seem like the AMA is about the government and the world's population."
86,25,"''I'm not sure what you mean by ''I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe.''', ""I'm not sure what you mean by ''I don't think anyone would do it if not for the CDC.''''. I'm not sure why it's a joke, and it's not an anti-vaccine joke.'"
86,35,I think the only way to avoid people getting vaccinated is to keep them from going outside and not getting tested.
86,38,I've heard of them already.
86,40,"It is actually just a joke that they use to try and get people to get vaccinated. You're saying that it's wrong to assume that it's a joke, which is an obvious red flag."
86,48,"They're using a joke about a guy who gets sick with an AMA about the government helping with TB, and that the AMA is a joke about the people being vaccinated. This is about getting people to get vaccinated. The AMA is not a joke about the government, because it's an AMA about a joke about a fem."
86,51,"""This is a joke, but the point is that it's a joke."
86,52,"“If you’re a doctor, you need to be vaccinated.”"
86,53,I like the AMA and my personal views.
86,56,I hate being a doctor. Is a doctor not a doctor?
86,58,"I think the whole ""sad joke"" idea isn't the joke."
86,59,"AMA (an acronym) is a joke, a joke, a joke. This is actually a joke. This is about how they make the headline for the AMA to make fun of people and then say it in other things, such as what they like, what they're doing, what they like to do, etc."
86,64,"I think it's a joke, not an AMA, just a joke."
86,66,"""Hey AMA, we need a new AMA. I'm not a doctor and I can't imagine anyone in the US doing that."""
86,77,The AMA is basically asking if the CDC is a gimmick. And it's also asking about the AMA. That's why people aren't getting vaccinated. Vaccines aren't a gimmick.
86,80,So... there is a real joke here. What's the point of a joke?
86,82,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
87,86,"If I was a kid, I would be wearing a mask. I can tell you that I would get a little dirty if I got one, but I do not know how to say 'that's just a joke.' It’s the same joke about vaccination, but it’s a joke about prevention. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are not just for the health of a person. It’s dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. The government’s only action is to prevent the spread of a virus."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,The AMA is a joke about the CDC. They haven't developed any vaccines to prevent TB. They just continue to make them. It is about what the AMA is about.
86,19,"The AMA is supposed to protect the person who is sick, and to give the people who are sick enough to get vaccination."
86,23,"I've seen an AMA, too, about the Obama administration putting people on a list that can't be vaccinated, but not the AMA itself."
86,25,It is a joke because the author is saying it's a joke and the people were laughing because they made a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke about the government.
86,35,"I don't think it's a joke, it's just a joke."
86,38,AMA (an acronym) is an acronym based off an AMA post made by the guy who wrote it.
86,40,The AMA is the joke. The AMA is not the joke.
86,48,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The AMA is pretty much a ""How to get out of the house with a mask."" It is pretty much a ""How to get out of the house with a mask."""
86,51,I don't think the idea is worth sharing. Vaccines aren't a joke and the AMA isn't about preventing TB.
86,52,I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I have no idea what a joke is.
86,53,"There’s been an AMA written by two people who are not doctors. The one in the title is a joke, but there’s something to it."
86,56,The AMA has been around for a very long time. It's an anti AMA.
86,58,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
86,59,"The point of the AMA is to keep people from getting sick, while simultaneously making fun of people, and then saying jokes about the government, to keep people away from getting sick."
86,64,"So, in the words of a lawyer, 'How can we keep people from going outside without getting vaccinated?'"
86,66,"Yes, it is a joke. They are just saying it to a troll for wanting to avoid the spread of an illness. I hate to come across like that in the headline but I’m sure it’s just one of those things."
86,77,'I'm not sure what you mean by ''I'm not sure what you mean by ''I don't know how to make it sound that way. But I do know that people wear masks to protect themselves.
86,80,Are we discussing what the AMA is about?
86,82,"You say it's a joke. Why don't you just go on and go around the comments and be surprised? I'm a doctor and we just like a joke. If you don't mind, we'll go in and do a AMA about TB and it will get better."
87,86,I'm not joking. It's just a joke. It's about vaccination.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"AMA isn't about how people have TB. It's about a joke. I don't think you need to be a doctor to make a joke. But the article is about how people are being lied to, and it's about what the AMA is about."
86,19,"[In the words of a lawyer, 'How can we keep people from going outside without getting vaccinated?'"

86,35,"The government has no problem using them, and the AMA is a joke."

86,48,"""We're pretty much a joke about a guy who gets sick with an AMA about the government helping with TB."""
86,51,"I'm not a doctor, and I do not understand the point of that AMA and what it is about."
86,52,"People are vaccinated. They need to get vaccines, and they don't need to get to the doctors."
86,53,"I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted because I've said it before, but in response to the AMA: ""I'd prefer not to follow the AMA than just tell people how to get the AMA. It's a joke because it's about the government. The AMA is about the government."
86,56,A bunch of things that's not funny and the joke isn't a joke. Isn't a joke that's joke?
86,58,"They are just gonna talk to the other people and make a joke about being sick. Until you learn how to tell a joke about the AMA, you have to leave the house and shit."
86,59,"I like to get sick, but I don't understand it."
86,64,"""The AMA is a joke. It's about the government, not the government."""

86,80,"It's a joke, it's not a joke. It's a joke."
86,82,"I was surprised to learn that you're right about the AMA, but it's a joke and the AMA has become such a huge adolescent bullshit that it can't be a joke."
87,86,I am a doctor and I would love to be vaccinated but I can't.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,">We're pretty much a joke about a guy who gets sick with an AMA about the government helping with TB."""
86,19,AMA is a joke.
86,23,"It's not a joke. It's an observation. It's about the government, the government, and the world's population. It's not about the government."

86,35,"It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
86,38,You are actually wrong. The AMA (synonym) is a joke.
86,40,I think the AMA is very silly and silly.
86,48,"In a way, the AMA is a joke that is basically a joke about people being sick and the government helping them."
86,51,AMA is not a joke. AMA is a joke.
86,52,> I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I have no idea what a joke is.
86,53,"So, I'm getting one of those AMAs."
86,56,"AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke about the government, and it isn't about the government."
86,58,"And I think a joke is a joke when I hear the phrase 'I like to get sick, but I don't understand it'."
86,59,"Are you a doctor? The AMA is about the government and the world's population. AMA is about how they make the headline for the AMA to make fun of people and then say it in other things, such as what they like, what they like to do, what they like to do, etc.,"
86,64,That's one of the more ridiculous jokes I've read in years.
86,66,"People can AMA themselves and say they are trying to make their people feel better. Then people can ask the government to explain the meaning of that joke. And the AMA doesn't mean anything, it's just a joke."
86,77,I'm not a lawyer and I didn't know there was a law against wearing a mask or a mask.
86,80,"A doctor, a lawyer, a politician, a doctor and all the others who are sick and sick. They are all doing a lot of things that aren't funny, and that's not a joke."
86,82,"I'm a doctor, and I would love to get vaccinated, but I can't. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,86,The AMA is supposed to be a joke. Not the AMA itself.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"There's a really nifty article about how to prevent a common viral infection through a vaccine. If you're sick and the government helps in protecting you you're not infected. Unless you want to know what the AMA is about, you shouldn't care."
86,19,"The AMA is about prevention. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were a joke. But maybe it was the opposite of what they meant. They weren’t meant to be jokes because they had nothing to do with anything, they are just being a joke about the government."
86,23,Is there anything wrong with the AMA?
86,25,What is it that is not a joke about the government?
86,35,"""Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again can we developed a.

The article isn't about the government, it's about the world's population. It's about the government, the government, and the world's population. It's not about the government. It's about the government, the government, and the world's population. It's not about the government."
86,40,"I'm sure that most people on reddit like to think the AMA is a joke. I'm sure you do too, and I would hate to be an AMA."
86,48,AMAs are jokes about government help.
86,51,"AMAs are not about the government, they are about preventing the spread of the virus."
86,52,>I think AMA is a joke
86,53,"""I'm not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor."
86,56,I read the article. The AMA is just a joke.
86,58,"I read a post like this for the first time a few weeks ago about a person wearing a mask and asking the government what a joke that was. I'm not sure it was the AMA, but they've been around for a very long time."
86,59,"You're saying it's about the government, not the government. You're saying that the government will have to tell people about vaccinations to keep people from getting sick."
86,64,"... but if you're referring to a joke about a joke, you mean the one that is about the government making a joke about people being sick?"
86,66,"AMA is not a joke. It's a joke about the government, the CDC, and the government."
86,77,"Yes, there is a law about it."
86,80,"The article makes an explicit claim that the government is going to provide vaccines, as is the general perception that doctors and other medical professionals are allowed to wear masks. They say the FDA is going to make a joke about the AMA and the government is going to push it. The AMA is the joke that the government has taken out on people who want to get vaccinated."
86,82,"The AMA is more about a joke that isn't about the government, the CDC and the world's population."
87,86,"AMAs are just a joke, but they are supposed to be a joke about vaccines. They are about prevention."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"AMA, isn't the same thing that has been referred to as a joke in the past (as opposed to an AMA that was a joke). It's a joke in the sense that it's about government. It's about the government, the government, and the world's population."
86,19,"I don't know what the point of this is, but I have a feeling that the government is trying to prevent someone from getting infected. 'What is a joke? ', 'I'm just going to get a little messy with my hand. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,23,"And I have one in a drawer. And I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor. I’m a doctor. And I have a good experience. But I don’t get that the AMA isn’t funny or funny, and I can’t say if there’s something wrong with the AMA that’s about the government, the CDC, and the world’s population."
86,25,"AMA's are about the government. It's a joke about the government, the government, and the world's population."
86,35,I would like to see the AMA being the kind of joke that comes out of my head.
86,38,"... I wouldn’t be surprised if they were a joke. But maybe it was the opposite of what they meant. They weren’t meant to be jokes because they had nothing to do with anything, they are just being a joke about the government."
86,40,I have had a few TB AMAs in the past and none are really a joke. I've heard about them and I am not familiar with them but it seems like there are a number of different AMAs that are just a joke.
86,48,The entire article is about the government being a joke. The AMA is an AMA about the government providing a vaccine.
86,51,'Vaccines are not a joke. AMAs are about reducing the amount of people who are vaccinated. '
86,52,"What the AMA is about is how the government uses their own propaganda. That is, they don’t care about the facts of the AMA. That’s the joke."
86,53,"I love the term AMA. That's it, and I'm not going to get downvoted because of it. I just don't like the joke. I want to get a better understanding of the AMA."
86,56,It's about the government. AMAs are about the government.
86,58,"It's a joke because it is about the government, the government, and the world."
86,59,"Vaccines are most commonly used to prevent the spread of a virus, and because of this they help protect people from infections. Vaccines don't protect against this type of virus."
86,64,AMA is a joke.
86,66,"""We have the technology to look up the CDC's medical devices',"" 'we need it to look for vaccines', 'but we have to find ways to do it without being a joke,' ""but there is no way to do it without being a joke,"" etc. We can also find tests for vaccines in a CDC laboratory. ""It will be easier to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy."""
86,77,"I've been vaccinated for TB. It's not about the vaccines, it's about the government and the world's population."
86,80,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say: ""What the AMA is about?"""
86,82,The first part of the title is a joke.
87,86,The AMA is an attempt to prevent this sort of thing from happening. AMAs are meant to save people from a viral infection.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,It sounds like the article is about the AMA.
86,19,I'd like to think of the title.
86,23,The AMA has been in the news for a few days and now a lot of people have been being downvoted for it. It's not a gimmick.
86,25,[The AMA is about the government. The entire article is about the government and the world’s population.
86,35,This isn't a joke - this is the AMA about the government.
86,38,"In this case, I would argue that the AMA is about the government, not the public health. It's not about the government and its own propaganda."
86,40,I haven't heard any AMAs about how they are actually about the government.
86,48,"I hated a few people when I got sick, but still loved the one I read about."
86,51,"[Seriously, these are not even the actual AMAs. AMAs are about reducing the amount of people who are vaccinated and the number of people who are not vaccinated]. AMAs are about preventing the spread of the virus."
86,52,"I don't even like the idea of wearing a mask, the notion that you'd want the government to take care of them. Is the whole point of the AMA a joke?"
86,53,Well I want to say 'I love the word AMA' because 'I love the term AMA.
86,56,"Yes, the article is about the government. I love it."
86,58,So the AMA is about the government and the world's population.
86,59,They're not anti-vaccine. They're anti-health and anti-vaccine. They're about trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.
86,64,'What's an AMA?
86,66,It's a joke. This is a joke. A joke is a joke.
86,77,Because the joke doesn’t make it about the government. It’s about the government. It’s not about the AMA.
86,80,I want a tampon so bad to get sick to be vaccinated? That sounds more like a gimmick for you. AMA's are just about promoting the ada and the vaccines are about promoting them.
86,82,"You are a joke. I say it with a laugh, and you're a joke."
87,86,"""When you don't have a right to get vaccinated, you are going to get a virus that will make you sick."""
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,AMA is not about the government or the government
86,19,Why does this have a title?
86,23,"There's a lot of stuff in this thread about how doctors and people are supposed to work together to prevent people from getting vaccinated, and how they can be influenced by one another."
86,25,What's the issue with a mask?
86,35,"That's not a joke, but a humour. If you want the government to take care of your life, then wear a mask."
86,38,CANNOTANSWER - The AMA is a joke about the government and the people in the AMA.

86,48,I think there is a really good line somewhere:
86,51,I think we need to focus on some of these things.
86,52,AMA. The AMA is about the government and the people who need to be vaccinated.
86,53,AMA's are about promoting the AMA (government/private sector) and vaccines.
86,56,"The AMA is about the government. I'm not sure what that means, but I think that the article makes it look like the AMA is more about the CDC."
86,58,"You're not saying it's funny but that the joke is about the government. You're saying it's a joke because it makes them feel sick. It's a joke because that's not a joke, but that's a joke."
86,59,AMA is basically a social experiment.
86,64,Why is that a joke?
86,66,"We are also talking about a joke, not a joke. That's basically why we are putting a tampon and a tampon together."
86,77,"I'm not a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I work for a public health provider, a public health firm, and a private insurance company."
86,80,They need to be paid to go to the doctors and other medical professionals. It's an easy way to get sick.

87,86,"I'm not a doctor, but I do know I have a right to get vaccinated. It isn't a joke. It's a joke. I'm not an AMA maniac, but I can't help putting that on the top of my head, so I'm doing an AMA."

86,51,Vaccines are not a joke. AMA's are about reducing the amount of people who are vaccinated. They are about reducing the amount of people who are vaccinated. They are about preventing the spread of the virus.
86,52,I'm a doctor. I don't know what a joke is.
86,53,AMAs are just about the government.
86,56,I don't understand you. This is a joke.
86,58,"I have no idea if this is a joke or a gimmick, but I don't really know any of the other topics."
86,59,"I don't know what you're saying, but the joke has nothing to do with what you have said. It's about the CDC and the world's population. And I don't even know what that means. I mean, the AMA is just an article about the CDC, AMA, the government, the world's population, etc. But I can't really say that it's a joke, they're just making fun of the government, the government, the government and the world's population."
86,64,"As a doctor, I can tell you that while I'm not a doctor, I can tell you that I'm not a doctor."
86,66,I haven't heard of that joke before. The title is misleading. And I have no idea why a doctor isn't a doctor. But a lawyer is not a lawyer.
86,77,"AMAs are meant to help people get a little safer and prevent the spread of a virus. They aren't a joke, they're not a joke. It's a joke because you don't know how it's a joke. You don't know how it's a joke, and it's about the government."
86,80,I think this article is getting more and more eloquent and gets more eloquent.
86,82,"So the word 'vaccination' is the most recent version of the phrase ""Vaccines are for life"". What is it referring to?"
87,86,"- I don't think you understand the jokes. There are two parts to the AMA, and there are two parts to the AMA."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,A 'jew' who tells you a joke is basically saying that you can't be a doctor and get vaccinated with a vaccinated person.
86,19,"You're probably wondering if it was a joke, but not sure if it was."
86,23,"ahhhhh, how silly that is, a lot of people like that"
86,25,The AMA is just an article about the government. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor.
86,35,"r/TwoCreative is a great site, and is a great place to find any kind of information about healthcare related issues."
86,38,"AMAs are gimmicks and non-negative jokes, and they aren't a joke. They are about the government and their propaganda, and they are just a joke that I think they should be deleted and never republished."
86,40,"> I've never had any TB symptoms but I can't think of any other health care provider that I would get sick off on the weekends, because I'm an ailment."
86,48,I think people are just trying to avoid this.
86,51,">I mean, we aren't the only ones who wear a mask to get vaccinated for viruses that are spread outside. The CDC is testing it, and there are plenty of people who wear a mask to get vaccinated for viruses that are spread outside. The CDC is testing it, and there are plenty of people who wear a mask to protect themselves from the virus."""
86,52,"I think the joke is a combination of things that can help people get healthy and is good. There's also the fact that the government tries to use the word ""vaccination"" as a gimmick to stop people from getting sick, and it's very effective. Vaccines have proven to be useful for people who are on a low-risk path to developing a virus."
86,53,"I don't think you understand what the term AMA means, I mean, I've heard people say that the word is being used to refer to the AMA that it's about."
86,56,I don't understand the joke at all. I don't understand why they don't take the time to explain.
86,58,It is a joke because people are scared and afraid of putting themselves out there and asking people out for the sake of doing something they want to do that makes them feel safe.
86,59,"The point of the AMA is to keep people from getting sick and to stop people from getting sick. The point of the AMA is not to make fun of people. It is about how they make the headline for the AMA to make fun of people, and then say it in other things, such as what they like, what they like to do, what they like to do, etc. But the joke has nothing to do with what you're saying, and they're about trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening."
86,64,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, and I don't know why you're getting downvoted."
86,66,"This is a joke, not a joke. And you are being a troll. It's just about the government."
86,77,It doesn't matter if you're a doctor. It's a joke and a joke. I don't know what a joke is.
86,80,It's more like a joke about the government that's in the headline.
86,82,"The point is that the article is a joke, which is a gimmick. Because the joke is actually about the government, the government and the world's population."
87,86,I would like to point out that I've not heard of an AMA about the spread of viruses. It's about how a doctor might think that being vaccinated is an effective way to prevent a virus. It's about preventing a virus. It's about protecting the public.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"I don't really think this is a joke. A joke, on the other hand, is one that is not an article and is based off a joke. The article's main purpose is to show that people are going to start looking for a new, better way to get sick. It's one of many reasons why people are going to avoid this, and I think that's why there's so much out there to find new options. The article is about how government is trying to discourage people from going to other places and this is not a joke. It's about the "
86,19,"''I think this is a joke'' and 'I'm just going to get a little messy with my hand. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,23,The only thing you can do for now is keep yourself vaccinated.
86,25,"No, it's a joke, it's a joke about the government. The article is about the government and its propaganda."
86,35,"It's not the government, it's the people that want to be the people who get sick. It's a joke because there's a reason people don't get to keep vaccinating their kids."
86,38,"The AMA is not a joke. The AMA is just a joke that is being tossed around in my head as a way to show that we have the CDC to put together a vaccine. I believe a lot of people will actually know that this is a joke, but that's the truth."
86,40,"""Well, I have never had any TB symptoms, but I can't think of any other health care provider that I would get sick off on the weekends, because I'm an ailment. I think people are just trying to avoid this."
86,48,"You can go on a Google search for the article ""How to get out of the house with a mask"" and read the title, but you can't go on a Google search without seeing the article ""How to get out of the house with a mask."" And the title says ""How to get out of the house with a mask""."
86,51,You're not going to be able to get an AMA. This is an anti-vaccine movement that's aimed at people who don't want to get vaccinated.
86,52,"I'm not sure what you're getting at, but that's one thing: A lot of people aren't able to take any form of vaccine because of the lack of vaccines."
86,53,"I mean, that's a joke, and a joke. That's a joke. It's a joke."
86,56,"In many of the stories, the government says that the idea is a joke."
86,58,The joke is about a joke because people can't understand what it is.
86,59,"""The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it."""
86,64,"Myself, it's probably the most stupid joke I've heard to date, and if I was a kid I'd have a gimmick. AMAs have helped so many people. It's like putting a fucking football with a hammer in a trash can and it only helps in a few ways."
86,66,... I think this article is a good one because a good article like the one you're looking at isn't about how to prevent a virus from spreading.
86,77,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's about the government.
86,80,"“I don’t see why people are numb to the notion of being vaccinated. But I don’t know what the AMA is about,“ –““It’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke."
86,82,"This is the exact same thing I told my wife, and now I have a TB virus. I think I'm doing it right."
87,86,"In a very large part, AMAs are a form of public health that encourage people to get vaccinated."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,The AMA and the AMA are about the government helping with a virus. It is about the government and its propaganda.
86,19,It is a joke about the government and a joke about the government trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
86,23,That's a good question.
86,25,"I think this is just a way for the government to keep the government in a joke, and you don't need to do anything else."
86,35,I would say this to everyone.
86,38,"It's a joke, it's a joke, and the AMA is not a joke. It's a joke about the CDC. The joke is a joke about how the AMA is used, and how that joke is a joke."
86,40,I don't think that AMAs are the right term for this because they are about the government and that's why it's the joke. I think that this is not about what the AMA is about.
86,48,"I think this is about the AMA, not what is a joke."
86,51,"I read the whole article. It's kind of a joke, but the point is that it's not a joke."
86,52,> ('I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I have no idea what a joke is.
86,53,"I was in a doctor's office a few weeks ago and I learned that my GP was wrong. I was getting sick all the time, I was getting sick for a month, but the doctor refused to change my mask. So he snuck my mask out of my pocket and took some medicine. They told me to stop going to the doctor and that they would have a job, so he asked me to take it with a mask on. I told him I had to take the medicine myself. The doctor didn't want to be a fucking year before"
86,56,What is a fad?
86,58,">I don't think that is a valid idea, but I do want to see how this will work. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
86,59,"Why is the post ""a joke?"
86,64,A doctor who has a long history of going on an AMA that has caused serious problems and problems and a lot of them will continue to tell the public to go to their doctor with no problem.
86,66,This is the joke I want to make about people who have been vaccinated.
86,77,The article is about the government and the world's population.
86,80,They also have a number of reasons why people don't get vaccinated.
86,82,I've never heard of this joke before.
87,86,"In this case I'm going to say ""Oh, it is not a joke."" Or ""There is something that's not a joke."" Or ""Assist with the AMA and tell people how to get vaccinated."" or ""Just in case I were a doctor but I don't know how to say that."""
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"""I'm not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor."""
86,19,"It's not the joke, it's that it's all about the government making a joke. It is a joke, about the government ignoring the government."
86,23,"I'd say it's funny. It sounds as if they're trying to get people to try to get vaccinated, so there's no telling what that's."
86,25,"That's why I'm asking people, ""Who did you think the joke was about?"""
86,35,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
86,38,>I think that's a joke
86,40,"I'm not really sure what the joke is, but I have heard that this is a nonsense AMA. I think that people who are vaccinated are being misled. The joke is about the government, not the AMA. It's not about the AMA, but about the government. They're all trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke, and it's not about the AMA, but about the government. The AMA is about how much people need to learn the facts to prevent the spread of the virus."
86,48,''We have a lot of ways that we can get people to get vaccinated. This is an AMA about getting people to get vaccinated.''
86,51,"It's not like they are trying to change something. I think the AMA is a joke because it is about preventing vaccines. And this isn't a joke because of the AMA. They aren't a joke because they are trying to stop the spread of a virus, and putting people in a situation that they don't want to deal with."
86,52,"Vaccines are not for everyone. If you’re not a doctor, you need to be vaccinated."
86,53,"I'm actually sorry to say that I'm not a doctor, but I've not seen the whole AMA of a doctor and I cannot take any part in that decision because I'm sick - a month - for no reason."
86,56,"It's more about how you understand your situation that the joke is about the government. It's about the government, and the world's population."
86,58,I read this in a book called 'This is a joke' by an American based on a Canadian newspaper.
86,59,You don't really think people who are being sarcastic are going to understand the difference between the two extremes.
86,64,It's a joke.
86,66,a.. a joke. A joke about a government and a fad. a joke about a government and a fad. a joke about the government and the fad. a. a joke about a government.
86,77,"""Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again"""
86,80,I would say AMA is one of the jokes. It's about the government trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
86,82,">The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it.', ""I like the fact that you guys are trying to get people to know a little bit about the subject, but that you're not doing anything."", ""[How do I get out of the house with a mask?](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_care/) The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it.', ""The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it."""
87,86,"There is no law prohibiting it but they are being put on the front page, so in a lot of cases the joke will be used. The AMA is about protecting the public. It is about protecting the public."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,">An AMA is not about the government. They haven't actually developed any vaccines to prevent TB. They just continue to make them."""
86,19,"AMA is about the government, not about the government."
86,23,"IANAL, but I'm an AMA speaker at the AMA. I read this article in an article a few days ago a couple of weeks ago called 'The AMA', which is very, very, very misleading."
86,25,"I think a t-shirt will have a greater effect on the spread of the virus. However, we have to do the same thing here."
86,35,"The AMA is about how people are not getting to be vaccinated, but just not what the AMA is about."
86,38,"If you can’t tell the difference between the two extremes, you should call the AMA."
86,40,I don't really think this was a joke at all.
86,48,">The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it.''"
86,51,"People who don't want to get vaccinated? You don't understand how ""the joke is about the government"" actually works."
86,52,"AMA is a joke about the government, the government. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the disease and its effects. It is about the government making jokes about it"
86,53,"If it’s about the government, then yes, it is a joke, it’s about the government."
86,56,What's the AMA about?
86,58,"It's a joke, I read a book called this. 'I'm sorry, but I have heard that this is a joke, I have no idea what the joke is about. It's about the government, the government, the world's population."
86,59,I think a lot of this is from a guy who is a TB user.
86,64,a doctor who has a long history of going on an AMA that has caused serious problems and problems and a lot of them will continue to tell the public to go to their doctor with no problem.
86,66,I like the way you phrase it.
86,77,"Yes, it's a joke, but I think it's better to understand that there is a difference between the two."
86,80,"A lot of people don't get the joke. That's why people are sick of the AMA, mainly to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are for life."
86,82,I can't remember the exact number of times I have heard the title.
87,86,There is a problem here.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"The only reason we don't have that joke is because it isn't the joke the AMA is based off of, it's that it's the joke, it's the joke that makes you a sick ass. That's a good thing!"
86,19,"What's a joke, no kidding."
86,23,>I think the point is to say something is wrong but to show your point is that people are too busy and they haven't really gotten any information from the article.''
86,25,"I think it’s best to read the article as the author is using the phrase “the AMA is a joke,” not the government itself. It’s a joke because the author is using the word “the government” as the title of the article. The AMA is about the government. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus, and its effects."
86,35,"> ""Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again"""
86,38,This is a joke from the AMA.
86,40,I agree with you on all of the other points but I also do not know what your point is.
86,48,"I'd like to add, [I think it's better to understand that there is a difference between the two. [The article a few days ago called 'The AMA', which is very, very misleading. It is about the government, the government, the world's population.

86,51,"""I'm a physician, so this is a joke. I'm a doctor, so this is a joke."""
86,52,"I’m not really a doctor, but I do know that it is very effective."
86,53,"I’m glad this is the right place to write this, and I think the right people have the right to be a part of it. I’m not going to do this because it’s a joke but it is a fucking joke because it’s not the right place for me, and I don’t like it."
86,56,Is the AMA about the government? I don't see anything wrong with the joke.
86,58,"i read this as """"It's a joke"""" and ""It's a joke. AMA is about the government, the government, the government, and the world's population."""
86,59,I'd bet that people who are a TB user would probably understand that the government is a bad idea.
86,64,"""I don't know why you're being downvoted, and I don't know why you're getting downvoted"""
86,66,AMA is about the government and the world's population. I’ve been vaccinated and thankfully the government doesn’t make the joke about me anymore.
86,77,"I think the article is about the government, not the vaccines."
86,80,"I'm sorry, but I've heard this. I have to tell you that I was sick of the joke about the government and the AMA."
86,82,"I think the point of the AMA is that it's a joke. The AMA is a joke. The AMA is about the government, the CDC and the world's population. It's about the government, the world's population. It's a joke. The AMA is about the government, the CDC and the world's population."
87,86,"AMA is a joke. They're supposed to be a joke. They're about preventing diseases, which they haven't addressed in the AMA. They are being put on the front page. It's only a joke because it's a joke and is a joke."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"In the article it says that the article is about the government, not the CDC."
86,19,"It was a joke that a lot of people said, but it sounded like a joke. People think a joke to stop a virus would be a joke."
86,23,"The first sentence is not a joke. It is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. It's not a joke. This is a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. They're supposed to be a joke. They're supposed to be a joke. They're about preventing diseases, which they haven't addressed in the AMA."
86,25,"So, the AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus."
86,35,It's a joke.
86,38,"""Is this a joke?"""
86,40,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's about the government. It's about the government. The government, the CDC and the world's population. It's about the government, the world's population. It's about the government, the government, and the world's population."
86,48,"I'm trying to get people to take the AMA seriously and vaccinate them to avoid getting sick. What I think the AMA is about is that it helps people get sick. AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. It's a joke because it's about the government, the CDC, and the world's population."
86,51,"I think it's a joke about the CDC because they're trying to protect TB patients from the spread of it and is trying to prevent this spread of the virus. The CDC does not have the money to provide a vaccine for TB, but the CDC will provide them one of two vaccines."
86,52,"The AMA isn’t about vaccines. It’s about people who are vaccinated. They need to get vaccinated. People who are not vaccinated. If you aren’t a doctor, you need to be vaccinated. Vaccines are for everyone. If you are not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor."
86,53,...and I have to tell you that I’m actually not a doctor. I don’t think there’s a joke about what it’s about. I think that it’s a joke about the government and the world’s population.
86,56,It doesn't matter who wrote the article. They're attempting to stop the spread of a virus by using the CDC.
86,58,I don't think the joke would get much attention. The AMA is about the government and the world's population.
86,59,"I think that the purpose of the AMA is to make fun of people, and how the government is helping people stop the spread of a virus."
86,64,"In my opinion, the article is a joke."
86,66,"I just want to say: I don't really understand why people are so upset because I think a big AMA about the government is just a dick joke, and no one would want to go on it."
86,77,It's a joke because the AMA is not a joke. The AMA is about the government and the world's population.
86,80,This is really a very long AMA. I don't know what I can do to get myself vaccinated.
86,82,A gimmick is a joke if you think that's the point.
87,86,I’m a doctor who does all kinds of AMAs. It’s one of the best ways to put a joke around the AMA. It’s a joke that it’s a joke that’s only been around for a few months.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,AMA is a joke. The article is about what they haven't developed any vaccines to prevent TB.
86,19,I think you guys should probably put a word in your title:
86,23,"I think people are trying to get people to stop going through the AMA. The people in the AMA are being downvoted because they seem to be doing what they are doing and not because they are doing it. People think that when the government puts people on a list that can't be vaccinated, it's about the people who need vaccinated, and are going to use the AMA to sabotage the AMA. It's a joke."
86,25,...and I have to tell you that I’m actually not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor.
86,35,"I’ve been sick for six years and I don’t know why the world’s population hates AMAs for the same reason. I don’t know why you’d be upset about an AMA about the government or what AMA is about. I know it’s a joke, and it’s a joke, and it’s a joke, and it’s a joke, but it’s not a joke."
86,38,It's a joke about how government is the only thing that allows for vaccines.
86,40,No one needs to read this article. The main reason for the AMA is because it's so long.
86,48,"The AMA is supposed to be a joke about the government. It’s about the government, the CDC, and the world’s population."
86,51,The joke is not going to win. It will. It is going to lose.
86,52,"I can't think of any other jokes about the AMA. It’s a joke about the CDC, the government, and the world’s population."
86,53,"""This is a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."" """
86,56,">I want to see how this will work. Wearing a mask or helmet does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,58,>What I think the AMA is about is that it helps people get sick.
86,59,It's a joke. It's a joke. But I don't know what they mean.
86,64,So the entire article is about the government and their role in the world's population?
86,66,The AMA is a joke.
86,77,"CANNOTANSWER: Vaccines are the last thing the government wants, even though they are very important to prevent the spread of HIV."
86,80,"No. There is no way that ""I don't get why people are sick of the AMA because they don't want to get vaccinated"" is actually a joke and the AMA is about the government and the world's population."
86,82,You guys are promoting a vaccination for life? Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
87,86,"So what I mean is that you can't be a joke about the AMAs, you can't be a joke about the AMA's. You can be a joke about the AMA, but the AMAs are about the AMA. The AMA is about preventing disease."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"Unless you have a doctor, I don't think you understand the point of this thread. The entire article is about the government, and not about the AMA."
86,19,It's not a joke because it's about the government. It's a joke because it's about government and not about the world. It's a joke because it's about the government and not about the world.
86,23,"Are you a doctor, too? The AMA is about the government and the world's population."
86,25,I’ve jumped in to this thread wondering what that means.
86,35,That's a joke.
86,38,The article is about the government.
86,40,You're just saying that this is a joke. They're just trying to make it out to be funny. The joke is about the government and not the government. They are promoting a vaccine for life. They are the government and the world's population. It's about the government and the world's population. The joke is about the government and the world's population.
86,48,"I’m sure you have many good questions. The AMA is actually about the government helping to fight AIDS and the vaccines, not the government providing a vaccine. It’s a joke about what the AMA is about."
86,51,They are about preventing the spread of the virus.
86,52,"I think I stumbled upon this post by mistake, and have never been more confused."
86,53,I'm not a doctor and I don't think I am a doctor.
86,56,"I haven't seen a joke in a long time, but I think he meant that he was skeptic or something and didn't know what it was about."
86,58,A lot of people are sick of the AMA because they don't understand how to understand it.
86,59,"AMA is a joke. It's about government, the government, and the world's population."
86,64,a little joke? The AMA is not about the government.
86,66,The joke isn’t the AMA. It’s the AMA.
86,77,This article contains a whole series of different things that are based on the same topic.
86,80,"This is about the government, the government, the world population, and people, not the government."
86,82,AMA is a joke.
87,86,"I don't see the point of this kind of AMA. If there isn't a joke, there isn't any reason to be upset about it."
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,"> ""I don't think the whole article is about the government."""
86,19,"I think the only AMA I’ve seen in awhile is about the AMA, not the government. It’s not the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government and the world’s population."
86,23,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor. I get this all the time and am always glad I'm not the one being downvoted."
86,25,I think a lot of people are confused about the entire point of the article....
86,35,"[Women should have a vaccinated mind](http://www.dr.nhsc.gov/r/vaccines/resources/nhsc_scc_occupation.pdf) [Alright, I'm gonna go with a vaccinated mind](http://www.nhsc.gov/r/vaccines/docs/impls/scc/resources/vaccines/can't I have a mask or helmet that's really"
86,38,I think it is very logical to say that the AMA is a joke about the government promoting a vaccine.
86,40,AMA is about a fucking joke. Isn’t that a joke?
86,48,">In general it's about the government, the government, and the world’s population."
86,51,A lot of people are referring to the AMA because they don't think the AMA is a joke.
86,52,"I like this stuff in general, but here's my point: The government is trying to amplify people to try and stop the spread of AIDS and diseases, and you know why, but this is a joke."
86,53,"I have read several AMAs. The first one is about the government. The second one is about the government. It’s about the government, and the world. The first one is about the government. The first one is about the government."
86,56,"I was just pointing out that the AMA is a joke, and the author of the article is being facetious. So the author doesn't have the right to say that he has to make the joke, because I don't think it's a joke."
86,58,">This is a joke because it's about the government, the government, and the world's population."", ""I've seen several people expressing their thoughts about vaccines and their reaction to the AMA:"", 'We're wearing a mask while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are mostly to help people get a little safer.', ""I think the joke is"
86,59,People don't understand the joke unless they get a little bit confused.
86,64,I think it is also a joke that the government is trying to make it funny. They're blaming the government for all of the bad things they're doing to the health of people.
86,66,Is the AMA just about preventing the spread of a virus?
86,77,The AMA is a joke. A frank joke about the government. It's the government's goal and the government isn't the government.
86,80,I'm going to point out to you that the only problem with this AMA is that this article isn't about the government. It's about the AMA and the world's population.
86,82,"I’m a doctor. I get vaccinated and have an AMA, but I also have a TB. I’m going to go through it for my health care. But it’s my job, not my job. I haven’t had the opportunity to go through the AMA."
87,86,I don't think that the AMA is a joke because it's aimed at preventing the spread of a virus.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,This is why you don't have a doctor and you don't have a job if you don't like a joke. This is what you need to be a doctor to work in the government.
86,19,I’m gonna go with a vaccinated mind 'but I don’t think it’s funny'.
86,23,"> Is the AMA about the government, the government, and the world's population."
86,25,"The author of the article does not have the right to claim that they are a joke, nor to claim they are a joke. He has the right to assert that he is the author of the article, but the author of the article has a right to declare that he is the author of the article."
86,35,It’s not a joke.
86,38,"I was trying to say that when you talk about the AMA and it is about the government, I was trying to give the facts that it is a joke. I'm not saying that the article isn't about the government. It's a joke about the government. It's about the government. It's about the government. It's about the government. It's about the government. It's about the government, the government, and its own propaganda. It's about the government, the government."
86,40,That's very clearly a joke. It's a joke. A joke that is aimed at promoting a vaccination. It's a joke.
86,48,The entire article is about how the government is helping people get vaccinated. It’s about how government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
86,51,"I don't think people want to get vaccinated because it's a joke. Is this the first time a CDC official has mentioned the problem with this? AMA is the first time the American government has publicly said this. The article is going to be a joke, not a joke."
86,52,"Why not all the 'people who are not vaccinated', are going to get vaccinated? You can't get a lot of vaccines and still have to be vaccinated."
86,53,">The only AMA I’ve seen in awhile is about the AMA, not the government. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government ignoring it. It’s about the government."
86,56,I think the joke is wrong. There are many people who are in a similar situation and don't think AMA is anything more than a gimmick.
86,58,I know what AMA is about.
86,59,"If I had a TB I'd go to the doctor because I had a TB and got to be vaccinated for TB, but that is to prevent TB. If I was getting a TB, I'd go to the doctor because I wasn't vaccinated for TB. When I got a TB and got a TB, I didn't really go there. I went to the doctor and got TB, and the TB was worse than I had ever imagined. There was a TB, but none of the other"

86,77,AMA is an actual article about vaccines. It's not about the government. It's about the people.
86,80,"Are you in general. It doesn't make sense for me to be confused with a joke, since I'm just pointing out that the joke is just being facetious. It's a joke about the government, it's about the government, it's about the world's population, and it's about the government."
86,82,I'd like to make a list of those.
87,86,I think you're referring to the AMA as the part of a joke.
101,86,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,5,I believe that AMAs are meant to encourage people to get tested.
86,19,"So you want a new, better definition of the word?"
86,23,"""The whole story of the AMA is pretty much like ""How to get out of the house with a mask"" AMA. The joke's about how people are being influenced and it's about how people are preventing the spread of a virus."
86,25,"We have to have that kind of coverage. If it's the CDC, we'll have it by the end of September."
86,35,"It's a joke, a joke, and a joke! I don't think it's a joke, I think it's a joke."
86,38,"This is a huge AMA, and they make a lot of jokes about how AMA's are like these."
86,40,"A lot of things are a joke, but I think this is very a joke. It’s a joke. It’s not a joke. The AMA isn’t the joke. The AMA isn’t the joke. I think this is going to be a joke. It’s a joke. It’s not about the government, but about the government. It’s about the government, and the world’s population. It’s about the government, and the world’s population."
86,48,"And all of the time it’s just a joke. What you see is an AMA about a man who gets sick, and it’s only a joke about the government, but the article is about how the government is helping to fight AIDS and the vaccines, not the government providing a vaccine.

86,56,The people in question are not saying that the article is a joke.

86,53,"I grew up with a doctor who believed in vaccines. He said they were good, but because it's a joke he didn't get the benefit of the doubt. I would have told him it's a joke but it's about a government being a joke. I wouldn't have gotten it if he told me. He probably knew what it was about.

86,59,"The AMA, while being about the government, has a real point : It is about the government, the government, the world's population. And it's also about how they have to make a joke to stop a disease, and it isn't about the government, the government, the world's population."

This was one of the stories I remember reading."
86,35,"Vaccines have come a long way, and people are coming down here just thinking about the lack of vaccines. They are a joke. Vaccines are a great way to prevent the spread of a virus, so vaccinating yourself against it is just one of the best ways to prevent the spread of a virus."
