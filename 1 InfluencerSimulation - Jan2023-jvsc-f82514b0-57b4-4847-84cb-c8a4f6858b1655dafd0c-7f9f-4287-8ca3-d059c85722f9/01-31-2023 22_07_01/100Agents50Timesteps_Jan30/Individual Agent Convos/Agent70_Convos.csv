93,70,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
95,70,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
70,6,That's the first thing I said when I heard that vaccinated kids were the only ones that actually got it. I think it's important that they have the time to do a proper check and be careful of who they are getting it from.
70,21,It is very important that you have the proper health insurance coverage to prevent accidents like that.
70,22,And that is a great way to see that you don't have to wear a mask in public...
70,24,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
70,27,The CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat spread of the deadly virus at their airports. You should be familiar with what they're doing - but vaccinating children against the virus might not help.
70,34,That's a good one. There are millions of us and it will cost millions to keep a mask on and prevent an outbreak and a relapse.
70,43,>We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated.
70,54,That's interesting. You are a woman who needs to wear a mask.

70,6,This is a great way to show that you don't have to wear a mask in public.
70,21,This is the most appropriate and relevant post in this thread. Apparently there's a list of those with cdc / CDC.
70,22,"I don't even want to make this sound like a good news story. The world has moved on from the world without vaccines, and a lot of people..."

70,54,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
70,64,"If you don't have a life insurance policy that isn't mandatory, you'll need a CDC AP license to fly at your airports without a mask if you want to use them in your business. That's a lot of time for a travel insurance policy. You'll need a full health insurance policy and a sane health insurance policy."
93,70,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,70,It’s been a while since I was in college and it has come a long way. It’s really good to know that you get a little more in depth knowledge of the disease.
70,6,I can't believe that santa does not wear a mask in public.
70,21,> As encouraging as this news is please remember that this new CDC guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports
70,22,"Isn't it pretty much a fake. In the beginning they called for having a mask in public, and in the last few months you have to buy one."
70,24,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
70,27,"It's pretty much like the new CDC ""Guideline."" It doesn't require a passport, it's a rule governing the travel of people with health insurance cards. It's not a rule, but a warning sign."
70,34,I believe a lot of people who have vaccinated themselves and have been vaccinated do not think the danger is worth the cost and inconvenience.
70,43,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. The CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat the spread of the deadly virus at their airports.

70,21,"What’s funny is that, a million people still wear a mask and that’s enough karma for the government to continue their efforts. They don’t even bother vaccinating their citizens as long as they don’t have to worry about it when they’re sick."

70,27,"I don't believe people have had vaccines, but I think it is a good sign that many people will not be vaccinated."
70,34,"What's funny is that, a million people still wear a mask and that's enough karma for the government to continue their efforts."
70,43,They just vaccinate you when you wear a mask and they just don't have to.
70,54,"I would say it’s a good idea, but it's not likely that they will actually take the effort to prevent this by allowing people with no medical knowledge to travel to the airports if they can’t afford it."
70,64,"Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a huge difference, and can be abused."
93,70,"This is kind of funny. You imply a virus does not go away, but the person who makes it is not going to be in that funk."
95,70,"Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. Is this a joke? Because if I was a teenager and they say that a man wearing a mask isn't a joke, then they're just doing shit."
70,6,A lot of people still wear a mask and that's enough karma for the government to continue their efforts.
70,21,"Why should you want to go to the airport with your mask on and the mask on? I'm glad I went, but I'm more concerned about getting sick if I'm not doing anything to prevent more fatality in my country."
70,22,"I think the whole thing is a joke. You've already got your facts wrong. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.

70,24,It's a joke. The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time. I think it's pretty obvious the government will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus.
70,27,It's just a joke.
70,34,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government.
70,43,So this guy isn't going to be able to make a joke on us? What would he say if he was in a funk? Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. Is this a joke? Because if I was a funk?
70,54,"If you were a teenager and they say that a man wearing a mask isn't a joke, then they're just doing shit."
70,64,I’ve been told that a man wearing a mask isn’t a joke. I can’t help but wonder if he’s actually sick.
93,70,"I haven't seen this movie, and I'm just going to say, ""I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus or even a virus is a joke in itself. I think this is kind of funny. If someone were wearing a mask on a run then they are putting themselves at risk, a joke can be made, but the actual joke isn't funny."
95,70,"I read a little about this and I was amazed to see it, it doesn't even have any relevance to the subject at all. It’s kind of like that for some kids.

70,6,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the US government.
70,21,"So... we're going to say a few things about this, but then again, I don't know what exactly they're saying. Vaccination is one of the biggest health insurance problems of recent years - a combination of medication and therapy - and it isn't one of the least serious types of medicine. It's just a tool for figuring out how to prevent things from happening in your country."

70,24,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.
70,27,"The CDC has been taking this approach for many years now. They are implementing it in the hope that people will see what a real fucking joke it is, as it's a huge misconception that vaccines are a legitimate and incredibly bad idea."
70,34,I don't see the difference in the two parts here. Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them.
70,43,"> We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated.',"
70,54,The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time.

93,70,I'm a little confused by your title.
95,70,I don't know what they're referring to but I've read the title and know that it's a joke. It's a joke.
70,6,> The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time. I think it's pretty obvious the government will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus.
70,21,And Vaccination is one of the most useful types of medical treatment.
70,22,Vaccination is one of the biggest health insurance problems of recent years - a combination of medication and therapy - and it isn't one of the least serious types of medicine. It's just a tool for figuring out how to prevent things from happening in your country.
70,24,The CDC is taking the first step. But I'd still say they've been doing this for a long time. They just don't know how to prevent the spread of a virus.
70,27,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
70,34,It is actually a joke. The CDC will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus. It's just a joke.
70,43,I think it's a joke.
70,54,"Is it okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies?"
70,64,"As a parent with a family of two who would not have a life insurance policy, I can say this is a pretty good - if not the most interesting part."
93,70,"The article is misleading, and there is no tense sense in the title."
95,70,The CDC is the only one in the country that is actually going to be working in the next four decades to actually do what they can to stop the spread of a virus.
70,6,Vaccination is the only effective way to prevent a disease. Its the only thing that's allowed to work in the public interest is not to treat it at all. The most important thing is not to encroacher this message from the president.
70,21,"I’ve been here a couple of years and I still wear a mask when I go to the hospital with the same symptoms, so I know how that goes."
70,22,"I'm an immigrant in the country, I don't wear a mask in public. And I also don't wear it in public."
70,24,"A bit of humor is going on in this thread. This is the biggest deal if the government, health care, etc., wants to protect people."
70,27,"That's a joke. They don't want people to realize it, they want people to know that there's no need to get their kids vaccines and can't see it."
70,34,Yes. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign.
70,43,A great many people still wear masks when they work with people who don't have a health insurance.
70,54,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
70,64,The only part I can remember from the article is that I can only remember one word: 'It's a joke'.
93,70,No wonder the article is so overused and sarcastic.
95,70,I don't know what's wrong with a joke.
70,6,"I'm pretty sure I've never heard of people wearing masks in public, so it's not very common."
70,21,"It's not funny because if you are a Democrat, you have to admit that you don't know anything about a vaccine."
70,22,"The government can't tell that this is the kind of thing that people want to be doing. The government can't tell this to their staff, they cannot tell this to their doctors or their doctors."
70,24,I know that the CDC's role in preventing the spread of the deadly virus is to put a stop to fecal illness and not prevent the spread of the vaccine itself. The article is a sarcastic joke.
70,27,I'm a little confused. Is this an article or is this a remark of some kind?
70,34,"""The biggest deal if the government, health care, etc., wants to protect people. That's a joke."
70,43,I am glad you are not the only one who is a little too open and open to any form of public health care. You don't have to come out of your bed with some sort of mask when you come out.
70,54,">I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies?"
70,64,"Vaccination isn't a joke, but it is a warning sign. There's not much of a difference between a warning sign and a joke. The warning sign is a warning sign, that's all it is."
93,70,"IANAL. But santa doesn't wear a mask in the middle of his run. The only people in the community who do it, and the people who do it."
95,70,We're going to have to get vaccinated.
70,6,It's a joke because the most important thing is not to encroacher this message from the president. Is it a joke because the article is so overused and sarcastic?
70,21,It seems that the CDC has not actually published the details of the guideline - which is why they want to protect people from the disease.
70,22,"I can't even remember the article itself. I've never heard of people wearing masks in public, so I can't remember if I heard a sarcastic joke, but I did learn something new today."
70,24,There's so much that's wrong with the joke. It's funny and it's not a joke.
70,27,A lot of the other comments don't seem to seem to take place in the US.
70,34,"I don't understand how a joke works in the context of the article. There are a lot of people who wear a mask in the world, and don't really want to be in public. I don't get it at all."
70,43,"In my school district, everyone would have to wear a mask to keep kids from dying and getting sick, and when they went out they would always have to wear a mask - and it just ended up making them uncomfortable because they wanted to."
70,54,"I think the article is overused, sarcastic and the joke was utterly unfunny."
70,64,So they have to wear masks to stop people from getting sick? Well I don't know about it so I don't have a problem with it.
93,70,I'm not really a superhero. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.
95,70,"""I'm just trying to get all the kids to get vaccinated so we don't get sick or get sick. I also want kids to be vaccinated."
70,6,It's a joke because it is a warning sign.
70,21,What the heck is the difference between a sarcastic and a real joke?
70,22,"Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day.

70,24,I don't understand how the joke works in the context of the article. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.
70,27,Aww heh. That's so fucking hilarious.
70,34,"""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies? Vaccination isn't a joke, but it is a warning sign.

The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them."" ""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"""
70,43,It's an understatement and a joke. It sounds like you're comparing it to a joke that doesn't actually happen.
70,54,The only reason that the CDC has been doing this is because there are thousands of people who don't want to be in the public eye. But that doesn't make the article any less interesting or less interesting.
70,64,"... ""If you don't have a life insurance policy that isn't mandatory, you'll need a CDC AP license to fly at your airports without a mask if you want to use them in your business."""

70,21,"Vaccination is the one of the biggest health insurance problems of recent years and people i know are getting sick, not just people i know. It is still used to fight the disease because of it's effectiveness in preventing accidents. They aren't immune to it because they are going to be doing it."
70,22,It's an understatement and a joke.
70,24,This is one of the few times I've heard that joke before.
70,27,"""We're just trying to keep all the kids to get vaccinated so we don't get sick or get sick. I also want kids to be vaccinated."""
70,34,It's a joke because it is a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them.
70,43,"I've never heard of a government who wouldn't do it for medical reasons. I've heard that the ""I want to give a second thought, what's really the only thing about that?"" line is in my head and I still don't get it."
70,54,The only reason the article doesn't seem to be interesting is because a bunch of people have no idea what it's about or the type of thing they are addressing.
70,64,"The CDC would have to stop people from wearing a mask in their airports. It would make no sense to the CDC to want to prevent that type of epidemic. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a huge difference, and can be abused."
93,70,"That's a pretty edgy comment, if you ask me."
95,70,"The first word in a joke isn't a joke, it's a joke."

70,22,Vaccination is a medicine that is used to help prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccination is a vaccine.
70,24,"The article was published on March 6, 2017."
70,27,"Isn't that the CDC's position on a lot of things, specifically the people they're not dealing with? Because if it's the CDC's policy to stop children from getting sick, and you wear a mask, you can't go anywhere without a mask."
70,34,"There's no ""everyone should wear a mask"" in public, it's just that a mask is a necessity for protection from the spread of a virus."
70,43,"I just need to understand that I don't actually need a medical condition. I do not need medical services at all to vaccinate myself. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. Vaccination is a warning sign and is effective for preventing infections in the eyes, but it's still a warning sign."
70,54,"My parents always told me they would be scared to go in public but I got asked by a friend to tell me that it's not okay for them to wear a mask and that he would be uncomfortable in public because it would make them uncomfortable to do so, but it still seems like it's something they should do and have to do. We're getting to the point where they would be so uncomfortable, but they could use the chance to talk if they wanted."
70,64,I don't know what the CDC and CDC would do with a CDC license. I know that you'd find it funny if you wore a CDC AP license in public places.
93,70,"I can't tell if you're being serious or not, but I'm so angry about that. I am trying to figure out what you mean, though."
95,70,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,6,>[events] of people wearing a mask are not preventable. It is a medical treatment and a warning sign.

70,22,"It's the only way that a patient can get vaccinated. A lot of the time people will not wear a mask in public, which is an indication of a'scared of people' attitude towards it. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask, especially when you haven't been to the hospital in a while."
70,24,"So how do we get this joke to work? I know I'm not doing that, but it's actually quite funny and funny to say."
70,27,"In other words, I'm a kid."
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them.
70,43,I would be more scared if I were not in a funk.
70,54,I think this is really interesting.
70,64,I'd rather the government has a clearer definition of the word joke than just not doing it. It is one of the most interesting things we have ever read in our life.
93,70,I'm not talking about the movie. It's just about how everyone's reaction is to the movie.
95,70,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,6,This is all a big rant on here.
70,21,"Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and won't even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and won't even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and won't even know what to wear when they go in for the day."
70,22,"It is a sign of fear. I don't think anyone would believe me about it, but my parents had a friend who refused to help them so I was worried about the risk."
70,24,">Isn't that the CDC's position on a lot of things, specifically the people they're not dealing with? Because if it's the CDC's position on a lot of things, specifically the people they're not dealing with?"
70,27,"I believe the CDC has been experimenting with this strategy for years, and some people have been telling people that it's not a joke based on a joke they can't make. This is a legitimate and incredibly bad idea. The CDC should be making a clear decision about not making a joke based on this."
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick.
70,43,"I see this one too. What makes people believe the vaccination is a necessary evil? A ""fucking "" ""machete."" The doctor wants to be convinced that this is a health problem. And so, they've actually been doing it for many decades."
70,54,>... but it still seems like it's something they should do and have to do.
70,64,"I'm going to go read [it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination), and I'll give you a summary of some of the jokes I've been in."
93,70,OP's first question is: can I buy the movie? It's based on a book.
95,70,I think it's pretty clear from the title that they are trying to stop the spread of a virus to stop the spread of viruses. They're trying to keep the government from spreading it to a lot of people. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad.
70,6,"I can't believe that santa does not wear a mask in public, so it's not very common."", ""There are millions of us and it will cost millions to keep a mask on and prevent an outbreak and a relapse."", ""I'm pretty sure I've never heard of people wearing a mask in public, so it's not very common."", ""A lot of people still wear a mask and that's enough karma for the government to continue their efforts."", ""..."
70,21,Is it really that stupid that a lot of people still wear a mask?
70,22,"It's the government's job to make jokes out of those, which they want to make."
70,24,"Vaccination is a medical treatment, and it's not actually a joke. They are just trying to make the government look stupid and bad."
70,27,"I've actually been in an episode of ""Bear it and make the government look stupid and bad."" and ""If you don't have to wear a mask you shouldn't be in your flight."" It's pretty weird."
70,34,"""I don't get it at all."""
70,43,>A great many people still wear masks when they work with people who don't have a health insurance card.
70,54,It's all a joke.
70,64,"The movie was a great read. I am glad that the doctor is actually trying to make the message clear. The only thing i think about is the dangers of wearing a mask. I can't really agree with them with the wording, but it is just as silly to try to say anything that makes me sick that I don't even know how to do it."
93,70,I don't think this is a ripoff of the book.
95,70,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,6,"""I know the government, but they won't stop us from spreading it to a lot of people. They are just trying to make the government look stupid and bad. I think it's pretty obvious the CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government."""
70,21,Vaccination is the only way to stop a virus.
70,22,The article is based on the facts of the article. It was in the first page and the fact it was about vaccines is also part of the story.
70,24,A great many people still wear a mask when they work with people who don't have a health insurance card. It's all a joke. The only thing i think about is the dangers of wearing a mask. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,27,If we have a mandate of this we will be able to make it a requirement and make it the standard. But there are limitations on the government.
70,34,The CDC is trying to make the point that the idea that they should not be doing this is not a ripoff of the book.
70,43,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. Is this a ripoff of the book?
70,54,"So, that's a joke."
70,64,"I was very skeptical of what they were doing at the time, because I didn't have any idea what they were doing. It was like they were trying to force people to 'get it' because they didn't want to get sick. It's just that there are some people that don't get it."
93,70,This movie is a ripoff of the book.
95,70,Vaccination is not a joke.
70,6,>A great many people still wear a mask when they work with people who don't have a health insurance card.
70,21,"And as you said, the article was not about the CDC and that's what the article was about. The article is based on the facts of the book."
70,22,"Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy. It's basically just a rule governing the travel of people with health insurance cards. It's not a rule, but a warning sign. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day."
70,24,No one knows why it's a joke. They're just trying to keep everyone from having a hard time understanding / comprehending what they're talking about.
70,27,> Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,34,"If you want to see the movie, I suggest you get your health insurance card. I am not a doctor, so I don't have any sympathy for the CDC."
70,43,I think it's a great read that you're a little skeptical of the book.
70,54,">I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies?', ""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies?', ""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies?', ""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the joke."", ""I don"
70,64,"If it weren't for the government, he wouldn't have a job. He would have had an issue with it."
93,70,"Nope. Rather, he wants to make sure that the movie is a rip off of the book."
95,70,"The ""sweep a little, but a little bit of fun, and a bit of fun!"" joke is like the ""sweep a little, but a little bit of fun, and a bit of fun!"" joke."
70,6,"In the end, the government has a right to deny any chance they have to have a medical report on them."
70,21,Vaccination is a medicine. A new study that has been done to diagnose people has reported an increase in fatality due to the use of nephrotoxic drugs in the past year
70,22,I don't get this. I'm a lawyer and have had multiple doctors go on for some time. So this is all a joke.
70,24,"> ""The only thing i think about is the dangers of wearing a mask"
70,27,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
70,34,Is there anything funny about that?
70,43,"As much as the CDC has had a hard time letting people do this, it still's a joke."
70,54,The article is not a joke. It is a joke.
70,64,In the end it's not a joke. It's more of a warning sign than a joke.
93,70,"The book is good, but it's not the book."
95,70,This is a very different topic. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,6,"I have a friend with a vaccinated face who works for a private insurance company. She lives near a hospital and we both wear masks. We have a lot of vaccinated patients with no insurance and I've never seen them in person. It's just not the same as getting vaccinated, and I've never seen them. And I've heard it mentioned in an article about it a few times on here. I'm not sure how many of us actually care about them. We just want to make sure a safe way for people to"
70,21,"I can't understand why you're being so sarcastic and so rude. There are a million things they are saying, but it just really isn't that silly."
70,22,I don't think the article is all a joke.
70,24,"In addition to being a joke, this is just a joke."
70,27,Then the movie was a joke. It was a joke.
70,34,"Well, when you go to see the movie you aren't going to see a very good one. You will have no excuse."
70,43,It's not a joke. It's a joke. They're just trying to keep everyone from having a hard time understanding/comprehension of what they're talking about.
70,54,The article has no basis in fact for facts. It's just a joke and is not an actual fact.
70,64,"I don't like the term 'a joke', because it has a really long, complicated meaning."
93,70,That's not a rip off of the book.
95,70,So it's a joke?
70,6,The fact that this is a joke makes it sound like it's a joke.
70,21,I don't think this is a joke at all.
70,22,"It's not a joke. The article is a joke, but it isn't a joke. The article is just a joke. The CDC is trying to make a joke out of something a lot of people didn't know about."
70,24,"The phrase is ""We don't have to wear a mask to help stop the spread of the deadly virus."""
70,27,"The book says there is no need to get sick, so there is not much that can be done to protect the health of children."
70,34,I think you're being somewhat off-base when you say that the CDC is trying to make the point that the idea of not doing this is not a joke.
70,43,"In addition to being a joke, the article is a joke."
70,54,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,64,"In addition, I think the idea that the FDA should put a mask on someone is absurd. I would be interested in hearing this one."
93,70,"I think this is the first joke to ever come out of that book book titled: ""The book is a ripoff of the book. The whole joke is a ripoff of the book. The whole joke is a ripoff of the book."""
95,70,It’s funny because there are so many people who would think the government is not going to make a joke. This isn’t even a joke.
70,6,"Vaccination is an idea, and it's an effective way to prevent and prevent disease."
70,21,"Because it's just a joke. It's a joke that they've been meaning to make a joke about for years now, and that's just not a joke."
70,22,It's a joke.
70,24,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.
70,27,>I think the article is a joke.
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick.

When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. In addition, I think the article is a joke because it has a really long, complicated meaning. The word “Joke” has meaning, it isn’t a joke, it’s an abstract."
70,64,"I think the article is kind of misleading. You are not referring to a ""joke"" in the same sense you are referring to the ""joke"" in the same sense that a joke is a joke. It is the fact that the article is a joke, not the fact that it's just a joke."
93,70,"This is a rip off. The book is a ripoff. And you know it, when people tell the truth, they don't care what the book is about."

70,21,"Is there anything you mean by ""I'm getting sick, but I'm not sure if that's a joke,"" and ""What is that stupid that a million people still wear a mask?"""
70,22,"This is a ridiculous joke, and a joke. You know it."
70,24,"I'm very sorry you are being off-base. I really really should have said more, and then acted more sympathetic."
70,27,There's some kind of bias.
70,34,"I don't see how that is funny at all. That's funny. That's a joke. The CDC is trying to make a joke out of something a lot of people didn't know about. The phrase is ""We don't have to wear a mask to help stop the spread of the deadly virus."""
70,43,The way I phrased it was the article's title.
70,54,"In any event, I think a lot of people will come up with an example that might not be a joke."
70,64,"There are plenty of jokes in these kinds of cases and it's funny, but a joke doesn't mean a joke. A joke is the point of a joke, it means that the whole point of the joke is to not care about what people think. But this isn't a joke."
93,70,"This is a pretty edgy comment, if you ask me."
95,70,"[NAME] is a politician, and he's going to have a tough time sticking his neck in an argument with his own friends."
70,6,It's not a joke if you ask me. This is a joke and it sounds like a joke.
70,21,"So the first sentence of this story is a joke. You're a Democrat. You don't understand what I'm saying. I'm not sure what you mean by that. I think the entire joke is about people getting sick and getting sick, because they still haven't gotten vaccines. You're saying you're getting sick, and you don't care what you hear about this."
70,22,"A huge majority of Americans don't know what the vaccine is and it's used to treat some sort of a serious health condition. It is the kind of vaccine that doesn't make you sick. It can be used for a variety of different illnesses, like influenza, so you might be able to know the right doses."
70,24,"Yes, the article is a joke."
70,27,"I have a book. It's about a drug. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
70,34,"The joke is the one where ""I can see a little bit of the difference between me and the other person"", 'If you get sick, I'll have a cough and I have a headache, I won't have a cough'."
70,43,"It's also been a joke that the article makes a ""joke"" about it."
70,54,"The article, though not a joke, doesn't say that you should be wearing a mask. It says that you should wear a mask and not wear a mask in public, but you should not be wearing a mask in public."
70,64,I have a health insurance policy that requires a person to have a vaccinated life. I've been told this was a joke.
93,70,Is the movie a ripoff of the book? Because it's based on the book. The book is a ripoff of the book.
95,70,I can't believe we're not seeing a new virus in our mouths for a while now. There's only one way we can actually help people die - getting the vaccinated - is to take out a vaccine.
70,6,"The article isn't a joke, it's the idea of the government causing a problem for the people who work with people who have health insurance who want to protect them, the people who want to protect them and the people who want to protect them."
70,21,I'd take that as an insult to the CDC. The CDC is trying to make a joke out of something a lot of people didn't know about.
70,22,"As a CDC member, I'm more inclined to think it's a joke than a joke. It's a good deal better than I thought."
70,24,"I can tell you that the fact that you think it's a joke translates into something like ""I think it's funny, but i think it's a joke."""
70,27,">They want people to know that there is no need to get sick, so there is not much that can be done to protect the health of children."
70,34,"As I was speaking from personal experience, I think that a very interesting piece of evidence is that the article implies the person who is in need of vaccines wears the mask that he or she has got the vaccine."
70,43,"I’m a Democrat, and I’m a Democrat. I’ve heard this before but it doesn’t seem to be a joke, and I think it may be a bit funny. I do enjoy talking to my friends who I’m not sure if they agree."
70,54,I'm not really sure why people are downvoting anything. Is this really just the first time the CDC has been rewriting the story?
70,64,So the article was written to be a joke?
93,70,"I hate it when the article gets downvoted to hell. I hate it too. I don't want to make fun of it, because it's so un-descriptive. Whenever I find myself in the same place as an old man I'm going to make fun of myself for wanting to be a joke in my witty joking voice."
95,70,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke because people are trying to keep the government from doing anything to stop the spread of a virus.
70,6,A big deal about it is that if the people on the front line get sick of it and they are vaccinated then they should have some sort of sarcasm.
70,21,"This is very unreliable information. I am not sure if there is any evidence that it is true, but it would be the most likely one."
70,22,"Vaccination is a medical treatment. It's the kind of medicine that is used to treat some sort of serious illness, like influenza. It can be used for a variety of different illnesses, like influenza, so you might be able to know the right doses."

70,43,This is why I am still on reddit.
70,54,"It was written by one of my very old, masked friends. He doesn't want to talk about it and he wouldn't care about the joke, he just wants the kids to talk."
70,64,People who read the article would also be interested in this if they wanted to take advantage of the fact that the fact that the article isn't a joke is a joke. It's not a joke. The article isn't a joke. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad.
93,70,I read it once and it was a little sarcastic and didn't feel like it was a ripoff of the book.
95,70,"Vaccination is not a joke because it has nothing to do with a virus. It’s a joke because it has nothing to do with a vaccine. That’s how it is. There are some things that you can get vaccinated for, like the vaccines, but only in a handful of people."
70,6,"Vaccination is a vaccine, you can't protect people without it. The best and most effective way is to make sure that you don't get a virus. This is not a joke."
70,21,A couple of my friends at the hospital who were sick did not get vaccinated. I haven't even heard of it. I haven't even seen the book
70,22,I'm a lawyer and I don't wear a mask in public. I don't wear a mask when I go in the morning.
70,24,I'm a man vaccinated from a doctor and I thought this was a good joke.
70,27,The CDC has been trying to make the government look stupid and bad.

They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad."
70,43,A good joke? What’s wrong with that?
70,54,I don't think it's an obvious joke. It's one of the many things the CDC has been trying to show their audience.
70,64,"There are many, many things they've said that might be useful to people to understand, such as the warning sign of the flu, and the other side of the coin that the people who would not have a life insurance policy might not get."
93,70,Is the OP asking for a comment to change his mind?
95,70,It's the whole point of a joke.
70,6,This is why people like you are not allowed to do it.
70,21,I think it's just that there are some really good stories and it's not even going to be a real joke.
70,22,I've never heard of people wearing masks in public.
70,24,"As a lawyer, I can tell you that there is one thing the government should do. It's not to make people think bad, it's to protect them. If the government says it needs a warning sign or if it needs to be vaccinated then they don't have to have a mask on. The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government."
70,27,You can't go anywhere without a mask.
70,34,I don't have a good memory of when that happened. It was one of those things that I listened to a lot when I was younger.
70,43,A good joke. But I don't like the jokes.

70,64,"The article is pretty good. I am going to go read it(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination), and I'll give you a summary of some of the jokes I've been in.

I can’t really agree with them with the wording, but it is just as silly to try to make the joke."
93,70,"[Phrase 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles.png) is a good resource. It's a good resource, especially since the title says the entire story was inspired by the book."

70,54,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
70,64,"That's pretty hilarious. I think it's better than just saying, ""It's a joke."" Having a health insurance policy that's mandatory is the same as having a life insurance policy."
93,70,It's not a rip off of the book. It's a ripoff of the book.
95,70,"This is a joke, because the fact that it's a joke means a whole lot to you. It's a joke because it has nothing to do with a virus."
70,6,I think there is a problem with it. It's really a joke. It's a joke that the only way to prevent disease is to prevent people who get sick from it.
70,21,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. A new study has been done to diagnose people with a virus and to treat that virus.

70,24,"I'm a lawyer, but I don't think you're being a joke."
70,27,A lot of the things I listened to in my early 30s are a bit of a joke.
70,34,The jokes themselves are going to be stupid.
70,43,"This guy is making a really silly joke, and even though he's not on the list, he's an absolute nutjob. I would tell him to wear a mask if he wants to get sick or have an allergy and he doesn't really understand how to tell that."
70,54,"A few things I’ve seen have happened. A large number of people haven’t been to a doctor in years. Some don’t have a medical history, others don’t have a doctor who’s been to one or the other in their lives. Some people have a medical history, some don’t."
70,64,"If it was an a joke, then you should probably start going and examining the risks, so it’s the best course of action."
93,70,That's the op. He didn't mean that he thought it was a ripoff of the book. He said that he thought it was a ripoff of the book.
95,70,They want to save the lives of millions of people around the world.
70,6,"I am so sorry, this is just a big part of the story."
70,21,"I mean, what are they going to do about a government snooping in on vaccines?"
70,22,"I don't know what's the underlying problem in this situation. I'd rather live life, and live with people I'm a lawyer."
70,24,"Vaccination is a medical treatment, but it is not a joke."
70,27,"I was in the medical field when I got vaccines. It was a joke, but I never went out of my way to check in on a man's life without a mask. But it had the same kind of message. I think that's the best way to go if you're sick."
70,34,Why do people need to wear masks in the US when they are sick? Because it's not a good reason to wear a mask in the US?
70,43,I'd say that a lot of people have a hard time getting vaccinated because they don't know how to vaccinate themselves but that this is a joke.
70,54,"In the book, ""A few things I've seen have happened. A large number of people haven't been to a doctor in years. Some don't have a medical history, others don't have a doctor who's been to one or the other in their lives. Some people have a medical history, some don't have a doctor who's been to one or the other in their lives."""
70,64,This is pretty clear about this:
93,70,I think the book is a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book. The movie is based on the book.
95,70,It’s a joke because the government is working to prevent the spread of a virus.
70,6,"The article says this is a joke. Vaccination is not a joke, if you want to take part in this, it's a joke."
70,21,"In a new book about vaccinating people, it says that vaccines are important for preventative medical care because of their effectiveness in preventing the spread of the disease."
70,22,The article was about the actual danger of influenza.
70,24,You can't do this in your spare time. It's a joke. It's a joke.
70,27,You know what is so funny? I'm a medical student and I always wear a mask in the workplace and I can be vaccinated against all kinds of disease and I'm not immune to vaccines.
70,34,What's funny is that I heard that the only people with allergies have to wear masks to protect themselves from the disease. It's just a joke.
70,43,"I think that's a great read for a little while now. It's very well written, and if you think the article is a joke, I don't think the title is accurate, but I think the article is a good idea. I'm not sure whether the article has been really written in this way, but I feel like that's a good one."
70,54,"The article was written in the language of the author, so it is just a joke."
70,64,A lot of people don't have insurance and don't have health insurance but they do have a lot of insurance and have a lot of insurance and don't really get sick. The most common reason is that the person with the mask would not be on the list if they had insurance. Having a health insurance policy that doesn't require a mask is just as silly.
93,70,"I think the OP is making a great point about the movie and not the book, though. The whole book thing seems like it's a ripoff of the book. I'm not sure what you mean by that."
95,70,A lot of people are just not taking responsibility for the public health issues.
70,6,The people who are wearing masks are trying to be anti-vaccinating. The people who are trying to prevent people from getting sick aren't those people.
70,21,I think this is one of the things that gets sarcasm at times. It's not really about being a joke.
70,22,">We're being able to prevent a lot of things from happening in our country, and I'm worried about the risk of influenza."
70,24,"It is a joke, but I don't think it's just a joke. I think a lot of people who want to have a vaccine wear a mask and they are doing it on the spot. The thing is that when people do it, a lot of people think it's a joke, and they aren't doing it to the extent that it makes them think they are better than the other ones, but because they don't have a medical record, they are just not taking a risk."
70,27,You are correct in the ad you aren't talking about the government and you're wrong.
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. It is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick.
70,43,I think this is a very good example of what the Obama administration is doing in regard to the issue of getting vaccines. It is a joke.
70,54,A lot of people are retweeting a book about vaccines and the CDC has been doing this.
70,64,"Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a huge difference, and can be abused."
93,70,"[In the movie, the story is based on the book. The book is based on the book."
95,70,This is a joke because of the government. This is not a joke because it has nothing to do with a virus.
70,6,"In the book, I also read an article about how the Obama administration is trying to use the vaccines as a joke to avoid a lot of the trolls."
70,21,The point of the book is that vaccines are important in preventing the spread of influenza. Vaccination is not a joke at all. I think the article is just a joke.
70,22,"This is not a joke. This is a joke, this is a joke. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It is a medicine and a warning sign. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask when they go out of the country, but"
70,24,> Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.
70,27,"You are being a joke, not a joke."
70,34,The joke is not a joke. The joke is a joke.
70,43,"It's a good joke, but it's not a joke."
70,54,[[Butterfly](http://www.butterfly.com/tc/fossil_a_hitch_a_hitch) is a good summary of an article about a public health issue.
70,64,"""There's not much of a difference between a warning sign and a joke."""
93,70,"I'm a rip off of the book, but I think the quote is hilarious."
95,70,I don't see a lot of sarcasm and irritation here.
70,6,I think the joke isn't a joke because of the government. It is just a joke.
70,21,"I think the joke is, in fact, funny."
70,22,"I know it is not a joke and I am sorry to be rude but the article was about a joke about a joke that was based on facts and is based on facts and a joke is based on a joke, and the headline was about a joke"
70,24,"I don't think you have heard that before, and I'm not sure that you're being a joke at all."
70,27,Vaccination is the only thing you can do to prevent any illness or sickness.
70,34,"What's funny is that the article is the title of a book, but I thought it was written for a joke."
70,43,">The joke is a joke, but it's not a joke. It’s a joke, but it’s not a joke."
70,54,It's not a joke. It's a joke because the government isn't.
70,64,I was asked this last week if I could read the story in my head.
93,70,I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.
95,70,"As a politician, I think you're right, and I also think that this is a joke because it is actually a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections."
70,6,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a medical treatment and a warning sign. It is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent and prevent people from dying and getting sick.
70,21,"As a lawyer, you can't make a joke. The problem with this is that it has no scientific basis. People want to protect their lives, and the CDC hasn't, and this is an immoral joke, it's a joke, and it's funny."
70,22,I think the article is very poorly written. If you read the whole thing it could become a little more flimsy.
70,24,I am a doctor. Vaccination is a treatment and a warning sign. It is a medicine and a warning sign. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.
70,27,I thought this was just about how it was going to look like the CDC and how it was promoting a joke about vaccination?
70,34,I am trying to find a way to say that the joke is being funny. I think that is hilarious.
70,43,It’s a joke.
70,54,"I am very thankful for this post, because it shows that the people who actually need it are actually very intelligent people."
70,64,"I believe that the people on the list who don't get vaccines in their own country are going to have an actual problem with them because of this information, as well as the fact that the person in the article is not going to be covered by their life insurance and the fact that the fact that the CDC doesn't have a ""medical"" policy that protects the public from their own disease that it doesn't help at all. The CDC should give people the choice of what to wear but what they can't afford to do with a health insurance policy."
93,70,"I'm not sure if he's being sarcastic or not, but he's being sarcastic."
95,70,It's a joke because it's in the headline and doesn't have a way of saying it. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus.
70,6,">The problem with this is that it has no scientific basis. People want to protect their lives, and the CDC doesn't,"
70,21,"It's been reported that the disease has increased significantly, and that's a reason why people wear a mask for the rest of their lives - for example if they haven't yet. So that's why they need to do it."
70,22,"Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day. As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day."
70,24,'I think I'm being a joke at all. I think this is a joke because they are trying to make the government look stupid and bad.'
70,27,"I think if you have any experience with any of these things, a friend of mine whose job is to get the vaccine in a certain state will get some familiarity with it, and you aren't going to know if it is a joke or not. The one thing I didn't know at all was that you are going to get a full head of the way."
70,34,"Yes. And yes, I've been to the CDC. It seems to me that it's the only medical device to prevent disease. A mask has a very strong safety feature."
70,43,"In this case, the CDC should probably be letting people get vaccinations. There are actually good things to vaccinate everyone, and they need to stop that. They shouldn't do that when it's a joke, but they should probably stop the problem and let people go for it."
70,54,A woman should be able to wear a mask in public if they don't have a medical history.
70,64,There's more to the joke than just telling a joke.
93,70,'I'm a little confused by your title.
95,70,"I can't imagine how the government would get in such a short time, like when they're trying to stop a virus and then have to smack people with their lips. But the way you speak of it, the joke makes no sense."
70,6,I thought it was a joke.
70,21,It is the best way to protect your life.
70,22,It's not a joke. It's a joke. The government needs to have a reason to be able to make a joke about people getting vaccines.
70,24,It's a joke because the CDC didn't write it out to make people think they could stop spreading a virus.
70,27,Is there a way to put that in the headline? Because I'm not sure I've read any of these things.
70,34,"You could use the sentence, ""The problem with this is that it has no scientific basis. People want to protect their lives, and the CDC doesn't. It's been reported that the disease has increased significantly, and that's a reason why people wear a mask in public - but I think that's just a joke."
70,43,"The joke isn't ""a joke"" but ""a joke."""
70,54,"I don't know why I get downvotes, but my mother is being downvoted."
70,64,It's a joke. If the CDC had an obligation to protect them then it would be a joke. The CDC would essentially prevent a virus from spreading in the US from the CDC or in Canada. That's not a joke.
93,70,The rapist is talking about the movie that makes it ripoff of the book.
95,70,I like this. It's a joke.
70,6,"The article was actually a joke, I just thought it was funny."
70,21,So when it goes down to it.. It’s a joke. It doesn’t mean it’s a joke.
70,22,The article doesn't state it's a joke. It just states it's a joke.
70,24,"It is a joke, but it is not a joke."
70,27,You don't have to wear a mask if you're traveling to US airports.
70,34,"I can't see why they'd want to be able to make a joke. If they had a health insurance card, they could have."
70,43,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a fucking warning sign.
70,54,>The article isn't a joke. It's just a joke.
70,64,"""Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's a huge difference, and can be abused."""
93,70,A bunch of people rip off the book so that they can have food and see the sanity of the world around them.
95,70,A joke is a joke that is about a'really' awful idea that we're making up. A joke is a joke because there's a real difference between it and a joke.
70,6,"No, it's a joke, not a joke. But a joke is a joke because it's not really a joke."
70,21,This is a very common joke. Vaccination is the best way to protect the sick from getting sick.
70,22,"I've written a couple articles about Vaccination, but none that I really want to discuss."
70,24,The joke is the word. It says 'to make people think bad'. But it's just a joke. The joke is a joke because the CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government.
70,27,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. It's not a joke.
70,34,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
70,43,I feel like the question of whether a joke is a joke is beyond the scope of this article.
70,54,There is a big difference between a 'Joke' and a 'Joke'. Is it the actual point of the article to go from 'joke' to 'joke'?
70,64,It doesn’t matter whether you want a CDC policy or not. You’re going to have a headache from having to carry a mask in front of your mouth. It should also be a joke.
93,70,In one of my favorite posts (I'm a big fan of the book. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.) I think this movie is one of those ripoffs of a book.
95,70,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.

70,21,>The article doesn't state it's a joke. It just states it's a joke.
70,22,"As far as I'm concerned, I'm gonna give the reader a courtesy warning: if you're traveling and don't wear a mask if you don't know what to do, then it's a joke, but you can't rig the whole thing to a joke."
70,24,I know that the CDC isn't the only one in the nation that is trying to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. They're trying to keep people from having a hard time understanding / comprehending what they're talking about.
70,27,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a treatment and a warning sign. It's a joke because it's a joke and a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
70,34,"In the context of the book, I believe the joke was a joke, not a joke, but a joke. It was the idea that the CDC wanted to create an atmosphere of a joke to avoid the health care issues. That's what happened, and that's how a joke works."
70,43,It's a joke because the CDC doesn't even say that 'you're wearing a mask if you go to the airport'.
70,54,"The word ""joke"" isn't the exact meaning of ""joke,"" it's the way they phrase it. It's the context of the article, which is a big part of why it isn't a joke."
70,64,And the CDC wouldn't be doing that without it.
93,70,"It's called ""Miracles"" and is about the idea of people having a place to look in the book."
95,70,"""I am looking forward to seeing more vaccination in the country, we need a better, more comprehensive approach to the topic,"" says the man he's talking about. ""We need to talk about the current vaccinations and how they are going to work to stop the spread of viruses."""
70,6,"I don't know where you're coming from. But, i read a bit of the book and I don't really understand why someone's opinion has no basis in the book."
70,21,"> I think the whole thing is about people getting sick and getting sick, because they still haven't gotten vaccinated. I mean, I’m getting sick, but I don’t care what you hear about this."
70,22,"You think that's a joke, right? The headline would say that you haven't heard of people using the vaccine. But, I feel like that's how it's used."
70,24,"It's a joke that carries more weight than a mask in the body, but is not a joke."
70,27,>I think this article is one of those ripoffs of a book.
70,34,This is all the CDC wants out of this article. It's the only one I've read.
70,43,"In that book, it says the doctor is a joke that ""The President is going to be talking about vaccination for a long time, and then to talk about what the CDC should do. The man is saying the doctors are wrong and to talk about the problem""."
70,54,"I can't say it's not a joke, it's about the government working hard to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's just a joke."
70,64,"I don't know if you are kidding me, but this is about a joke."
93,70,That is a very funny title. It's not a joke.
95,70,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,6,"Well, it was fun to think of it. I had to go through the same book twice. One of the things I love about this book is the idea that the CDC are trying to prevent a disease from spreading. The CDC can't possibly put an end to that and I don't know why that is possible."
70,21,"So in the headline, you're saying ""..."
70,22,"The headline doesn't state a joke, but it says that 'I don't think it's a joke, but I feel like that's how it's used. It's a joke because it's about the government working hard to prevent the spread of the virus."
70,24,>I think it's a joke because the CDC is trying to make the government look stupid and bad.
70,27,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a treatment and a warning sign.
70,34,It's a joke because it's the only way to protect people from getting sick and getting sick.
70,43,The word 'joke' is a joke. This is a joke.
70,54,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's a treatment and a warning sign. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
70,64,"I don't know why I didn't read the CDC book ""Miracles"". It is a very interesting book."
93,70,"I'm not sure if this is really an answer to what you're asking, but it may be appropriate."
95,70,You're a joke.
70,6,"The ""President"" is saying if you want to protect people from getting sick, you can have your face on your face. If it's a joke, you can have your face on your face.

70,24,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
70,27,This is the only article I read on the subject about vaccination.
70,34,">I don't get it at all. I don't even want to make this sound like a good news story. The world has moved on from the world without vaccines, and a lot of people who have vaccinated themselves and have been vaccinated do not think the danger is worth the cost and inconvenience."
70,43,">What makes people believe the vaccine is a necessary evil? A ""fucking "" ""machete."" The doctor wants to be convinced that this is a health problem. And so, they've actually been doing it for many decades."
70,54,"I'm not sure if it's a joke. I've had the experience of reading a book about this, and I can tell you that it's not a joke either."
70,64,"It's not a joke at all. It's a joke because it's a joke and a joke because the joke isn't in the article. It isn't a joke, it's a joke."
93,70,>In one of my favorite posts (I'm an avid reader and it sounds like a lot of people get upset when they see a movie and they take it as a ripoff of the book.

70,22,I grew up in a different country and still do. I grew up in an area that had an era where the government was not the only government whose job was to prevent the spread of the virus.
70,24,"In a way, the phrase ""I'm being a joke"" is a joke."
70,27,So there's the joke.
70,34,"I'm not a doctor. But the joke is a joke. The CDC is trying to make the point that a joke is just a joke. The joke isn't a joke, the headline is a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke because it has no relevant connection to the subject."
70,43,I’m gonna start with a question. Why does the CDC care so much for vaccines?
70,54,"I'm not going to make a joke about vaccination, but it does sound to me like the headline of the article is something to think about."
70,64,The new FDA rule does not apply to any form of health care. It only applies to certain types of health insurance.
93,70,I don't see any reason to get upset about it.
95,70,A very relevant question here is whether this is a joke or not: why is this so much a joke? It’s a joke.
70,6,"It's an enlightening book. It sounds like a joke, and that's exactly how a joke works."

70,27,You don't need a mask in your country. I'd be more concerned about you and the kids if you didn't get vaccines.
70,34,"That's a big difference between a ripoff and a joke. It's a joke, as in, a joke. It's a joke because it has no connection to the subject. The CDC is trying to make the point that a joke is a joke, but it's just a joke. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."
