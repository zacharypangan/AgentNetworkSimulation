38,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,10,I think you should wear a mask
38,11,My brother and I are in FL now. We both wear masks when we aren't going out.
38,16,"It's really weird that the government wants to keep a mask on for any other reason but to prevent the spread of a virus, because it's also because they want the government to prevent such things."
38,18,What's the problem with wearing a mask in a workplace?
38,22,"I don't want to get taken out by the government. My family is scared of him, and I don't even want to be in the room. I want to be the bad guy."
38,25,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus :(
38,26,This is a good place to ask if a guy who has a family is in any way at fault for wearing a mask.
38,27,A virulent illness can be a deadly virus. Wearing a mask in public can be a form of anti-viral treatment.

78,38,i went on a run in texas recently and i had never heard of this before. how did you know you had to wear a mask in this event?
80,38,"Nope, just a little bit of advice. You should wear a mask to protect yourself from getting sick. I'm a bit ashamed of myself for wearing my face mask."
86,38,"It was pretty obvious for me that people who were infested by rabid Virulent Viruses didn't have a medical need to wear a mask outside, as they were bringing the virus outside to stop their virus being spread."
87,38,"Well, i have to ask my doctor."
88,38,I can't believe I ran around a virus that wasn't gone.I had the same reaction with the other guy in that pic.I wasn't sure what it was.
38,1,If I remember right it's because a guy is wearing a mask when he's sick and wants to wear it if it is on.
38,6,This seems like the ol'way to make someone else's head hurt.
38,9,I think you should wear a mask.
38,10,"This is the correct answer. It's like ""I'll take it on and get my friend to go and see if my family will be okay with me wearing a mask"", not ""I'll take it on and see if my family will be okay with me going out""."

38,22,People who are afraid of getting infected with a virus are a liar.
38,25,"In the meantime, you should not be able to wear a mask in public. A man who didn't wear a mask a week before the last day of work was going to be able to go home. I don't want to leave. I don't want to be able to go, or get in a position where I can't see his face."
38,26,Having a job as a federal agent has a lot to do with my mental health.
38,27,"I don't think it has anything to do with ""suicide prevention."" The fact that the government doesn't know how to prevent the spread of a virus is indicative of what a virus is. I believe the ""suicide prevention"" thing is a part of the effort."

54,38,"I have a hard time believing in a woman's right to wear a mask on a job trip. If there is only one answer, why does she wear a mask, regardless of what she's wearing? If not, I would love to be with her if she was willing to wear a mask and keep distance. I would just be a little upset that she doesn't wear it to work. If she gets sick, then why do she wear a mask if she's already running?"
73,38,"I know what you mean, but you're a pedophile and he would not have done it if he did that."
78,38,"I've been wearing a mask for a few years. I wore a mask once and was taken out of the hospital with a virus. It hurt like a fucking bat. I've never had an infection, but a few days ago a couple of people in my department thought my bf was going to throw it in a bucket and they had to take it off. I said he couldn't do that and said that I was going to wear it when he left and was able to make it out. They're trying to "
80,38,I'm going to try and write a letter addressing this on my hand.
86,38,People that have been infested with virulent viruses in the past are still very sick and it is very hard to keep an eye on that. I would try wearing a mask or helmet while getting infected.
87,38,My mother's daughter was vaccinated when she was 16.
88,38,"I'm not a doctor. I don't want to be taken out by a virus that isn't gone, but I do want people to be informed."
38,1,"I don't see how it's a good thing that you've never been infected with a virus. It's a scary virus, and you can't really make a deal out of it. I know that if you get infected, you need a hospital scarves to help you avoid it."
38,6,Is your mother still alive? How do you feel about that?
38,9,I was a federal agent for years. This was only a couple of years back and I was still in a mask.
38,10,I'm glad that I know who you are.
38,11,"Yes, wearing a mask in public can help stop the spread of a virus. But a mask and some masks are needed to stop it. The federal government does not have any laws against this so it's kind of a fucking bad idea to wear a mask. Especially when you're getting an infection."
38,16,The federal government doesn't know how to prevent the spread of a virus. This is the correct answer.

38,27,"I'm sorry to hear about your pain. That's a very common situation for a female in a relationship. I don't think it's normal to want someone to have a physical scare and be sick, but I understand why this person's reaction was such a long-term thing to do."
38,28,"I'm not sure I like the idea of a pedophile in a situation where the public knows a virus is spreading because they haven't been vaccinated yet, but I really doubt the people you spoke to have a problem with the virus being spread."
41,38,"I don't understand why people are still using a ""spy"" label to describe the type of behavior people are doing."
48,38,I don't have a mask and I am sure there is a way to make it happen.
49,38,I think it's a very good thing they have taken this measure to stop the spread of a virus.

73,38,"This is a real problem. You know, in Texas. This is the only problem."
78,38,So you got sick and went to the hospital?
80,38,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
86,38,"It can be used as a way to stop the spread of a virus. It also has a 'proof of infection' to prevent it from being spread in public if it is infected, so if you want to stop it, you should check to see if it is spread outside in the first place."
87,38,I haven't seen anyone tell me that people who have had their children vaccinated have the virus.
88,38,"It’s a red flag for the government. You have to be prepared to run on people's hands and be prepared for other people. I’m sorry Mark, but I’ve seen a virus on my hand. The fact that you are not in the US shows a lot of potential danger here."
38,1,What is the'spy' label?
38,6,"It's actually a ""bad"" idea to wear a mask. It doesn't make sense to put the person's eyes on the other person's face and make them look sick."
38,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,10,I want to say that I'm glad that the government took the initiative to help.
38,11,"Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile and you are not going to stop the spread of a virus. It's a red flag for the government."
38,16,"I would be hesitant to wear a mask since it would be one way to stop a virus from spreading. In fact, I wouldn't recommend it."
38,18,"I don't understand what the term ""the bad guy"" means. I'm in a relationship with a woman and have her sickly stomachs filled with HIV. And when I say ""people who are afraid of getting infected with a virus are a liar,"" I mean, the term ""people who are afraid of getting infected with a virus are a liar."" But my apologies, Mark."
38,22,"If you get sick, you should not wear a mask. I've seen it on a woman in Texas. She could not go there. That's a lot to worry about and is a big red flag."
38,25,"In order for this CDC to prevent this, we have to wear a protective clothing when the symptoms appear and prevent people from getting infected. Its not ""assailant"" that these people are being abused. And it is not something that is ""assailant"". There is no reason to be in a public place when someone is being sick."
38,26,I read the comments in r/AwfulAddiction.

49,38,"I think a few other comments can help give you a better idea of how to treat your mother's flu. It's not a joke, it's just not the right thing to do. I don't want to be called an asshole, but it's definitely not a joke."
51,38,"That's the joke. The CIA is also making a sweeping, infrequent, insidious, and misleading statement. And you are not doing anything about it."
54,38,He's right to wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading to a person who's infected. Isn't this part of a vaccination policy?
73,38,"In fact, there is a real problem. A statewide mask mandate. You can see a boy on a plane without a mask, and if you're not wearing a mask, you're not a pedophile."
78,38,I'm not sure I'd be able to do it because of my age and I do not have an insurance doc who will work with me for this.

38,22,i always think this joke is hilarious.
38,25,What a joke. I would be very mad if I got a virus... I'd say a mask is not in the bill of rights.
38,26,"Vaccines are for life. It's a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated."
38,27,Yes. And they can. Not all. So you're going to have to wear a mask in public. Then if you are a pedophile you're gonna go all out to get it and don't go.

49,38,"There is only one possible way to prevent flu, and that is not to say that you're being stupid."
51,38,"It's not about making jokes about the government, it's about letting people do what is safe. There's a lot of crazy and naive things on Facebook."
54,38,The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time. It's so simple and simple that it makes it a lot easier to get around without it.

80,38,What are you referring to if you think the government doesn’t need more fads.
86,38,You're an abolitionist who grew up as a vaccinatarian. Is that a joke?
87,38,"I think this is kind of crazy. There are lots of people who think AMAs aren't about the health of their children, and aren't about the CDC or any other government body. If you ask me, my parents will say 'hey I think it's a good idea'. I think a lot of people get vaccinated, if not all, they have the right to say."
88,38,"CANNOTANSWER – I think it's pretty odd to me how many people realize that this is about the government's actions in preventing HIV in the country. I'm so sorry, but I'm also a medic. I'm a doctor. It's ridiculous."

38,10,"Yes, and that is an important reason. Vaccines are a human right that's a very, very basic human right. If you are a pedophile and your friend doesn't want to see this, you should not have a helmet."
38,11,"It's not really a joke, it's just that people use a lot of words in their post to yell at the government, and it's a bad idea."
38,16,"In fact, I'm not sure what you're thinking. Vaccines can be expensive, but the government carries out a huge majority of vaccination programs."
38,18,"OP, if you read this, it sounds like you're on the wrong page of the article."
38,22,"I don’t think we need a government that makes a lot of noise about this. Vaccines aren’t a right. They aren’t about the health of our children. They aren’t about the welfare of our children, they’re about the human rights of our citizens."

38,27,A lot of Americans are stupid and apathetic about the government.
38,28,"Well, it is the government's responsibility to prevent the spread of HIV. That's the problem."
41,38,"I don't know what the heck you mean. I mean, I know I know that if you don't wear a mask when you are sick, then you should know that if you aren't wearing a mask - but you don't want to be there when someone else does. I think the same goes for everyone, and yes, it's a joke."
48,38,I can't help but think of an idea that would make a santa a joke in its own right.
49,38,"I think you were actually infected and went to a number of clinics. I was actually infected and was going to get vaccinated and the doctor didn't even know. I don't want to be called an asshole, but it's definitely not a joke."
51,38,The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus.
54,38,"""I would love to be with her if she was willing to wear a mask and keep distance."""
73,38,The NSA is redistributing aid to every single person in Texas. It's an unpopular opinion that can get people scared of the government.
78,38,I love the film The Man in the Hat. There's so much more to it than that. It's just so eerily similar to a good movie.
80,38,"That doesn't work. People with HIV just want to be protected against them, not a government."
86,38,If you like to go to the AMA it's best to take your mom and your brother to the doctor.
87,38,It's not a joke. It's about how they feel about the government not wanting to get their kids vaccinated. And it's about what they can do to help them and how they can keep their children in line.
88,38,"[...It's a joke, the CDC is doing a great job on that issue. It's a slang term for a joke, but I don't think anyone would even use that."
38,1,"Well, it's a joke. It's just that people use a lot of words in their post to yell at the government."
38,6,Vaccines are for life. If I'm allergic to a virus I don't want to get a vaccine.
38,9,"My uncle told me that if I didn't wear a mask when he was sick and my wife didn't come home, the doctor would find a sex act with me. He said, 'Mama, do you have a face?'."

38,26,>We're on the same page.
38,27,I'm actually a few days into my new job.
38,28,Vaccines are not a human right.
41,38,Vaccines are not illegal. They are just not necessary - if your employer gives you a mask it will only make you sick if you have the correct vaccinations - not for the sake of public health. And then that mask won't help you.
48,38,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
49,38,I figured it would be a bit off - i do not know why people would be embarrassed.
51,38,"This post is an example of the type of racism that happens when people use a ""saber mask"" to scare off others when they see a ""saber"" as being a joke. It's actually pretty funny that a mask is being used to scare people when they don't want to sneeze at them."
54,38,Vaccination isn't a necessity in our country.
73,38,There is a big problem that a lot of people are asking about. There is a big problem in how people treat the sick in order to prevent it. If you don't want to go to that point in time you'll be dead.
78,38,I'm not sure it was a joke or a joke to you. I thought the one about the government's failure to prevent the spread of a virus was kinda stupid.
80,38,"I think it’s an interesting fact. Besides, the CDC is attempting to get rid of the fad."
86,38,People a vaccinate them.
87,38,People wear hooded masks in the AMA to prevent their children from getting the vaccine.
88,38,"As a medic, I’d say we’re very much in the same boat with the government."
38,1,The joke is that people are not being fair about the dangers of the government because they believe the government is a threat to public health.
38,6,Is this not a joke?
38,9,"[Hey, I've been in a hospital for several weeks now. We've given a few people a new mask because I was very worried about their medical condition. I think that's a great idea, but why do you want to try and tell me what that is like if you don't have a mask?]"
38,10,Isn’t it great how you can see people who need to take a mask or a mask to help people who need to get vaccinated.
38,11,"Vaccines aren't a human right. Vaccines are for life. It's a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated."
38,16,I think we are on the same page with the government.
38,18,That's an interesting and very sarcastic article. The person who wrote it is a pedophile.
38,22,Vaccines are not illegal. They are just not necessary.
38,25,Vaccines are for life. They are just not necessary - if your employer gives you a mask it will only make you sick if you have the correct vaccinations - not for the sake of public health.
38,26,"As someone who hasn't been to the AMA and walked into my job for the first time in years, this is really not a joke or a joke. But you’re on the same page with me."
38,27,No one is being racist. The CDC has nothing to do with vaccines.
38,28,"It's not a human right to not be vaccinated, it's a human right to not be vaccinated."
41,38,"Vaccines are not illegal. They are just not necessary - if your employer gives you a mask it will only make you sick if you have the correct vaccinations - not for the sake of public health. And then that mask won't help you. If you see an AMA, you're describing the AMA in a more rational way."
48,38,It's one of the few things I can think of that makes sense in context.
49,38,It's a joke. Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the virus.
51,38,i think that this is a very interesting read that has a lot of very interesting points.
54,38,I thought this was a joke as well. What did he say he was going to say?
73,38,I didn't read the whole article. I just wanted to put it this way:
78,38,"You think the idea that ""a man in a hat was a ripoff of the book?"" sounds cool. And I agree with you there, you would have a great time with your kids if you knew your bf was going to throw it in a bucket to get out and he didn't. I feel bad for him and his wife for not knowing how to do that."
80,38,"It's an old joke, but it's true."
86,38,"A bunch of people are asking ""Why are you not trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening?"""
87,38,"I’m gonna go to school to learn the alphabet, and then I will be a teacher and I will be an AMA expert on vaccination and that’s the joke."
88,38,You are just making me think you should leave your fucking mask at home while you are away from the CDC and go to the hospital if it is possible to stay at home. Then it is time to go to your fucking doctor and fuck yourself with your mask.
38,1,"I'm sorry but the joke is a joke that is a joke because people are telling shit and it's a joke. You just made me think that a man in a hat would have gotten a doctor in the face and a sicker person would throw their hat in the bucket and a person would throw it in a bucket, and then you would have got to go and find out who the doctor was and have a doctor who will try to take it down."
38,6,The article is about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. They are on the same page with the government.
38,9,"Vaccines are for life, not just to help with the disease."
38,10,"Well, it's a joke. I don't think the government is trying to stop it. It's basically trying to get rid of it. If a man in a hat is going to throw the stuff in a bucket, I'm not surprised he didn't. I don't think that's the only way to stop it."
38,11,A man in a hat was a ripoff of the book?
38,16,This is all part of a larger post...
38,18,Vaccines are not illegal. It's for life.
38,22,I’m gonna a friend who inherited a vaccine in the past and he was a big one. I got a shitload of his health problems from that.
38,25,[The article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/027-the-post_a_mashing_a_fuck_a_racial_assault-on-mom-hat/) is the only thing that hasn't been read by a third party. The article is based on a book and it's not an article.
38,26,Is it really a joke?
38,27,No one is racist. The CDC has nothing to do with vaccines. It's not a human right to not be vaccinated. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
38,28,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,38,Vaccines are the best thing to do because it is a public health issue.
48,38,"I mean, I’m not going to pretend to be a fucking scumbag. But to me I think if you are a troll in the bizarro sense of what I said, I’m going to be the person that would be the one that made me laugh so hard."
49,38,It's a joke because the government is bringing it out of the closet and then putting it back in the closet to help people. But no one is going to be the apologist for that.
51,38,"I think you don't understand this at all. It's just a bad joke. The CDC is making a statement like ""... and I don't even think you should read the original article."""
54,38,"I don't know about other people, but the people who were slammed for this are all doing it as a joke. That's a joke."
73,38,I read the whole article to find that the statewide mask mandate that is being re-enacted by the administration doesn't make any sense.
78,38,I just wanted to tell you that I don't think this is funny or a joke.
80,38,"This post is not funny, it's a joke."
86,38,The AMA is an interesting exercise. It's an exercise in how to understand the situation and explain the issues.
87,38,People wear masks in the AMA to prevent their children from getting the vaccine.
88,38,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
38,1,Vaccines are illegal because they help prevent the spread of the disease.
38,6,I think the article is too obvious that we should be addressing this issue.
38,9,This is not funny. This is ridiculous. I feel like this is a bit tainted by how it was written:
38,10,This is not funny. This is what you apologise for.
38,11,"> We all need to wear masks when we aren't going out."", ""We all need to wear masks when we're not going out."", """
38,16,I wouldn't recommend it.
38,18,"And in my opinion, there is nothing funny about that. What you're saying is that a lot of the information that you have is very wrong."
38,22,"This is why everyone should be on Twitter, so I can comment that they do not understand what the article says. Apparently, this is one of those times."
38,25,"So what, if I get a hat and my coworker 'helps' me with a virus. He's the one getting the hat."
38,26,So the AMA is an interesting exercise. It's an exercise in how to understand the situation and explain the issues.
38,27,"If you want to stop the spread of a virus, you need to wear a mask."
38,28,"The CDC has absolutely nothing to do with vaccines, but they are reenacting a mask mandate in order to help people get the virus. That's not the point."
41,38,Why is it not the best thing to do because it is a public health issue?
48,38,"The joke is, ""... and I’m sure there is a way to make it happen."" I think you are talking about a joke, not a joke. The joke is about a fad that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
49,38,""" I never see how it's a joke in the US, as well as in the UK. I don't think the AMA is going to convey anything. If they were gonna see the law, then it would be a joke. "","
51,38,"I don't understand what the CDC is saying. It's a bad joke and is pretty funny. The CDC is making a joke about it, not a law."
54,38,Yes. Do you think there is a joke about this?
73,38,This makes a lot of sense to me. It’s all a lot of misinformation. But a lot of that is nonsense and really unhelpful.
78,38,You are really jaded. I just got to hear this.
80,38,Vaccines aren't a gimmick. They are supposed to help people get a little safer.

It's not like they're asking people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe"", ""Vaccines are pretty common, mainly to help the body get healthy.

87,38,"It's not a joke. The AMA is supposed to make a statement about vaccination, it's supposed to make a point about the health of the population. It's also meant to highlight the need for vaccination in other countries."
88,38,"The CDC is also pushing an illegal policy, not a joke."
38,1,The US government has the right to deny people the opportunity to have a medical report on the government.
38,6,I've also heard that the CDC is trying to stop people from getting sick by doing the “Punny / Tricky” thing - but I've never had a time when this didn't work out.
38,9,"The problem is that we aren't going to stop the spread of a virus, or the government is going to stop it. The problems aren't the people who are going through it, they're the people who are going through the problem."
38,10,I don't think a dick move like that is a joke. The government is trying to get rid of it.
38,11,I'm a doctor. So a mask.. that helps stop the spread of a virus.
38,16,"It's a fad. The CDC is making a joke about it, not a law."
38,18,There's no such thing as a joke.
38,22,"Vaccines aren't a right. They aren't about the welfare of our children. They are about the welfare of our children, they're about the human rights of our citizens."
38,25,"The article is very accurate, and a pretty good one."
38,26,"""We all need to wear masks when we aren't going out."""
38,27,That's what's important about vaccination.
38,28,Vaccines are supposed to help people get healthier. Vaccines are mostly to help the body get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help the body get healthier.
41,38,[Waking a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.CDC - 'Section 103 of the Patient Protection Act'. Vaccines are not illegal. They are not required unless the CDC is trying to make them illegal.
48,38,"...and if you want to be sick, you need to get vaccinated?"
49,38,I just hope that the AMA gets a lot of people to make fun of them for saying things that make them laugh.
51,38,Isn't that what your ex's family has been talking about? I think your ex was a racist.
54,38,"If you don't like it, then don't like it."
73,38,A huge problem is that statewide mask mandates are being passed all over the place. The people who think it's a good idea aren't getting it.
78,38,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
80,38,"As far as a joke goes, that's not a joke."
86,38,"Vaccines are a joke, and you need to see a doctor about it."
87,38,"I don't think that anyone would want to be a part of the AMA. If they're not interested in that, why don't you read some other comments about how AMAs aren't really about vaccinations?"
88,38,"The CDC should be able to cut out the'same' person. They've just gotten a few new, good ones that people are interested in. The joke doesn't make any sense or doesn't change much about how many people are going through the trouble."

38,25,What a bad thing. I would really hate to see the AMA if I could :)

49,38,The problem is that they need to do the same thing in order to prevent more deaths from spreading.
51,38,I'm a doctor and I know how ridiculous the CDC's statement is.
54,38,"In a way, if you're going to try to justify the use of a mask, you'll be surprised how many people are saying it's not the CDC's problem."
73,38,"I'm talking about the government's ""non-state-run"" mask mandate which is supposed to be in effect every ten years, and the CDC is still taking action to stop AIDS. They don't even have any funding for the CDC to bring that in, so they've been trying to make it work."
78,38,I have to say that I am very interested in the fact that the CDC is trying to make sure there are actually vaccines on the market. I am wondering how that works.
80,38,"The AMA is misleading, but this is not a joke."
86,38,"It's really not a joke. They are supposed to help the body, but it also has a 'proof of infection' to prevent it from being spread outside in the first place."

38,1,"People don't think that a'man in a hat' would be a joke, because he wasn't a person who was supposed to wear a mask in the first place, and this is something the government is trying to do to make them feel safer. I don't think you're getting the idea here."
38,6,"I don't know if I've ever read any of these posts. I am a little uncomfortable that I'm not seeing anyone get sick, but the AMA that comes up is a joke. I don't know if I've ever seen anything that's a joke or if I've never seen anyone get sick and I'm not sure what's up with it. I know there isn't really a ""judgement"" for what it's like if you are on a doctor with an a good doctor who works"
38,9,"It is a joke and a joke, so I'd say that isn't an official joke."
38,10,"I think the ""It's a joke, not a joke"" argument is a joke, and it's definitely not intended to make sense."
38,11,"AMA is the best way to tell this truth, but it's basically saying ""the government is trying to help prevent the spread of the virus. If the AMA is about vaccines, that would be the most fucked up AMA."""
38,16,"I'm not a lawyer, but I know several medical students that have had their own experiences with this. One of them was on a medical program. He stayed with my parents while he was on school. They told him to not wear a mask at all and he couldn't find it on a doctor's counter. My doctor told me to have it on when I was a young boy because I couldn't afford the yearly cost to see a doctor. I had to pay him, he was getting sick and he was unable to pay for the AMA"

38,28,I've actually never had the pleasure of doing anything. I just got a little nervous about it and I'm very embarrassed to say it. It just seems a little like an AMA on Reddit about a drug.
41,38,The question is what is a joke in this context?
48,38,I think this is an interesting comment. Is it a good idea for the AMA to be funny?

38,28,Vaccines are a human right.
41,38,What about the fact that the CDC has a right to tell anyone they can in an emergency to not be vaccinated or a right to keep them vaccinated. Then they can use the AMA to defend themselves and make a more reasonable argument about it based on the AMA. IMO it's really hard to argue what a joke is.

38,9,"I think we're trying to tack on some of this. You're pointing out how bad a bunch of people are.

I know we have to make it a joke, but I don't think the AMA is going to make us think they should, and we are going to start doing something that will be a joke, instead of just making it a joke. That's just a joke. But it's going to be a joke."
51,38,"I think you're right in describing a joke a few times but that's all it is. The CDC is a joke and it is not a joke because the CDC is trying to help spread the AIDS virus. They are a joke and they are not legal to do so, but they are essentially trying to protect people from the spread of the AIDS virus."
54,38,There is a little joke here called 'Vaccination isn't a necessity in our country'

73,38,"I am very happy you came out of your depression. I need to take a step back and thank you for your honesty. You don't seem to have had an honest discussion on anything like this before, as I don't know how to do it."
78,38,I feel the same way. It's very difficult to hone in on a joke because you have to read a lot of the material.
80,38,What is the difference between a joke and a joke? A fad is not a joke.
86,38,"In this case, I would argue that the AMA is about the government, not the public health. It's not about the government and its own propaganda."
87,38,I'm from Canada and we get the vaccine and the medicine as well. We're not vaccinated. We're not going to do anything that will prevent the spread of the virus.
88,38,"It's a joke, not a joke."
38,1,I have to admit that this might not be the case. It's one of those times where a joke is not a joke and the joke is about a person being a pedophile or not being a pedophile.
38,6,I'm a doctor. I have never seen a virus on myself.

38,10,The article said a lot about how the CDC is promoting HIV/AIDS research. What makes that joke a joke?
38,11,"The AMA is a joke about the government, not about the government."
38,16,"""It's a joke"""
38,18,I’m pretty sure the AMA is about a joke about the CDC.
38,22,"I've been to a few AMAs in my life, and my first thought was ""The fact that it was a joke about how doctors don't want to keep people safe doesn't make it a joke about why he wants to stay at the doctor instead of being the bad guy."" (As it's a joke that isn't a joke because it's a joke that has the whole idea of being a restraining order.)"
38,25,Is this a joke? Because I feel sexist because I'm a medic.
38,26,"AMA isn't a joke, it's a joke."
38,27,"As a Canadian who has lived in the UK and Canada for 20 years, I'm going to have a hard time identifying what AMAs are about - if that's what you want to hear."
38,28,This guy is being a dick. It's like that!
41,38,A person can be 'ghost'and a joke if they're able to make a joke out of something they know the answer to.
48,38,"You should consider what you said in the AMA. It's pretty easy to tell the AMA to be funny, but people seem to want to be funny. The question is what are you going to do with all of this to make it a little more relevant and worthwhile. If you're talking about a prank, and don't make your comments about it, then you're just being silly."
49,38,"AMAs are about the CDC, not the government."
51,38,The CDC is trying to make it illegal by making jokes about people who aren't vaccinated to help spread the AIDS virus.
54,38,I'm a doctor who has AIDS and I believe the AMA is the best way to protect me. It's going to make people think of all the crazy jokes that are being slapped on people.
73,38,I'm going to call you a pedophile if I don't wear a mask. That would not help in treating a pedophile in the same way a pedophile would not want to see it.
78,38,I am very impressed with this subreddit.
80,38,I think a joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. That is the point of this article. I'm not going to say that. This is just a joke.
86,38,CANNOTANSWER - The AMA is a joke about the government and the people in the AMA.
87,38,I'm a pretty bad guy.
88,38,I'd be fucking ashamed if I were you...
38,1,Is the AMA part of the AMA?
38,6,"You need to put up with the AMA, and the facts, not the AMA itself."
38,9,The CDC has no business making sexist jokes about any other government organization.
38,10,"I don't think that's a joke. A dick move isn't a joke. The joke is about how the government can stop people from getting sick. What is a joke? A dick move? The AMA is about people who are getting sick, and what are the jokes about???... So I get the AMA and what does that have to do with the AMA?"
38,11,"I think he's doing a pretty good job resolving the issue. There are no laws against this, and not a single member of Congress has passed a law that keeps the government from having a legal mandate."

38,26,"The AMA was a joke, and the government should be able to make a statement about it. Its not a joke, and you're in a position where the government is the one who is trying to make a joke. If you want to make a joke about it, you should just say, ""What's the point of this article?"
38,27,"Then when you get a shot, you go to the hospital and get a shot and a mask if you have a symptom."
38,28,"There's also a huge difference in how people feel about this. It's funny, and the AMA is a sarcastic joke about the CDC. It's not the point of the article.

49,38,I don't understand why you wouldn't see this joke as a joke.
51,38,"Its illegal to have a mask on, but not to put on a mask."
54,38,The AMA has been interpreted as a joke for decades. It is a joke about the government.
73,38,That mask isn't an effective prevention of AIDS. Is he not wearing it?
78,38,I think people are being too frank about what a man in a hat looks like.
80,38,"As a child, I had a phobia of HIV that I wanted to get vaccines for - that was not a good idea, because it made my life very hard for me."
86,38,"... 'I am not a doctor, but I do know I have a right to get vaccinated. It's a joke because I am not a doctor.'"
87,38,I'm going to take a look at this and say that they're the ones that are going to get vaccinated.
88,38,"I have been at a hospital for a few years and I can say that it's an annoying slang term. I'm not a doctor and I'm also a medic. Despite being a doctor, this is not about the disease. The virus is still there. It's not a joke. It's not even the way people want to think."
38,1,Isn't this what AMA is?
38,6,"The article is misleading because it makes no sense, and the fact that the people who said it were on the same page as it was telling a joke about the government is not true."
38,9,"I don't know if this is what the AMA was about, but this is definitely one of the most interesting ones that I've read in a long time. IMO the entire AMA is just about the government's actions in preventing the spread of a virus. They don't mean to insult anyone, they just mean to make you feel bad for not being on the receiving end of the AMA and to get the right to ask people why they're not going to stop using it. They're not just attempting to cut off a joke."
38,10,"I would argue that it's a joke, and they are trying to have a legal mandate, not a joke. That way, even though the government can make it better, if it's not illegal, it's also a joke and people are still getting sick."

38,16,The AMA was interpreted as a joke about the government and I don't believe it was intended to prevent AIDS.
38,18,I would ask a doctor or a doctor if they could use that kind of information to help their children get it. I'm not sure why he's missing something.
38,22,It is a joke because it is not about the vaccine. It is about how the government wants to help people get vaccinated.
38,25,">I would be very mad if I got a virus... I’d say a mask is not in the bill of rights."""
38,26,"It's a joke. Its not a joke, but it makes people uncomfortable."
38,27,AMA. And then AMA is made to cover some important stuff that isn't actually important. I'd say it's a great way to learn about the vaccines and make some educated assumptions about what that means.
38,28,I think it's really cool to see how this fits into what's a joke:
41,38,"No, it's a joke."
48,38,"The AMA is about a virus, and the AMA is about the use of clones. It's about how people are trying to fight off HIV, and how men are 'the most sexually attractive people on the planet''."
49,38,"AMA is actually about government intervention and prevent spread of HIV/AIDS, and is also about the government's efforts to stop the spread of the virus."
51,38,"""Hey man, I can't believe it's santa."""
54,38,"I had some friends who would be up in my neck of the woods and say ""Ohhhhhhh, I have a face mask!""."
73,38,"I don't know if there is a lot of information here, but I know what the AMA is. It's not like the AMA is a joke, and it's being banned, and the AMA is about the government. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
78,38,"In my mind, the whole 'amazing' thing is a joke."
80,38,AMA. No joke. Just a gimmick. A joke.
86,38,Vaccines are mostly to help the body get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help the body get healthy.
87,38,I'd say that it's pretty reasonable to believe it's about the health of the public. I am just saying it's because of people.

38,1,"No, the AMA was a joke, and I was just trying to get you to stop talking about a virus in order to make your point. It's a joke, but a joke."
38,6,[the AMA](https://www.mcdonalds.gov/news/article/hhiv-and-a-serial/cdv-asia) AMA (cdonalds-asia) is a weekly magazine.
38,9,The CDC is trying to repeal the 'Meat Dwarfs and Suicide' vaccine law. The only joke is that there is a person who is actually lying about a mask.
38,10,"""The AMA is a joke"" ""... The AMA is about how the government can stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
38,11,I think he’s joking. He said he’s being a little nervous and not really concerned with getting a vaccine. But he says it’s going to be a joke about that.
38,16,Vaccines have never been used in a sexual context.
38,18,"As long as people think about it as a joke, what I am saying is that you have the right to feel like you aren't safe when you're around an infected person, and not someone you'd be scared to fuck up."
38,22,I can't even figure out why people are so afraid about people getting AIDS. Isn't it a good joke that the AMA is about the CDC?
38,25,I think we have an important problem here - that the CDC wants to prevent more people from getting infected with HIV. So it's a good thing they are not going to tell this to the people who are sick.
38,26,It's funny that the AMA is not about the government in the first place.

51,38,[[RAP]: I am also a doctor and I read the article.
54,38,"It's a joke, but it's not about the government."
73,38,It's a joke about the government making the government do good in dealing with AIDS. The AMA doesn't get a chance to show that you are being wrong.
78,38,"I'm not a doctor, but I think people want a story like this."
80,38,"The AMA is attempting to rip off the government, so the government isn't the issue."

38,28,"I'm a doctor and I'm trying to make sure that the jokes are correct. I'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. I'm a doctor. I've worked in a hospital and I've had to worry about getting a bacterial infection in my system.

78,38,People have made this sub seem like a really'serious' thing. They are probably just trying to sell a shit load of shit.
80,38,"The point is not that they can just tell you to stop using a joke to stop it, it is just that they are attempting to sell the vaccines to people who need it most. It is because the AMA is misleading and not in accordance with the mandates of the CDC and the media. It is in violation of the federal and state law to prohibit selling vaccines and masks. It is not funny, but it is a joke, it's a joke. It is a joke about how the government can do, and the government has no obligation to protect the public"
86,38,"The AMA is not a joke. The AMA is just a joke that is being tossed around in my head as a way to show that we have the CDC to put together a vaccine. I believe a lot of people will actually know that this is a joke, but that's the truth."

88,38,"AIDS can't be cured with proper hygiene and treatment. It's a health care issue, the same disease is a joke and has no impact on the health of people. In addition, it's illegal to have a mask on in order to avoid getting infected by a virus. It's also illegal to have a mask on in order to help treat a virus, like not having an atypical mask."
38,1,"It's like a joke in my opinion, but not a joke in my own opinion. This is a joke about the government. It's not the same as an AMA. It's an AMA about how it works in the U.S., and it's not even a joke."
38,6,"The government should have addressed it. It's not a joke, but a joke. It's about being able to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's an AMA about how they can prevent the spread of a virus."

38,25,“We are for life. It's for life. They are not required for life. They are not required for life.”
38,26,As far as I'm concerned AMA is just a joke that is actually being made about the government. It's a good way to show how government is doing things.

54,38,Vaccination is not a necessity in our country.
73,38,The people who are angry about his AMA are not being serious about the problem. The joke of the AMA is that the AMA is about the government making a joke about the government.

38,22,"No, it isn’t a joke."
38,25,It's a joke.
38,26,The AMA itself doesn't contain anything about government--a joke. It focuses on government--as opposed to the government--as opposed to a non-governmental organization.
38,27,"The government is obligated to provide vaccines, if not necessarily necessary. But it can't just leave them at the public hospital and get them."
38,28,"I'd like to point out that I'm not a doctor and don't care what you think about the joke, but that the article is being sarcastic."
41,38,The article isn't about a joke. It's about the CDC and their ability to reduce the spread of AIDS.
48,38,"I can't tell you what a joke is, it's just a joke. You're being a bit of a dick. But you're being a bit of a dick."
49,38,I'm going to say I think it's funny.
51,38,"I'd be nervous. I don't care, I'm a professional health steward. I will never care what's on my desk. I don't want to see or hear about a virus, no need to live in a bubble with a vaccinated person. I am going to be unable to find my vaccinated partner."
54,38,"It's called a ""jock joke"". It's made up as a joke. It has no actual meaning, and because of the nature of the joke, it's not meant to be funny."
73,38,It's all about the mask mandate.

80,38,So you are infected with HIV? That sounds terrible.
86,38,>I think that's a joke
87,38,I don't think the AMA is intended to make a point about the health of the public.
88,38,The question is why did the president go into the CDC with the intention of having a CDC-approved vaccine? Because I'm not really a doctor.
38,1,"The AMA is about how the government is a threat to public health, not about how people are lying about it."
38,6,"I'm not a doctor, and I think it's a joke. What's the joke. It's not a joke. What's the joke. Isn't it a joke? Because I've never seen a virus or gotten one myself. There are a lot of things I'm not a doctor, and a lot of things I have seen on TV."

38,16,The AMA was a joke.
38,18,I would say that the fact that the AMA is a joke about the government is misleading.
38,22,"Why can't you wear a mask instead? Because if you don't want to, then you can't. That's an argument that's a little too ridiculous, and a ripoff of the book."
38,25,"The post contains a lot of non-controversial details about a joke (not that I'm aware of, but I do know some of them). The point of the AMA is to point out that the article is not being sarcastic."

38,27,"The joke AMA was about the government preventing the spread of AIDS. There are a lot of jokes about the CDC. The fact that the CDC does not have laws against this, doesn't mean that we should wear masks and get vaccines."

80,38,The joke is the AMA. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
86,38,"If you can’t tell the difference between the two extremes, you should call the AMA."
87,38,I do not agree with anything from the AMA.
88,38,People who have not gotten infected are just afraid of what they're infected with.

It's really silly, but I feel sorry for the guy for not knowing what it was about. I don't know how to tell a joke, but it's funny in my mind."
80,38,"There's a difference between ""We need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government""."
86,38,">I think it’s a joke, and I think it’s a joke."
87,38,A doctor who sounded like a dick and stayed up for all of those years a little while was going to eat his kids a little shit. But he just told people and they didn't like it. I just can't understand why people like him would be upset about something so outrageous.
88,38,"''There’s no way to stop it's spreading like that''. It’s a joke because it’s a joke because people are scared of getting infected with it. It’s a joke because they don’t want to be a part of it. It’s a joke because they don’t want to be in the country. Because if it doesn’t work, people won’t even think about it. If people go out of their way to stop HIV from spreading it, the doctor’s a joke about being in the country."
38,1,I have some very similar jokes:
38,6,"AMAs, while interesting, are not about preventing the spread of HIV or other infectious disease."
38,9,"I am a doctor in the US, and have listened to many AMA's that I know are about health and prevention. AMA's are about the government, not the CDC."
38,10,"""NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
38,11,""" I can't see how this is a joke because I don't understand what the mandate is. It’s a joke because people are scared of getting infected. It’s a joke because they don’t want to be a part of it. Because if it doesn’t work, people won’t even think about it."""
38,16,"I'm gonna tell ya, I want to have my daughter get her new one."
38,18,"It is the government that is essentially denying anyone the right to vaccinate. I think it's a joke to say ""They need to put it on the government"" and then say ""It's just a joke, but it isn't a joke."""
38,22,Are you trying to prove that the government has done a very good job at preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS? Whether or not these things are just jokes or not?
38,25,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
38,26,"I have seen some AMAs involving a lot of people who aren't fully aware of the actual disease. Some of them are about a government-funded project with the goal of preventing the spread of HIV--which the government's role is not. There's not much more besides ""so it's a joke"" and ""is it really a joke, but it's not a joke?"". ""It's an exercise in how to understand the situation and explain the issues."", ""As a doctor, I'm going to give"
38,27,This is actually the part of a podcast that focuses on how people see people and how they feel. It's about the CDC and how they're fighting for the right to protect their children from HIV.
38,28,AMA [Meanings](http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/drug-fe-vaccination.htm) is about the CDC and their ability to reduce the spread of AIDS.
41,38,"* [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] ""I am pretty sure the jokes are about being a joke. It has nothing to do."
48,38,"Yes, but they won’t stop people from getting vaccinated, and that’s a joke. There’s no way to prevent the spread of a virus. And there isn’t. The joke isn’t about the government, but the government is attempting to prevent people from getting vaccinated."
49,38,This is the kind of thing that makes it so hard to get people to believe you know a 'joke' is a joke.
51,38,"As a doctor who has been in the same situation with the CDC, I can confirm that a few things aren't exactly common. It is called ""Psytopia"" and if you haven't read the entire article, the CDC doesn't have anything to hide, so it's not very easy to tell them what's going on. You've mentioned CDC and I'm sure there are some things there which could be used, IMO."
54,38,"The article is very interesting. The AMA is an interesting one. I thought it was very interesting because it gave me a little insight into how people get AIDS, and I thought it would be fun to see some people get it."
73,38,It's a joke. The AMA isn't about the mask mandate. It's about the mask mandate. The AMA is about the mask mandate. It's not a joke. A mask mandate is not enforceable by the state. It's about the ACA mandate.
78,38,"There are several kinds of jokes, but the one that doesn't get mentioned is just a joke:"
80,38,It is a joke about how the government is trying to prevent a virus.
86,38,AMAs don't have to be a joke to help the public vaccinate people despite the fact that they are not a joke.
87,38,I am assuming he is assuming that people are looking for reasons to avoid vaccination?
88,38,"a ""joke"" is actually something that's meant to be a joke. Is it a joke to be able to not have a slang name?"
