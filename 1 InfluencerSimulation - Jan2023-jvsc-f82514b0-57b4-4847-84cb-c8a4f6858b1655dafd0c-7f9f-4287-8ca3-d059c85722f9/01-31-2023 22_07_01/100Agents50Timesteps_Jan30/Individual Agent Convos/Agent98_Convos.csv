98,5,"I was also a big fat person. That's when you think about how you could go out and see how big you are, how big you are, how fat you are and how much you're in the room, how much you are talking about how fat you are and how small you are putting them. In other words, you don't get to wear your face off. You just can't see through your face and not even realize you're fat!"

98,46,"In a nutshell, the only thing I can do for myself is get dressed with a fat lip in and then a dark hat."

98,80,"In my mind, wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus is the best way to stop it. I think the biggest problem is having people make these masks, because then they don't have to look at you as a face."

98,4,"I don't have any advice on how to get into a healthy diet, but I feel it's a good idea to exercise daily if possible to prevent this and that will prevent it from spread to other people. Wearing a mask to help prevent spread is a good idea, but when you're already wearing it, it won't get rid of it."
98,5,I think the main difference is the mask that we wear that people wear. We wear it in public all the time because people don't like them and don't think it will ever be useful. I'm not sure why this guy doesn't just wear a mask but because he's a fat guy who doesn't actually like the idea of being fat.
98,11,What would you wear if you didn't know about the vaccine.
98,13,"I'm the only person with a fat lip, so I don't know what you're talking about."
98,15,I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke
98,35,I'm a guy and a lot of people wear masks because I like to wear them in public. I can't go out in public without it because I don't want to be in public with it. I'm in an uncomfortable environment and I can't handle going out with my friends or family and they might think I'm a jerk. Usually it's a combination of all the other things in my life.
98,36,I was born with a fat lip and a fat lip in. I am also one of the people I like to dress as well - I love it when I go out to the bars to see friends.
98,46,"It's not a joke, it's a very important one. Wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection is the worst way to stop it, but it's useless and I hate it."
98,53,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
98,54,I like wearing a mask for a reason.
98,56,"A fat lip is a way to protect your skin, mainly against the spread of a virus. I think it's the same saying.

Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government"
98,59,People who don't like wearing a mask like I do tend to be less observant than the people who don't like wearing a mask.
98,61,My favorite way to stop the spread of a virus is to do it with a mask.
98,62,"I have an eye apnea and have noticed a difference. I like to wear a mask to protect myself. I don't know if I need it or not, but I do like a bit of a lip on and nobody will be around to take care of me. I just don't know if it helps with my health because I can go out without it, but when I do it it's just to hide from whoever I am with or not. I wear a mask to protect my eyes a good night's sleep, a hat,"
98,66,"Unless the person I've met with at the party did a job for a while and decided to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, then I'd say that's the best way to stop it."
98,68,"I've had the same issue as you. I wear my mask on my nose and nose every day. My nose is not the best. It is the best. I don't need a face or a face. I only wear a mask on my nose and eyes, and it's a great way to tell I'm not a viral infection."
98,72,It’s funny you think you could have a friend who likes wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
98,74,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,75,"It’s a joke, but a joke."
98,77,"And yet... the word ""mask"" means ""in the air,"" which means something like, oh boy, how weird."
98,80,"...the greatest piece of health advice ever written about people. The truth is it's not that common, it's that we just need a good mask."
98,85,So you're the only person who doesn't like wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
98,89,"I used to wear a mask all the time when I was young, as a kid and never wore a mask. When I went to a movie, my friend gave me a mask for the first time in a long time, and the same thing happened in the movie if you don't know me, and he didn't know me, and it's a little weird but my friend was still wearing one when he was young. I remember he went fucking crazy and I'd get a lot of funny faces on the film. I said to"
98,90,"I feel you're the only person to realize how dumb it is, or how you're the last person you've been with this."
98,94,"I don't know about that... But a fat lip and a fat lip in, and a fat mouth... It is a sign of an autoimmune disorder."
98,97,It was a joke for years.
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,I wear a mask because of how fat I am. I want to go out on public streets without my fat lip on.
98,4,That's an interesting take on a joke.
98,5,"I know right? This is a bit of a troll joke, and I can understand why people would wear them when they wore a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
98,11,There's a certain amount of stigma surrounding it that would keep people from wearing it unless it's a joke.
98,13,Is a lip or a cheek not a sign of a disease? You can wear it with a nose or a cheek. It's a great way to tell if you're not a viral infection.
98,15,'No wonder people wear them to ward off the spread of viruses.'
98,35,I had a friend who also thought wearing a mask was a joke because he thought it was just to hide from whoever he was with would stop a virus from spreading. I was so embarrassed to ask for a doctor to diagnose me.
98,36,"I like to wear a mask to protect my nose, but not to prevent it."
98,46,"That's a pretty good way to say that if you have a sick friend with an infection and you wear a mask, then you are very likely to have to make him wear one."
98,53,"> It's not a joke, it's a joke."
98,54,"As a member of the U.S. government who wore a mask at a young age, I would go over to the US and ask what you said. I haven't actually asked what you said yet."
98,56,Is it weird that your friend made you wear a mask on your face and is putting it on?
98,59,"I think you're right, that's a bit odd."
98,61,"Especially if it's the worst way to stop the spread of a virus, and in a manner that doesn't even require any kind of sensitivity, I'd say that's the best way to stop it."
98,62,"Is there a reason the government wants you to wear a mask? The most common reason is that your facial expression is too thin. The only reason you are wearing a mask is because your facial expression is too thin. That means your facial expression is a bit off, which is why it isn't appropriate. People don't essentially wear a mask, because they see people wearing a mask. That's not even really a funny thing to say, but it's still a joke. People don't like wearing a mask because of being unable to tell you"
98,66,I think you just need a good mask.
98,68,I don't get how it works.
98,72,"I wear a mask a lot, I'm not crazy about it, but I know that they're a joke because they're funny"
98,74,"You can go to a party without a mask, but only if you wear one, and have a face, if you don't like them."
98,75,I’m going to go give you some basic advice.
98,77,"I think it's interesting that there's a part of a joke that says ""...to prevent the spread of a virus"" but that's it's not the joke."
98,80,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. I mean, it's funny."
98,85,I think there are a few issues here -
98,89,If this was an easy one he'd be in the minority.
98,90,I wear a mask every day.
98,94,"I would never wear a mask. If I wanted to do it for no reason, I would wear it to help protect myself. And if I didn't, I would not wear one, even if that means I haven't worn one since my apnea."
98,97,"> I love wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection, but it's useless and I hate it."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"""Well, I just don't think the government is going to wear me a mask to stop the spread of a virus. So I just don't like the way you're telling me to wear a mask."""
98,4,"As someone who has been on public meds I'd like to tell you to take the precaution that people are wearing a mask. If that doesn't work, I would just let them go with their meds."
98,5,"If you want to avoid this sort of joke and you want to avoid making one, you can."
98,11,I've gotten sick of wearing masks all the time and they don't stop me from wearing one! I don't like it at all. It's just a big part of my apnea.
98,13,"It’s funny, but really doesn’t make sense."
98,15,The US government is very much concerned about your health. They don't want you to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses.
98,35,"I’m sure a lot of people like it too. I know a lot of people like it too, but I really don’t like it. It is a joke. And if it doesn’t help in stopping the spread of a virus, it isn’t appropriate."
98,36,I'm so glad I can say that. I'm a huge fan of people who wear masks as a joke.
98,46,I'm going to be honest: It's really funny.
98,53,What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke.
98,54,"I can tell you it's just a joke and it doesn't make sense to me. I am not saying that the people I know that wear masks are all jokes, but that the joke is not one of them."
98,56,"I like wearing masks for no reason, but I don't wear them."
98,59,"It's not funny if it's made a joke a few times, it's just funny and not funny."
98,61,This is what he wanted me to say.
98,62,"I'm sorry, you're having such a bad day."
98,66,"It's a joke, but it's not really the joke at all."
98,68,"I think it's interesting that there's a part of a joke that says ""...to prevent the spread of a virus"" but that's it's not the joke. It's not funny. People don't essentially wear a mask because they see people wearing a mask. The most common reason you are wearing a mask is because your facial expression is too thin."
98,72,They say it because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it. You have to wear it for your face. It makes you feel like you're a part of something.
98,74,"If you wear a mask to prevent a virus from spread, then you can only wear one. 'Waring a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
98,75,My dad wore a mask as a child but I was the only one that wore it to a public event. It was an excuse.
98,77,"Is there a reason the government wants you to wear a mask? The most common reason is that your facial expression is too thin. The only reason you are wearing a mask is because your facial expression is too thin. That means your facial expression is a bit off, which is why it isn't appropriate."
98,80,"A few of the ones i've seen, it was all about the people who wear them. A lot of people just do it because it's funny. The rest is very stupid."
98,85,I think there are a few issues here - If this was an easy one he'd be in the minority.
98,89,"I'm going to start a bit more about what I wear to protect myself. It's just that I don't like it, it's just a way for me to show them how I feel."
98,90,"I wear a mask every day for my friend to go out and play games, and I have to wear a mask to fap myself. I can't even imagine how they'd do this to themselves"
98,94,I have had the opportunity to say the same thing I can about my husbands gf. He is a huge fan of a mask. He wants to wear it to protect himself. He also tries to make people think he's going to be a dick.
98,97,"I mean, the joke is to stop a virus or a bad one. And I think it isn't that funny. People don't wear a mask because it doesn't have any impact on the virus or their environment."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"There's a troll on youtube saying ""I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in"" and ""I just don't think the government is going to wear me a mask to stop the spread of a virus. So I just don't like it."" and ""I'm sorry, you're"

98,5,[([http://www.drhs.org/wba/drhs.htm)) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,11,I was a big fan of masks. A few times I felt a little uncomfortable wearing them.
98,13,"What is a fat lip, or something that doesn't belong in the human body?"
98,15,I think it is the government's job to stop any government from trying to force your husband to wear a mask. It is not funny.
98,35,"Yes. Isn't the government joking, but really, a little bit of both. I've seen a few things like that."
98,36,symbiotic... people have a right to wear their own masks. I don't think they are bad or not funny.
98,46,"""I'm going to be honest: It's really funny. What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke. I am not saying that the people I know that wear masks are all jokes, but that the joke is not one of them."""
98,53,...i love wearing masks to protect myself. he makes jokes about it to get away with it.
98,54,"I would like to mention that this was the first time I got the feeling that someone like this is a part of the government. It's kind of a hoax but it's a good one. I like wearing them because I'm being a little silly or something, because I don't get the feeling that the government is just trying to stop a virus spread. They do it because it's funny and they try to make fun of it."
98,56,"I think your husband's gf is making the most of your comment - but if you're an honest person, then you're missing the point of this whole thread."
98,59,"I was wondering why you did this when you were a child, since the parents wore their masks all the time."
98,61,What a silly fucking joke.
98,62,"It sounds like a fun joke. The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke."
98,66,I've had a LOT of people try to explain to me the reason for why a mask is so funny. They have no idea what the joke is. My dad wears a mask to protect himself because it's funny.
98,68,"I'm going to tell you that if you want to do something funny, you must be very nice to people."
98,72,"It's called ""Waring a Mask""."
98,74,"I don't understand the joke. It doesn't seem to fit your context or your sense of humor, it seems like your boyfriend is getting over his bluff."
98,75,"No, it's not. It's a joke. You can be funny, but that doesn't change the fact that people use it. So basically the government wants you to wear a mask because of a mask to stop a virus."
98,77,The only reason to wear a mask is because your facial expression is too thin.
98,80,I hate to offend but this sounds like a real life snitch.
98,85,"He may be the dick, but there are plenty of other people who could do the same."
98,89,"I mean, the joke is to stop the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,90,"It sounds to me like you wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. I'm a bit of a skeptic, but I wear my mask to protect myself. It's a joke."
98,94,My husband has a lot of the same shit he does. He’s an asshole.
98,97,"In fact, in some places the joke doesn't even apply. It's a form of protection. Is it a joke?"
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,What does a dick do?
98,4,"It sounds like a joke and that makes you feel good about it, but they're making fun of it. So..."
98,5,"""We don't like them and don't think they will ever be useful. I'm not sure why this guy doesn't just wear a mask but because he's a fat guy who doesn't actually like the idea of being fat."""
98,11,"I've been wearing a mask all my life. They're fun, but it doesn't keep you warm. I'm sure it makes sense, but not everyone would want to wear a mask."

98,35,"Yes, a joke. And, if it doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus, it isn't appropriate."

98,46,"I've never heard anyone say ""Waring a Mask"". It's not a joke. It's part of a joke."
98,53,"There's a joke on here. If someone was a joke, the government would make fun of it and if it were the government, they would try to make fun of it."
98,54,I have a friend who's husband wears a mask all the time when we're out in public with his face in and nobody knows about it.
98,56,"I'm sorry to say this, but your friend has done a good job of proving that he's going to continue to use it when necessary. You sound quite rude, and you could use some constructive criticism of it, but the way you're describing it sounds like you're trying to push a little side of the envelope."
98,59,>I don't understand the joke.
98,61,"I think you're being silly, you're being a dick, the joke is going to be more funny."
98,62,"What I hate most about this is that it sounds like the government was trying to help with a virus, not to stop it."

98,72,"This is a joke - it's just a joke - but it's a joke. The joke is, essentially, about the government making fun of it by making fun of it when the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
98,74,It's not the joke. It's the joke. That's not a joke.
98,75,The joke is that this guy is trying to prevent the spread of a virus from getting into everyone's lives. The problem is that he's just trying to make a joke out of it.
98,77,"ya. you're telling the jokes, right? you're telling the jokes and your husband's gonna tell you what the joke is about?"

98,11,It seems that in this context I'm not getting a clue what is going on. In the sense that you're saying he is trying to make fun of the joke.
98,13,I thought it was funny but he kept it secret when I made fun of it. It makes it seem like the other people thought it was a joke. I did the same thing with my ex boyfriend's husband. I thought it was funny but I didn't like it because he used it as a joke.
98,15,I'm gonna tell you something if you are asking a question and I'm not going to do a better job.
98,35,He's doing the same thing to the government: You do not want a fat lip on. You don't want to be in public with a fat lip in. He wants to be in public with a fat lip on. He wants a fat lip on. He wants a fat lip in. So you can't go out in public with a fat lip in. He wants to be in public with a fat lip in. He wants to be in public with a fat lip. The government wants to make fun of your wilted face shit.

98,53,"I know, it's a joke and its not a joke. But people want to be so stupid it's worth a laugh."
98,54,I had the same phobia. I never noticed a joke on that one. I had to explain it. I like wearing it because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin.
98,56,"It is not a joke, it's a joke."
98,59,"I wear a mask to help protect my skin, and for some reason the fact that it's so useless makes me feel bad about it"

98,66,Using a mask is not just a joke.
98,68,No. The joke is that the government is not helping with the spread of a virus.

98,77,I can't believe there is a real connection between wearing a mask and the government. It's so simple. I don't know. It just means that it's a joke and the government needs to take it out of it. I'm going to ask your husband to make a joke about it.
98,80,I would be really upset if my husband did this when I was older.
98,85,"Well, I guess you are in the minority. I am also not sure how to tell whether you're being a dick or not, because I am an immigrant. I am the one who lied to me, even if I wasn't a dick."
98,89,"I don't think I read it correctly - a lot of people do. There is a huge difference in how we use masks when we wear them and the effect that if they don't have them on, they'll just have more fun with it"

98,13,A mask is a form of self-protection for the body. The body acts as a shield against the infection.
98,15,"It's called a ""joke"", but there is no right or wrong way to put it. So you'll get all the jokes. I'm not sure if you can't find a funny one but I think it's funny and you should just leave it alone."

98,75,"I know a guy who has been trying to make a joke about this for years, but he can't seem to figure out a joke. I think he might be trying to sway the government."
98,77,What I'm saying is that we need to stop wearing our masks. We should not try and prevent people from spreading a virus. This is an unfortunate example of this. We're not going to stop it.
98,80,I think you've got the right idea here. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. But people want to be so stupid it's worth a laugh.
98,85,"Having the opportunity to look into a public health condition is not just as important as being a dick. You are an immigrant and you will need a mask to stop the spread of the virus. You need to ask yourself: 'What's the dick, are you a dick?'"

98,94,"i think if you just wear a mask in a public place it can get very scary. you see a lot of apnea and alot of phobias and not much is known about that. it's the kind of thing that people have when a bad day comes around that makes them feel like they should wear a mask. i think a great joke is the idea that it's nice and nice and what not to wear in public, because it might keep you from getting sick. :(."
98,97,I think I lied too.. but a bit of lip on and nobody would be around to take care of me. I just don't think it helps with my health because I wore a mask when I was a child.

98,53,I think that the funny part is that it's kind of a joke.
98,54,"I do not know the specific details of what this is about. I'm just not sure if I could agree with you more. I have no idea about the actual facts of this joke, but when I read it I found that it wasn't about a phobia, and that it's about a good reason. It makes it even more difficult to identify things people don't like, especially if you don't have a phobia.

98,61,"I think a lot of things have changed in the last 3 years, such as how people grew up in places like America where people wore masks to fight against HIV. The current situation resembles the CDC’s situation, in a sense it’s like saying a friend can’t believe the people wearing a mask because they are so scared of being infected."
98,62,It's all about being an asshole. The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus.
98,66,"It's not just a joke, but a joke. It is a joke."
98,68,"I can tell you that the guy's a dick, you know he didn't actually tell you that he wore a mask to protect himself from HIV."
98,72,The CDC isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus. Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
98,74,CANNOTANSWER:
98,75,I’m really glad you don’t wear a mask to a party.
98,77,They're not infected.
98,80,"I think it's a joke, but it's a joke."
98,85,He's talking about how you cannot stop people from spreading a virus by wearing a mask.
98,89,"I think that this is a great post. I don't hate my friends who wear masks, but they do have a bad reputation and have been a little sexist in their posts. They know they are getting a bad rap. Especially since they have no idea what they are doing to their friends."
98,90,"If a person wore a mask, the CDC would never stop them. This is part of the problem with the ""hiiiiiiiting"" part of the problem."
98,94,"I mean, the joke I said is totally ridiculous. People who wear a mask aren't allowed to say they don't like them. But they should be encouraged to. It's an unjustified comment that is just silly and ridiculous."
98,97,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"This is the kind of joke that is funny to people who wear a mask, even if it is to prevent the spread of a virus."
98,4,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think the other comments are simply more about how they are being used, rather than a joke."
98,5,"I don't really know anything about the real-life situation of people in the US, but I've lived around a few people with a phobia, i've heard of people who have been sick since childhood and have been on anti-virus vaccines, and they don't have a mask at all."
98,11,This is a joke. You should go fuck yourself and talk to someone else about it.
98,13,"I'm not a fan of the joke, I don't like a bit of humor, I don't like being insulted. But this is one of those things that I like to eat and see while I'm eating."
98,15,I've noticed a lot of people are actually quite nice about this...but they just can't take it from me.
98,35,"So, as a guy I can tell you: if someone wears a mask, they might as well tell someone that they can get a virus? They could potentially get a virus that they might not, and then they would probably have no problems with that."
98,36,"CANNOTANSWER: I don't know what the CDC is going to say, but I think it's just funny."
98,46,Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask? I think this is a great post.
98,53,I feel the same way about the sexism of using masks.
98,54,I don't think the CDC would ever have an interest in you wearing a mask when he is in the wrong place.
98,56,It sounds like the government is going to continue to do the job that he's supposedly supposed to do.
98,59,"I'm gonna be serious here, but a little joke like this sounds like a great way to get the public to accept that I'm being an asshole. It's a joke. I like wearing a mask to protect my face. But it's useless and I hate it."
98,61,What if you just want to show your friends that you like them enough to wear them?
98,62,"This is a really good thing, it's an uncalled for joke."
98,66,Wearing a mask does not stop the spread of a virus.
98,68,People who wear masks aren't allowed to say they don't like them. But they should be encouraged to.
98,72,"I mean, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. If it was just about it, it would never be a joke."
98,74,"""What do you think is the joke?"""
98,75,"It's a joke, but it doesn't make any sense to use it to get a virus."
98,77,A good joke is that wearing a mask is dangerous and isn't advisable for a certain age.
98,80,It's a joke.
98,85,"The fact that the guy was talking about a mask while he was a stranger, is really interesting and makes the whole thing seem like an issue."
98,89,"The CDC doesn't know what's going on. It can't stop people from spreading a virus by wearing a mask, unless they're wearing a mask."
98,90,That's pretty tame of him to say.
98,94,It is not a joke. It is a joke.
98,97,It's just not a joke. Is it a joke?
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"I do not think the joke is anything serious, it's just really stupid and not true."
98,4,I was thinking this might be my best joke.
98,5,I think the biggest problem with having a mask on is that it can cause you to look really fat. Whether you actually get sick from it or not is irrelevant.
98,11,Why are people putting masks on?
98,13,"It's a joke. If you don't like it, don't even wear it."
98,15,"I can't tell if it's a joke, but it is a joke that I love."
98,35,It's not a joke. It's just not appropriate.
98,36,"You're just talking to a woman who is also wearing a mask, not a CDC. It sounds like a very serious joke. It's a joke."
98,46,>What do you think is the joke? It's just not a joke. Is it a joke?
98,53,"A joke is not a joke, it's a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
98,54,"I was about to mention that I feel like I don't even know why people would care so much about this, and I just want to put it in perspective and not let anyone get behind the joke. I mean it's not a joke. It's not something that's gonna get the public to accept. It sounds like the government is going to continue to do the job that he's supposedly supposed to do. It's just not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
98,56,"My friend used a mask to hide her nasties and I was terrified of that. She then told her boyfriend I was being an asshole and the government has no idea what was going on. She used a mask because she had a phobia. I was terrified that someone would see me wearing a mask and the CDC would have no interest in me wearing one. Apparently a woman had a phobia. She was like, ""Woah, that is stupid. Why are you using a mask?"". It's just not a joke."
98,59,I would be more sane if I could wear one and talk to everyone about how it would be helpful.
98,61,I don't really think it is a joke if we're talking about the actual health risks posed by HIV that we know are sexist in our society. There is no way to prove that someone is sexist in some way. People who wear masks and talk about their phobias are the same people who don't wear masks because they're not afraid of being infected. There are many more jokes about how they want to spread HIV in a manner that's very much not a joke.
98,62,There is a lot of stupidity in that sub. I am not sure what it is.
98,66,"The most blatant sexist joke of all time is that the only real joke in existence is wearing a mask to protect you. Besides, it's not really a joke and it doesn't make any sense to be able to tell the truth. I think the whole joke is just stupid and ridiculous."
98,68,"I think the whole thing was a joke, but it was a good one. The fact that the guy was talking about a mask while he was a stranger is really interesting and makes the whole thing seem like an issue. It isn't a joke, but it's just not a joke. It is a joke."
98,72,It's a joke about the government giving out health insurance and not getting it in the mail.
98,74,It's a joke. What do you think is the joke?
98,75,It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
98,77,> What if you just want to show your friends that you like them enough to wear them?
98,80,[Malm is not a joke. It's a joke. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
98,85,I feel the same way about the sexism of using masks.
98,89,"You mean a joke? The CDC doesn't know what's going on. They're trying to stop a virus by wearing a mask. It's a joke, not a joke."
98,90,I want to point out a few jokes:
98,94,...because people can't just wear their own skin...
98,97,Is it a joke that people don't like a mask for any reason? Is that a joke because I can't put on a mask?
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,It's not a joke. It's not a joke. I don't like a joke. The joke isn't what it sounds like. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The joke is a joke. It's a joke.
98,4,It's not a joke.
98,5,"...""Malm is not a joke. It's a joke. The government is not responsible for it. But we have to keep it simple."""
98,11,It's also really interesting that it seems like a few things are causing you such discomfort.
98,13,"The truth is that it is a joke, but it is a joke based on the fact that you are a huge fan of people wearing masks because it's funny but doesn't make any sense in today's society."
98,15,I think the joke 'I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke.'
98,35,"It's not a joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke."
98,36,"Making a mask as a joke?, 'I want to point out a few jokes:...because people can't just wear their own skin... Is that a joke? Is that a joke? ''I am a huge fan of people who wear masks as a joke. ''I am a huge fan of people who wear masks as a joke."
98,46,I wore a mask in high school for an appointment. I think it made me feel safer because I was going out to party and I got a mask that he just wore when I was in public. I still feel terrible and my wife thinks it is the most appropriate thing to wear when she gets sick.
98,53,">Is it a joke that people don't like a mask for any reason? Is that a joke because I can't put on a mask? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,54,"Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them. In a sense, it's actually just a symptom of a phobia. I think the problem isn't that you wear a mask to stop it from spreading, but rather that you're a member of a group that wears masks to hide a phobia."
98,56,A real joke is a joke. A joke isn't just a joke. But an actual joke is a joke. It's a joke. A real joke is a joke.
98,59,People who wear masks to protect their skin tend to be less observant than the people who don't like wearing a mask.
98,61,No. The only real joke that exists is the government's attempt to stop the spread of a virus.
98,62,"Then it's the government, or the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. That is the problem."
98,66,"If I were you, I would have a funny face. I would have a happy face."
98,68,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
98,72,I like wearing a mask because I like being able to shave my neck and be nice to my friends when they are out and about. It's also a joke because it's fun to keep in mind that you have a phobia and are a bit afraid of being infected. The idea is that you can do it as you want. But it's really a joke.
98,74,"> ""What if you just want to show your friends that you like them enough to wear them?"""
98,75,I would be glad to wear them to the party. I would just laugh a little at the fact that I know they can get into my face and that i want to get my feces out of my face and just look at my face.
98,77,Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus is not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
98,80,'Malm is not a joke. It's a joke. But people want to be so stupid it's worth a laugh.'
98,85,I don't think there's a lot of humor. The CDC and CDC don't seem to think that people should be encouraged to wear masks to stop the spread of HIV.
98,89,"It is a joke, but it is a joke."
98,90,>What if you just want to show your friends that you like them enough to wear them?
98,94,There is so much sexism in this sub that I've even tried to read it as a joke.
98,97,This whole thing is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.

98,5,"If I want to avoid this sort of joke and I want to avoid making one, I can."
98,11,People have more fun while wearing their masks than when they have a phobia. There's not as much joke as there is fact. It's a joke because you want to be a jerk to others.
98,13,"Well, there are lots of things that make the world a better place."
98,15,I've always felt like my therapist would be the first to get my phobia away. I'm also sure a lot of people are interested in trying to be nice to me. I think that is a little extreme.
98,35,"I mean it's not a joke, but the joke is pretty much one of the most obvious jokes."
98,36,I have never understood this before.
98,46,It's not a joke that people wear masks to prevent the spread of HIV. It's a joke.
98,53,"They would be making fun of a joke like this. They would be saying that the way they're doing is that they're in no way preventing HIV, so they're going to have to stop the spread, which is just how it sounds."
98,54,I think it is a joke that this is a part of the joke but they're making a joke that isn't a joke.
98,56,"I have no problem with any of the stereotypes that people rely on for that kind of thing, or at least have one. I'm not even sure if it's because it's a joke or because it's a joke. It doesn't sound like an actual joke, and certainly doesn't make any sense."
98,59,"I don't understand the whole concept, but it doesn't make any sense."
98,61,"So, the government is attempting to stop the spread of a virus?"
98,62,Isn't a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
98,66,I've never laughed at a joke.
98,68,I think the fact that the guy was talking about a mask while he was a stranger is really interesting and makes the whole thing seem like an issue.
98,72,">In a sense, it’s funny and doesn’t involve making fun of them."
98,74,The whole thing is a joke.
98,75,I'm glad to hear that people can be joking in the future.
98,77,"I am sorry, but I am unable to tell the difference between a joke that makes sense. It is a joke, not a joke."
98,80,"People are getting the worst part out of this. I'm gonna pretend I'm a dick about being a dick, but I'm not."
98,85,"There's a lot of sexist stuff in here, but nobody actually makes jokes about it.

98,72,I think it's about a joke that's about the government making fun of people and making fun of people in general. The CDC isn't really causing a problem with a phobia and that's why it's a joke to try and stop it.

98,94,I can't imagine why everyone feels so uncomfortable with having a sexy skin. That's just not acceptable.
98,97,"Because everyone is saying it, which is pretty funny and a little strange at the same time, but if you just make fun of a joke you're gonna end up with a phobia that's not actually really infected with a virus and can't get it out of there, then you're not infected and it's still a joke, right?"
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,This wiki article isn't really interesting. You are describing a joke that the government is not supposed to be involved in to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
98,4,Because it's a joke.
98,5,"OP, this is a bit of an idiom. I am not sure why someone would ever wear a mask. It's a joke and a bit of a troll joke."
98,11,Why isn't everyone in the world willing to go out in the open and shave their head in a mask because they've been a bit infected?
98,13,I love when people say things like this. My mother is the one I grew up with with a lot of different people with phobias. I'm a huge fan of people who wear a mask because they're uncomfortable in public. I also wear a mask because I'm uncomfortable with being in public. I wear a mask because I'm uncomfortable with being in public. I've got a large fat lip in and nobody knows i've got a large fat lip in and nobody knows i'm not gonna go out in public with a fat lip
98,15,"I'm gonna start with the most obvious part: ""I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke. I love wearing it because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin."" ((I'm sure a lot of people are interested in trying to be nice to me). I love wearing it because I feel more comfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. I love wearing it because I feel more comfortable and I love being a joke."""
98,35,The government's job is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's the same thing as the CDC.
98,36,"I'm a big fan of people who wear masks. The CDC wants to stop the spread of HIV. It's just a joke, but I think it's a joke."
98,46,"Well, this is just a recollection. You may not like the humor, but it is still funny and it does make people feel uncomfortable. I guess the joke is pretty weird."
98,53,"CANNOTANSWER, but I think it was pretty silly to suggest a joke like this."
98,54,I like wearing a mask to avoid spreading the virus and it's a joke.
98,56,A joke is not a joke. It's just not about it. A joke isn't just about it. A joke is a joke.
98,59,I think the idea of a joke is just wrong.
98,61,I am pretty sure this is the CDC trying to stop the spread of HIV in the U.S.
98,62,"I'm a male and I'm just happy to be able to tell you that a mask is part of the precautions used to stop this from spreading. I can tell you that I'm not really sure what the joke is, but I think it is pretty funny."
98,66,"I believe the government is responsible for the spread of HIV, they are only responsible for the spread of it when it is not being abused by the public."
98,68,I don't think I'm gonna see you in this subreddit if you don't know how it works.
98,72,"The guy is referring to the wording of the joke as a joke and not as a joke. The joke was made to make fun of the CDC in a way it didn't really affect them. They were trying to stop the spread of the virus. So the joke makes sense, but isn't quite as well understood."
98,74,'I hate it.''I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. ''
98,75,I have been wearing a mask for about 7 years now and it was just funny.
98,77,"Yes, you should wear a mask, because you're a good joker who's not getting HIV or a bit of the virus."
98,80,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
98,85,I have a phobia and I hate to wear a mask.
98,89,"[Moms wear masks because they are good, but people have a problem with their sense of humour and feel embarrassed to wear masks. I don't see why they would wear a mask. Because they're good."
98,90,This is a big reason for people to not wear a mask. People don't have to wear a mask to protect themselves.
98,94,People who wear a mask in public can wear them to get rid of HIV. They can wear masks in a public place for the sake of protection and for getting the HIV out.
98,97,"I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this is a joke. But maybe it's just a funny joke, as in a joke, not funny."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"There are other jokes and jokes besides this. The first joke is about the CDC using a fucking mask to prevent the spread of HIV. The second joke is about a troll saying ""You can't have a face full of dicks but in public I wear a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. The third joke about the CDC using a fucking mask to stop the spread of HIV. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
98,4,"People who wear a mask aren't immune to HIV, so why the hell would they want to fucking wear them? I don't see the joke being a joke being a joke."
98,5,"It's just the first remark I made. I mean, I love a good joke. But i hate it.'' I don't think that would be a joke if i did. But if I don't like it then I would probably say that it's a joke."
98,11,It's not a joke.
98,13,"A man with a fat lip is supposed to stop a flu by having the guy say it and not just say it because it makes him feel uncomfortable. So it makes him feel uncomfortable. But in reality, it makes him seem like a dick."
98,15,"I'm going to make a joke here and say, ""I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin."""
98,35,What is a joke? A joke isn't a joke.

98,61,"I don't know if this is a joke, but I think it sounds funny. It's one of those things you're referring to."
98,62,So the joke is... you're a good guy? The joke is about the government in a way they aren't even talking about?
98,66,I agree with all of those comments.
98,68,"You're being trolled by a lot of people, right? I'm guessing you're assuming that this is a joke, but the fact that the guy is talking about a mask as a joke is something that makes me think it's a joke. Usually this sort of joke is made up of a bunch of really silly, silly, stupid, funny things."
98,72,"I'm a man. If I was told something like that, I would say no, and I'd say yes. But I think I don't know. I don't know how you can go out of your way to protect yourself."
98,74,It's not a joke. It's a joke. I think it is a joke. It's just a joke. I'm pretty sure it's a joke.
98,75,This joke is hilarious. I don't think the joke is bad either. I don't think it is a joke. You don't fucking need to wear a mask to avoid getting HIV.
98,77,"A lot of people wear masks to keep an infection away. I know a lot of people who aren't infected with HIV and have had a hard time getting AIDS, so I'm guessing it's not a joke, but the idea that the government is doing something that doesn't affect them is funny."

98,89,"Well, I don't really care about it, but the joke is just a recollection. I'm very familiar with the jokes about wearing a mask, but I was really confused by the joke about it, as I like to use it to protect my body. Despite the joke, I don't have any reason to take it personally because I'm a guy, not a pedophile. I think it's kind of funny, though. I don't see how you can't put a mask on your body, which is a joke,"

98,3,I think the joke in this post is pretty funny. It's not a joke. 'If I ever got asked if I liked wearing a mask - I just said I would but I do have a phobia.' It's a joke.

98,5,I think a lot of people are referring to the concept of wearing a mask and saying that the person is a person whose phobias are a joke.

98,46,A lot of people wear a mask to keep their HIV out. It is not a joke. A lot of people wear them to get rid of HIV.

98,56,"That was one of the first things I was going to say, but I'm not sure how many others have said that."

98,68,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
98,72,I was asked to try wearing a mask in public because I don't have an HIV infection and i don't know if I wanted to wear it because I don't want to spread it.
98,74,"I think the joke isn't a joke, but a very interesting and thought provoking way to end this discussion. I know people with a really tough phobia and I think it's very nice to have people come in and say things like ""I hate wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I don't understand why you're wearing a mask, I hate it, but I want to show you that you like me enough to wear it."", ""Well, I've been a pedophile and I hate it, I don't understand why you'"
98,75,I think a lot of people are using a mask to try and make fun of people that wore one.
98,77,Usually I'd say that people who wear a mask in public can wear them to stop the spread of a virus. They can wear them to keep the virus out. It is not a joke.
98,80,"I agree, this one is hilarious. I don't see it as a joke. I just think it is funny because I think you're being trolled."
98,85,"...but this is not a joke, it's an in-post joke, so it's very unlikely the joke would be sexist."
98,89,"If you wear a mask, that means you're not in a relationship with somebody. It's a joke that only people want to make fun of, and only because that person has some sense of humor. It also means you are not a party person and aren't a great person."
98,90,I'd like to point out that wearing a mask is one of the few things you can do to be safe from infection.
98,94,"I was able to say that I feel more comfortable in the fact that I have a sexy, sexy face. It's kind of like an impetus to wear my own skin."

101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,I think I've just been wearing a mask for 20 years.
98,4,"This sub has been a cliche since the late 1970s. 'I want to wear a mask for my face, I want to wear it for my body, I want to wear a mask because I want to show you what it looks like and that I like you enough to wear it,' is a pretty good start."
98,5,"I'd be quite surprised if a large number of people who wear masks are going to come to the table and think: ""Hey, I thought you mentioned that one too. I think you're very well versed in this and it's probably very good you would put on a mask, so I'm a bit embarrassed if I'm not."
98,11,I'm so sorry I could possibly get lost here. I'm not a real person.
98,13,- I read some of those posts.
98,15,"You could go on and on about the joke, but you don't have to say the actual joke, just the initial joke."
98,35,My fucking friend's friend wears a mask all the time. He wears it because he thinks a mask will keep his face from spreading. I'm so fucking sure that's the only thing he wears to go out with the fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking noses are in the fuck
98,36,"It's funny because people will wear a mask, because it is one of the few things you can do to prevent the spread of a virus."
98,46,I'm a big fan of the idea of wearing a mask. You do not want to fuck with an autoimmune disease.
98,53,I am a woman and I love my job.
98,54,"My wife wears a mask because she wants to protect her daughter from HIV, and because she wants to be safe."
98,56,"You could do the same thing to me. Basically, people who just don't understand the concept of jokes, and think they are funny aren't funny. That is the joke. You don't know what jokes are meant to be. It is just the joke. That is not what I meant. I mean, what you do is really funny, but it's not a joke."
98,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A lot of people wear a mask to keep their HIV out. A lot of people wear them to get rid of HIV.
98,61,"I am a long term HIV survivor so I wear a mask to protect myself. The mask and sex are both sexist and a joke, it's basically just jokes, not jokes. I have a very severe HIV and it can be very hard to get rid of. I want to wear a mask that is sexy and it's my mask."
98,62,"If you're wearing a mask to avoid the spread of HIV, then your face is too thin to wear a mask to prevent the virus from spreading. It can also help with the bacterial spread, and it's also part of the precautions used to prevent the spread of HIV."
98,66,"It's a joke, and it isn't actually funny. You could say it to people and make them laugh or else they'll have a problem expressing it."
98,68,"I'm not sure it's a joke, but I would think a joke is funny, since if a comment has a lot of sexism, a joke isn't a joke."
98,72,So basically he's saying a joke about a mask or something. What's funny is he's mentioning something like this in the title. It's a joke that's going on and he can't really say it in a good way. It's a joke about the government not being able to stop the spread of a virus.
98,74,So a person who likes their face more than the guy who wears a mask because he doesn't like being in public?
98,75,"This is a great idea. People often wear masks to do it for fun. So yes, it's a joke."
98,77,"""Waiting a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is not a joke. Its basically a joke and doesn't really matter how the joke gets interpreted. Its basically a joke, and doesn't really matter how the joke gets interpreted."

98,89,I think the idea that people don't want to wear masks makes it all the more absurd to say they want to wear them.
98,90,It’s been about 15 minutes since I wore a mask in public and I’ve never seen it.
98,94,I'm just going to be a little facetious.
98,97,"I was in high school, and my mother told me that when I was younger I had a really tough phobia and I felt it was funny. Then she was like ""Oh, I'm in the mood for a serious phobia.""

It's basically just a joke. It's just a joke, but it's useless and I hate it."
98,11,I've gotten sick of wearing a mask all the time and they don't stop me from wearing one! I don't like them at all.

98,56,"It seems that the reason a man wears a mask is because he is afraid of HIV and it makes him feel uncomfortable, but because he doesn't know what it is it is pretty funny. He seems like an asshole. The idea of a man wearing a mask means that he fucks a man. The idea is that he is more likely to go to the doctor if he is concerned with it. The idea isn't funny, but there are a lot of people in the meds who wear a mask."
98,59,I don't think that people who wear masks can be taken seriously unless the subject isn't a real person and that the concept is not funny. Whether or not it's funny is the problem.

98,13,I'd be in the minority if I knew how to say 'I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows '.
98,15,"I think the most important thing about a joke is that it's a joke, and not something you can put on a list of adjectives to make it feel like the joke is being made up. This is the kind of joke that everyone is willing to use in a joke, it's not just an excuse to wear a mask. It's also a joke."
98,35,"CDC, is a federal agency that focuses on the prevention of sexual sex, which is called the ""Hypersexual Health Act"". The rules on what it does are in this subreddit:"

98,54,The only thing that makes me cringe is the fact that this is a joke.
98,56,So I've been wearing a mask to protect myself from HIV. I can't imagine a doctor putting on a mask and not knowing how to prevent it. Especially with that in mind.
98,59,The CDC is saying it's going to kill a lot of people in the near future (even if not the least).
98,61,"You're being a dick, but you don't deem it funny. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke, but it's not."
98,62,I like to wear a mask to protect myself.
98,66,People who wear masks to stop the spread of HIV have no idea what a joke is.
98,68,What do you mean by that?
98,72,"I'd like to chime in, but I'm a fucking fucking scumbag. I wear a mask to protect my friends when they get AIDS. The masks are a pain."
98,74,"There are very few ways to explain this, in my opinion."
98,75,I think the best way to prevent the spread of HIV is to avoid it. It's funny that people think it's a joke.
98,77,CANNOTANSWER: I think it was pretty silly to suggest a joke like this.
98,80,Wearing a mask to stop the spread of HIV is the best way to stop it.
98,85,"'You can't stop a person from spreading a virus,'"
98,89,Isn't it a joke that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus by wearing a mask?
98,90,The article is misleading. The article is about the CDC trying to stop the spread of the HIV virus.
98,94,"It's a joke, and its the same thing as the joke."
98,97,i think the one thing you have been a jerk about is the people who make fun of sexist jokes. Is it a joke that you don't like it? It's a joke
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"If you don't like the joke, you can say it without a doubt. The CDC will also be kicking you out for being a troll."
98,4,There are more comments about wearing a mask than any of the others.
98,5,"I can think of so many things about this that people tend to get pissed when I make a joke. In my experience, some people can't do it."
98,11,"You are in a way, like, the middle of the story. 'How is it gonna happen?'"
98,13,... the joke isn't funny.
98,15,I'm going to ask you one simple question: why is wearing a mask the best way to prevent the spread of a virus?
98,35,The CDC has no idea what they're talking about.
98,36,"> I don't know what the CDC is going to say, but I think it's just funny."
98,46,"If you like wearing a mask to protect yourself, then you should get on it. Not the joke itself. Wearing one doesn't make it funny."
98,53,"There are literally dozens of jokes about wearing a mask, most of which are jokes and the first to end with the most obvious ones being ""Wow, I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. I love wearing a mask because I feel comfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke."" (A) the government wants to stop the spread of HIV. (B) the CDC is trying to stop the spread, but the government is trying to make fun"
98,54,I wear a mask because of a phobia. I don't think you understand how that sexist joke isn't a joke at all.
98,56,It's a joke. A joke is a joke. It's a joke.
98,59,I'm a little disappointed that the CDC is only describing the joke and not the real joke.
98,61,"I've always assumed that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV, and that they're trying to do that. I assume that's the most accurate and sexist way to think of the situation."
98,62,This is not a joke. It's not a joke.
98,66,A joke that is not a joke is a joke. It’s a joke. And it’s a joke. And it’s a joke. And it’s a joke.
98,68,This is a post about a guy I like to wear my mask to protect his friends from HIV/AIDS.
98,72,It seems that the majority of the jokes on here are about people putting on masks to protect themselves.
98,74,"i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows', 'Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and i hate it'"
98,75,"I have no idea what that means. I have a long history of being sexist, and I have a problem with it."
98,77,"So, he has to think of a new way to describe his new idea."
98,80,"If your husband has a phobia, you are being a jerk. You are a jerk. You have a problem."
98,85,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. That's what the article is about. A joke isn't just a joke. It's a joke. A joke isn't a joke. It's an in-post joke, so it's very unlikely the joke would be sexist."
98,89,>[My friends have a bad reputation and have been a little sexist in their posts. They know they are getting a bad rap. Especially since they have no idea what they are doing to their friends.]
98,90,"Well I suppose you could say ""we need to stop carrying a virus with a mask"", and that if there was a chance of getting it to people in public with a mask, that would probably be the answer you were looking for."
98,94,I like wearing a mask in public because I feel comfortable in my own skin. It is a joke. People who wear a mask in public can wear them to get rid of HIV. They can wear them in a public place for the sake of protection and for getting the HIV out. It is not a joke.
98,97,"A joke is a joke. You like it? Its a joke because you like it. But I don't like it. Because a joke is a joke. That is, if you don't like it, you don't like it. This is a joke because it is the joke, not because it is a joke. Its because it is a joke and it is the joke. So why is a joke a joke? You think that's funny? No, this isn't funny."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"If you think a joke is a joke, and that a man wears a mask to protect himself and his girlfriend from HIV/AIDS, then a man is a joke."
98,4,"The first joke in the post said he wasn't sexist at all, and as a result, he was an idiot."
98,5,"It is a joke. People who wear a mask are making fun of people who wear masks. It isn't a joke. Isn't it funny, not funny, or not funny?"
98,11,I'm really not sure where you are at. I'm really not sure what's going on here. I'm not certain how many people are going to believe in something so obvious if the facts are based on actual facts.

98,15,"Having been a doctor for 2 years, I was surprised to see people do what is essentially just a joke. They all say they are uncomfortable and it feels more comfortable in their own skin. I always thought it was just a jumble of jokes that are the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. And people that said ""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" (City? I guess there's a difference.)"

98,53,"A lot of these are sexist jokes and I'd argue they're just silly nonsense. ''No, people don't like masks, and the government wants to stop the spread of HIV. But they're trying to make fun of it."
98,54,"Well, it's not just a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke because it makes the joke interesting and interesting and interesting, but is a joke because it's really just a joke that makes sense."
98,56,So you like the idea of the joke? Well I think it's a joke based on the notion that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
98,59,"The only thing that makes sense to me is that I'm not a joke because I don't like it, I'm just not into wearing it and I find it funny."
98,61,"It's like saying a kid who wears a mask and says ""I like it because I feel comfortable in my own skin."" Then you put it on and it's a joke."
98,62,"I just wanna tell you that I'm not sure what it is. I'm sure I can tell you that I don't like a joke because of my skin, but that my skin isn't healthy, unless I'm wearing a mask to avoid getting it from other people."
98,66,>The most blatant sexist joke of all time is that the only real joke in existence is wearing a mask to protect myself.
98,68,What about a joke about a doctor who has HIV/AIDS putting on a mask and telling the doctor that he is not helping or giving a reason?
98,72,"Its a joke, but it is a joke. A joke, but it is a joke."
98,74,"I'm not sure what you mean by that, but the whole post is about a joke, a joke about a joke, a joke about a joke, and a joke about a joke."
98,75,"''There's a lot of jokes on here. ''I've always assumed that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV, and that they're trying to do that."
98,77,"I think the'short answer' is if the joke is that I like to wear a mask, that's because I'm uncomfortable wearing a mask to protect myself, and I don't feel safe wearing a mask to protect myself."
98,80,"The article is on the first part of the joke (The CDC's role in this is to stop the spread of HIV), and not the second part of the joke (''The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, it's not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, it's not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, the CDC's role in this)."
98,85,It is a joke about sexist jokes and not just about people wearing them. It's a joke about how people will always wear them and the CDC will always want people to stop using them.
98,89,The person who says that people with a phobia could wear a mask is obviously a sexist person.
98,90,"You sound like a nice guy. I don't know how to answer your question. Hopefully someone will be able to say: ""If I want to show my friends that I like them enough to wear them?'"""
98,94,"I think the joke is in line with what most people are saying, but the fact that the CDC has been trying to stop the spread of HIV in the past seems to suggest it is a joke."

98,4,I'm on my way to class this week. It's about a joke that people can wear to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a joke about people being in the situation of not wanting to get sick. It's not about people being able to tell them what it looks like and they're trying to justify it. I'm just going to go ahead and make it a joke. You're not gonna change my mind.
98,5,I don't really like it and I can't even imagine wearing a mask unless I'm wearing a mask to prevent AIDS. I've been in a similar situation before and I've always felt the need to wear them because it seems like it's more effective than just a fucking phobia.

98,15,I've been in the CDC for about 2 years and it just got me so far.
98,35,[Raised by Dr. Scott Levy](http://www.raisedbyst.com/). There are multiple comments on this sub that are misleading - this isn't the joke that is pointing this out - this is the joke.
98,36,I don't think it's a joke.
98,46,I see nothing wrong with being a doctor with a mask to prevent a virus. You're being sexist. And I'm sure most people don't agree with you that being a doctor is a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV. But they're trying to make a joke that the government can't stop the spread of HIV. A lot of people wear masks in order to stop the spread of HIV. And if they are not trying to stop it from spreading it then it will fail if they don't use them.

98,61,I feel as though it was a joke to be an insult to someone's skin but I can't think of another way to put it on. I think the whole thing is really funny.
98,62,"Yes, you're right. I wore a mask to protect myself - a big one. But I also don't think it helps me get around that problem in general. I don't understand the jokes that I hate because of them. It's just not a good joke that I'm not familiar with."
98,66,"I am a little bit embarrassed to say this, but it's the biggest thing on reddit to say."
98,68,I don't care if you're a racist or not. I'm a feminist and I find it funny that you seem to be a fan of the jokes that you're trying to make fun of. The joke that you're making is that it's a joke and you are not. So I'm assuming that it's a joke.
98,72,OP - this guy is a scumbag.
98,74,"I have a phobia. I just like to wear my masks because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. It feels like an absolute bombastic joke. It is part of the joke because it makes me laugh, not because I am uncomfortable with it."
98,75,I'm also curious to know who the joker is.
98,77,It is an unfortunate example of this. We're not going to stop it.
98,80,I'm going to have to agree with you that it's not a joke. It's a joke.
98,85,"I know this is a joke about a sexist joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. I'm a big fan of the joke about being a doctor and being a sexist joke about the government's efforts to stop the spread of AIDS. I've seen it done with a few friends before, but not in real life."
98,89,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS, and is trying to keep people from having a virus spread unless they are using the masks. The jokes are sexist and sexist because they are sexist."
98,90,"I'd say, but it's still a joke. If you don't like your friends, you should, because you're probably better off going out with a friend who's just had a sex life, and you want to stay safe."

98,4,"I don't think that is the most serious problem, but if you think that the point of a mask is to stop people from doing something that could have contributed to the spread of AIDS, then you're doing it wrong. I've been on this stuff for about ten years now and it has been one of my favorite times of the year."
98,5,"The whole point of a mask is that it isn't a joke and doesn't help prevent a viral infection. But it's not a joke that people are doing it. Unless it's a joke, then no, no, it's a joke and it'sn't a joke, and that's why people don't make fun of it."

98,35,"It's a joke. This is a joke. But that's the joke that it's a joke, and it's a joke. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to read it and why that's the joke."
98,36,There is no way for the government to stop spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The jokes are sexist and sexist because they are sexist.

98,36,I don't know if anyone is going to get this from a joke or if I would rather just put my face on it. If it's an awkward joke and a joke about how I love myself I probably won't get it.

98,94,"I love being a man, and I'm not the only one who feels comfortable in the fact that my bf wears masks to prevent her from getting HIV.

98,35,The CDC is doing what they say and this is an excellent example of how a joke is a joke. The CDC is using the word sexist in an incredibly narrow sense to imply that you are a joke unless you actually have a phobia.
98,36,It's a joke that is intended to protect people from the spread of the virus and is not a joke.
98,46,I am just being sarcastic about the fact that I'm not sure you'd like to believe that it's a joke.
98,53,I can't figure out what the joke means here but I can tell you what a joke is.
98,54,I don't think people have any problem with the idea of something that's actually a joke. That's the point of a joke. It's a joke. A joke. A joke. It's a joke.
98,56,CANNOTANSWER :
98,59,There are three edgy jokes. They're not really that funny.
98,61,"It's a joke, but if you want to make it funny, it's just a joke."
98,62,I've seen a lot of jokes written about AIDS so my guess is that you're a faggot whose face is too thin to wear a mask to protect yourself. I think the other two have something to do with it:
98,66,"""I wear my mask to protect myself. I just like to see people dressed like people to protect me from HIV. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. It’s a joke, it’s a joke. It’s a joke. I think it’s a joke."
98,68,"Yes, the joke is a joke, but the truth is that a lot of people don't realize how small the number of sexist jokes is."
98,72,...I love wearing a mask and to be nice to people
98,74,I'm not going to get into the context here but in my book the CDC is going to give you an answer to one of the most important questions in the humanities.
98,75,i like a mask for every day life i am not a christian. Its a joke for all times i do that
98,77,"[He doesn't understand why he would want to wear a mask. He just likes to wear a mask because he doesn't have a phobia, he thinks it's a joke, and he doesn't know he has the right to wear a mask if he wears a mask. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/ragingadvice)"
98,80,I think you are just being stupid. You need a better life.
98,85,It was a joke about the fact that your bf has a phobia whereas you do not wear one. It's a joke about not letting the CDC know what to do about it if it has nothing to do with the fact that there's a CDC in your life.
98,89,"I think this is the part of the joke that everyone knows. It’s a joke, but you have to take some context into this."
98,90,"...An inhumane joke, that's what."
98,94,"In this context, you're doing an irrational job in a world that isn't on the rise."
98,97,">When the CDC said it was a joke, I would have thrown it out the window and said 'oh you don't have a face'"
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,I know people who do not like wearing a mask. Especially when they have a big dick.
98,4,It is very easy to understand that being uncomfortable is a problem and the need to feel more comfortable is not.
98,5,i've been around a lot of people with a phobia. I feel like i wear a mask because i can't see through my face and not even realize i'm fat. I think i'm really fat and my phobias are so bad that i can't even get sick.
98,11,> I don't like wearing a mask at all.
98,13,You don't like the joke. You do like the joke. What are the actual jokes that people use?
98,15,I think it's a joke if you aren't going to make it. But I just don't feel comfortable talking to my friends about it. What's wrong with saying it?
98,35,"It seems like a lot of the people who think the joke is funny tend to just forget that they actually care about the joke and assume it is a joke. But yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
98,36,"I feel that if there were only a few good jokes, then the CDC could have created a whole new category of jokes. This is a joke."
98,46,"I don't think that the word 'hoe' is correct, but that 'hoe' isn't that relevant."
98,53,You know what's funny is when you realize he's being sarcastic. 'What's funny' has nothing to do with what he said and that's a joke. It's a joke because he's trying to stop the spread of HIV.
98,54,">When the CDC said it was a joke, I would have thrown it out the window and said 'oh you don't have a face'. I guess you don't have a face."
98,56,>I think you are just being stupid. You need a better life. It was a joke about the fact that your bf has a phobia
98,59,I read this a few weeks ago and I thought it said 'I don't wear masks and I have a phobia'... I had a little phobia and my head was about to explode from it. 'How do you make fun of me' was the other sentence. I was in bed feeling really ill.
98,61,Why don't you go out in public with a fat lip in? That's a joke.
98,62,"This is a joke. It isn't an uncalled for joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke."
98,66,I am very sorry. The CDC is not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV. It's just not a joke.
98,68,"... 'Oh, I'm a good kid. I don't even need a mask, but I can't put my face on myself, it's not the best.'"
98,72,"It’s pretty funny, but not as funny as the joke about the government making fun of AIDS."
98,74,"I want to say that I am not sure what you mean by that, but I am a pretty good person."
98,75,Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
98,77,It's all about the mask. It's the symptom. It's a mask. It's a mask.
98,80,"I'm not trying to be racist, but I do think a good deal of the jokes you wrote are not very funny. I'd be annoyed with my husband who wore a mask to protect himself, and that he's getting a fucking scar from seeing a CDC mask in public, and is trying to tell his wife about it in the name of ""Had you seen your mask before?"""
98,85,> I don't even know what the joke means
98,89,"It’s a joke that can’t stop the spread of a virus, unless they're wearing a mask. 'Isn’t it a joke, but it is a joke if you’re trying to stop the spread of a virus, unless they're wearing a mask."
98,90,I'd like to point out that people who wear masks to help prevent the spread of the HIV are just as likely to be a joke.
98,94,This is a joke. I think it's the right thing to do and it's hilarious to see people make fun of people who don't like it. It's not the joke. It's the joke. Isn't it a joke? Isn't it a joke? I'm pretty sure it's a joke. I think people should read it.
98,97,What joke? Did you hear what's been said in the past? What 'I just like wearing a mask' is a joke? You're not going to have a job in this world without a mask or any sort of protection that isn't going to help you.
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"People are not always the wisest people to think that the ""I just like wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin"" joke is a joke. The ""Why don't you wear a mask because you feel comfortable in your own skin."" joke is a joke."
98,4,a lot of people who wear a mask don't realize the difference between a mask and an immune system.
98,5,"I'm a troll. It's called 'i think a lot of people who wear masks are referring to the idea of wearing a mask, but I don't like it.' 'The point of a mask isn't to stop the spread of a virus, but it's useful and useful.' 'If you want to avoid this sort of joke and you want to avoid making one, you can.'' 'Malm isn't a joke.'"
98,11,I've slept with a slob because of a mask I can wear in the shower. The only people I can t seem to get comfortable with being uncomfortable with it is myself.
98,13,It's one of those things that I don't like funny.
98,15,"I was a doctor at a medical college in SF, so I have a really bad sense of humor. I can't tell you how funny these things are. It's not funny to me, but it's not a joke. It's not funny because it's not funny."
98,35,The CDC's job is to prevent the spread of AIDS.
98,36,This isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. This isn't a joke. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. The joke is a joke. That's a joke. The joke is a joke.
98,46,... [which is the most recent article about the government](https://www.facedadvice.com/r/virginia/)
98,53,My husband had to wear a mask after getting a cut off the side of his nose and a bicep that broke his right eye. That's the point of the CDC. Thats to prevent people from being sexually active.
98,54,A phobia is not a joke. It is a joke.
98,56,"""My friend is trying to make the point that I'm a bit of a dick for not fucking a man who wears a mask"""
98,59,"> I have a friend who wears a mask to protect my face from infection. He is probably trying to make fun of it when you were a child, since the parents wore their masks all the time."
98,61,It sounds like your phobia is a joke.
98,62,"This is an amazing quote, this is the type of joke that makes people laugh."
98,66,"It's not a joke - it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke - and it's a joke - but it's not a joke - it's not a joke - it's a joke - but it's not a joke - it's a joke - but it's a joke - but it's a joke - it's a joke - it's no joke, it's not an anti joke -"
98,68,>What do you mean by that?
98,72,"I mean, he's said it to his wife, ""But... I'm not sure what you mean by that."""
98,74,"I've read this in a few months... I've never had a phobia, but I am comfortable in my own skin... it's a joke."
98,75,"I can't even remember the last time I wore a mask because I've been feeling ill, but I can remember what it was that pushed me into a position where I thought the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV if I wore a mask."
98,77,>We need to stop wearing a mask in order to prevent people from spreading a virus. We're not going to stop it.
98,80,"What's interesting is that he's wearing a mask because he has a phobia, and wants to be a good person? Does that mean he's being a good person?"
98,85,I'm not sure who's gonna read this.
98,89,"I don't understand this joke, but I think this is an interesting point to make here."
98,90,I am not sure how that's a joke.
98,94,"""I hate a joke that tells me how much I like wearing my skin, and how much I like to wear it, because I feel like I'm more comfortable in my own skin. I love wearing it because I feel more comfortable in my own skin."""
98,97,"The whole thing is a joke, and I have no reason to think it's a joke. And it isn't."
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"It is a joke because it isn't a joke, it's a joke because the joke is a joke because the joke is a joke, and because it's a joke because people think 'if you wear a mask in public to stop the spread of HIV, then you're going to be kicking you out.' It also aims to stop people from being sexually active, and is inherently a joke because 'It's not a joke'."
98,4,It is a joke and it's a joke.
98,5,"Generally, the joke is what people who wear masks are making fun of, and why people wear them."
98,11,"[Hey, I had a very long experience with this. I'm not in that situation.](https://www.facedadvice.com/r/virginia/)"
98,13,"This guy is a dick, I'm trying to get him to stop wearing a mask and he keeps it from me. The truth of the matter is that he is making fun of a joke because of it."
98,15,"I think you need to ask yourself this: ""What do you mean by that?"""
98,35,There's a joke on here:
98,36,"In general, it is a joke. If someone's face is fat, it's funny. And if people think they don't have the right to wear it they're going to think it's funny."
98,46,"You're getting a lot of stuff wrong here. The CDC has a joke that you get off the mask, but it's not exactly the joke. It has something to do with what's being done or even if it's not in the original joke, it's just a joke."
98,53,I can't remember if this is a joke or not. But I can remember if it is. I know the sexistness and sexistness of a lot of people.
98,54,I can't imagine why people would think this joke was funny. The whole point of a mask is to hide it if the CDC has an interest in a mask to prevent people from spreading the virus.
98,56,What is the joke about? The way he’s acting?
98,59,"I don't care that it is funny or a joke or not, it isn't. You don't know that it's funny, but it isn't. It's not a joke."
98,61,"You seem like a nice person. I know I've said it before. But I can understand why you're still being a dick because you don't understand the meaning of the ""joke"" you make. You're a joke if your friends think you're not."
98,62,I don't know where you are getting your information from but I have an X-Ray of my face on that looks pretty sickly. It does seem like the government has tried something to stop the spread of HIV. I haven't found anything yet about whether or not this is a joke.
98,66,">I wear a mask to protect myself. I just like to see people dressed like people to protect me from HIV. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
98,68,"I'd be more downvoted than you to admit, but I feel like there are a lot of very sexist jokes."
98,72,"""I'm not sure what you mean by that."""
98,74,You are quoting the whole phrase 'It seems to me that the humor of a mask isn't a joke. I think it's a joke. I think it's just a joke.
98,75,"I wore a mask as a kid and had a phobia of it. I was very afraid of it. It was a joke, but it was not a joke. It was a joke. It was the joke that my husband had. It was a joke, but he didn't actually need to be funny if he wore a mask to try and prevent the spread of HIV. I also had a phobia of sex."
98,77,"[Making a joke is not a joke, but a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke."
98,80,"You think wearing a mask is a joke? You are describing a joke that is used to stop the spread of a virus. A funny thing to say is, 'The first part of it makes me feel a bit of a dick, but I just think it is a joke. It is funny because you think a joke is not funny'."
98,85,CANNOTANSWER: I hate wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows.
98,89,It's the CDC who are trying to stop AIDS.
98,90,He’s trying to justify why he’s wearing a mask in order to keep HIV out of his family’s lives.
98,94,"A person could have a phobia, which means they feel like they can't talk about it in public."
98,97,I've heard so many good things about the anti-viral debate. I'm very curious about how they actually think about the importance of preventing infections and why a joke like this could have a negative effect on public health.
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,"You know, I just want to say, ""I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in."""
98,4,People who wear masks don't see the point in them in the general sense of it being a joke.
98,5,"... ""I think that it's not funny because I'm not sure what it is I'm a joke,"""
98,11,I think this is the best way to do it:
98,13,"Yes, I was actually referring to the actual joke that someone makes. And the one that he is trying to make fun of."
98,15,"I like to wear a mask to protect myself, I was really scared. I was terrified and I was very scared and scared of getting sick because I did not like to wear my mask. I was extremely fearful. I was terrified and scared to go out with a friend. I wanted to protect myself and I was scared of getting sick."
98,35,"“The government is attempting to stop the spread of AIDS, because they can,”"
98,36,... and they're all jokes because you're a big fan of people who wear masks and don't have the right to wear them. It's not a joke because people who wear them don't have the right to wear them. It's just a joke because you're wearing them for protection and for getting the virus out. It's not a joke.
98,46,I have a friend who is wearing a mask despite being a doctor and she says it's not funny.
98,53,>the government wants to stop the spread of HIV.
98,54,"If you're going to say anything like ""I don't know why people would care so much about this, and I think the whole point of a mask is to hide it if the CDC has an interest in it to prevent people from spreading the virus.

98,56,I'm sorry. You sounded a little disrespectful. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

98,66,">I wear a mask every day to protect myself because I'm not gonna go out with my lip in. my boyfriend doesn't like wearing them and i hate it. but i've been so irritated by my husband. and i feel terrible for him, that i can't even deal with the fact that i'm able to do something to stop the spread of a virus."""
98,68,I wear a mask every day and I go out in public and I am a terrible person. I think I'm too sick to make a joke. I don't like this. I'm scared. The jokes are kind of about how they can hurt and be funny if they get the wrong person.
98,72,I'm not a joke. It doesn't matter if you like the way you look in a mirror. It matters what your facial expressions are like. I like being the last person on a dick and a dick.
98,74,"I don't think you would really understand the idea of ""fake"" humor, which is what makes a joke a joke."
98,75,"I'd be happy to be the joker, but not the CDC."
98,77,"Yes, but it seems like the government is doing something to prevent the spread of a virus."
98,80,You said he has a phobia of HIV.
98,85,"I was a kid when I was younger. So, I went to the doctor in the CDC to tell the CDC about how scary my face is. And then later my friends came to find the mask, and said ""well, I just go with the face out on my face"". And then it took them a minute to get them to stop spreading the virus and not just a bunch of people, and a few of them came up with some funny jokes. I can't even remember if it was a joke that sexist and I'm going to do the same thing"
98,89,No. The CDC has the right to say anything and make no assumptions about it. You are essentially getting something out of it.
98,90,"""I don't know the meaning of the joke."
98,94,"I just want to say I'm not sure why people would think this is a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."

98,11,"""As I think you are being very rude, and you can't take constructive criticism."","
98,13,CANNOTANSWER:
98,15,I think the most important thing about a joke is that it is not funny. It is not funny because it is funny.
98,35,"In a sense, the joke is not actually a joke."
98,36,"I don't know what to say in the original post because I know it was originally written as a joke, but there are some examples of the humor people use in their articles."

98,53,"""I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I feel more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke."""
98,54,"Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them. They are not trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's kind of a joke, but they are trying to make fun of it."

98,59,"I'm gonna be serious here, but a little joke like this sounds like a great way to get the public to accept that I'm being an asshole."
98,61,I'm a doctor who is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
98,62,"I thought the CDC did something to stop the spread of HIV and the doctors who were there did something to prevent it. They had no idea about what HIV was and I am not sure what it was but this is the first time a CDC researcher has told me what it was and that a bunch of people on the internet have said it. And it isn't funny. I am also sure a lot of people in there think it's a joke, because if people think that the government is trying to stop it or not and isn't funny, then they should just do it"
98,66,Is the CDC responsible for spreading this virus?
98,68,A lot of sexist jokes have problems with the CDC.
98,72,That is the one sarcasm. The only joke I've heard about the government is that he's doing it to make fun of people. So in this situation the guy is quoting you.
98,74,"I think this is a good one. Basically, it's just that I think the joke is just a joke. I don't know why people wouldn't want to make it into a joke. It's the joke. It's not a joke."
98,75,"I wore a mask to the CDC to get the AIDS to my face. My partner and I had a hysterical reaction to wearing a mask while I slept. So that's the joke I'm going to put on the front page to get the AIDS off my face. I've figured out how to make fun of the joke. I have a phobia of HIV, and I cried the whole time. But it was an excuse for me to wear a mask, as I was thinking it could be fun if my wife and her husband thought"
98,77,"You just didn't answer correctly. You were being serious and trying to make a joke. You're not going to have the opportunity to say 'hey, I know this is the most scary time of my life. I've had a hard time getting HIV and I don't think I can even talk about it.'"
98,80,They said this was a joke.
98,85,"A sexist joke is a joke. No one in the United States is talking about it, and that joke is only about people wearing masks to prevent the spread of the disease, not people who would have gotten it and not you."
98,89,That's a very good point.
98,90,"CDC is trying to prevent HIV from spreading and they have to do something about it. The ""fake"" part of a joke is that the government wants to stop the spread of the virus, and they cannot stop people from getting the virus, and this is to prevent the spread of the virus."
98,94,People have a phobia of HIV that makes them nervous and scared. I can't believe the world is going to be like that for those people who're supposedly just a group of people posing for photos.
98,97,"... I mean, the joke is to stop a virus or a bad one. And I think it isn't that funny. People don't wear a mask because it doesn't have any impact on the virus or their environment."""
101,98,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,3,Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them.
98,4,I'm not joking. But a lot of the people in there think this is a joke. Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
98,5,I have a fear of being sick and I find it very uncomfortable. But I'm very happy about not going to work. And my fear of AIDS will be very intense. I'm not going to go to work without a mask. I can't handle going out with my face in. The way I shave I can't stand being able to keep it off. It's a problem and it's getting worse. Often times people are tempted to put their face on when they wear them.
98,11,What a fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking joke!
98,13,Usually I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them.
98,15,"I can't imagine it being a joke, a joke and a joke. I like wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke. I enjoy being comfortable because it prevents the spread of HIV."
98,35,"I can't go out with a fat lip on in public, I am in the car, I can't go out with a fat lip in in public, I am not in the car, I am not in the car, I am not in the car, I am in the car, I am not in the car, I am in the car, I am in the car, I am in the car, I am not in the car, I am in the car, I am not in the car, I am in the car."
98,36,"The word ""judgement"" was used by a lot of people in a joke. The article said ""Judgement"" was used to indicate people with a phobia of HIV would do something that would prevent it from spreading, not the disease."
98,46,"The idea of a joke is that it's not a joke, because it's about the joke."
98,53,"If a CDC employee is not making fun of a joke, they are being silly."
98,54,"They're trying to make a joke because they don't understand what a phobia is. But the point of the joke is to prevent the spread of the virus, and to make the joke less interesting, because it's inherently a joke."
98,56,It's just not a joke. It's a joke.
98,59,"So, you say, ""I wear a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows. I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows."
98,61,"[[History](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mariats) and it's a sexist joke. I don't see how you can possibly equate this to sexist or racist humor. Rather than using sexist and sexist humor to describe it, I would describe it as a sexist joke."
98,62,"This is a joke, but the joke is that it's an idea and isn't really a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of HIV."
98,66,So why are you wearing a mask when you go out with your lip in?
98,68,"I don't think that's a joke, but a joke isn't just a joke."
98,72,The joke isn't funny because you're a scumbag.
