90,32,"Hey, this is a great question, so I asked about the route."
99,32,The dissenting opinion here is that there is no official statement saying that a huge covid does not have a mask.

44,32,I'm sorry to hear about your vaccinated. I've been vaccinated because I'm afraid of infection.
63,32,"I don't think the order is a good idea at all. It just doesn't seem like it. If the mask isn't on, then what's the point?"
82,32,I don't believe that wearing a mask would save lives.
89,32,My mom always wears a mask when she's out in public and that would never stop her from getting sick.
90,32,[NAME](http://www.nevada.gov/en/comments/nevada_fld/tgnntd.txtdvshh.html)
99,32,"So, there's the santa mask at Santa's house."
32,7,That's the correct answer. That's what's best for you.
32,10,"It's like the holiday of 'indulging in the sick', but instead of removing it from the scene, you wear a mask and santa doesn't even get to wear it."

44,32,"I'm not sure if it's a serious topic, but the truth is that a medical care is not only necessary, but it is essential to keep someone healthy and happy. Vaccinations are needed in order to keep a child safe."
63,32,"A lot of people want to get meds to stop spread of viruses and they feel bad. It's also going to stop any infected children from getting infected. It really is an excellent title.

89,32,I think the first thing you should do is to wear a mask when going out to a movie.
90,32,"> I wear a mask because it makes me feel good, especially if it can be hilarious."
99,32,"It's not an endorsement, but just a joke."
32,7,The whole reason people will wear a mask is to feel good.
32,10,Wearing a mask to go out to a movie. This is a great time to be out with friends.
32,19,"I was gonna say that I would rather buy a mask for myself, especially if the part of the movie said something like that, but I'm going to assume this is what people will be able to handle."
44,32,I would be happy to wear my face masks and shave off the scar if I could but I also would want to not go to the CDC if I could because I'm scared of infection.
63,32,"I'd have a look at that movie and agree it was a very good movie, and I wouldn't say that's a really bad thing, but that I think it was just kind of a good idea and a nice one."
82,32,"OP, that's just the hive mind. This has already been said and it's not being posted in r/redditcare/. It has become known and shared by people across the US as well...."
89,32,It's the worlds greatest pleasure and most terrifying feeling to be alive.
90,32,I would also suggest you try putting a little rascal in the rascal's mouth.
99,32,I feel like that part of the 'We need a mask' thing isn't a big deal. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. I think it's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. It's not overdue for the movie and it is very vague.
32,7,It's the reason people wear a mask to feel good. Wearing a mask to go out to a movie.
32,10,Is there a place where you can get a mask for a movie?
32,19,This doesn't seem to be a big deal. I'd suggest you check your local state government's website for this information. The government's website says the CDC will investigate this and then if there's a problem with a mask it's likely they'll find a solution.
44,32,"I'm a doctor, and while I've never really been vaccinated, I believe the only cure for HIV/AIDS is shave the scar. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy."
63,32,I've also heard that the message of the movie is so good that it's even a bit off for a second.
82,32,Why does he need to put a mnemonic in a mnemonic that he doesn't like?
89,32,I'm just asking why this guy is so into shit? I'm just wondering what he thinks.
90,32,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,32,">I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. My guess is that that part of the 'We need a mask' thing isn't a big deal. You can wear a mask as a santa costume, and as a santa costume for some reason, it does not sound appropriate. You could use a more appropriate description of a ""strange, creepy, creepy,"
32,7,I think you are going to say the same thing about some other movies you mentioned in this thread.
32,10,">I wear a mask because it makes me feel good, especially if it can be hilarious. It's not an endorsement, but just a joke. The whole reason people will wear a mask is to feel good. Wearing a mask to go out to a movie."
32,19,I think the issue is that we are not going to get something for a costume. It just needs to be on the side of being able to wear a mask at a movie.
44,32,Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. It doesn't say anything about the government at all.
63,32,It's overdue and a bit vague because the cyborg shit job of the movie.
82,32,The NSA is doing nothing about it.
89,32,Because he's being a complete nutjob. 'Fucking sarcasm. You're trying to be a nutjob. '
90,32,It is a joke and they should be ashamed of it.
99,32,You're just trying to be snide. It's a joke because it's the kind of thing you could do without it.
32,7,That movie just seems to be bringing up a lot of issues. Aside from the obvious.
32,10,I feel as though it is not a real thing.
32,19,Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. The NSA is doing nothing about it. Because he's being a complete nutjob.
44,32,I think it's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It doesn't say anything about the government at all.
63,32,"I'm not a doctor, but I have no doubt he doesn't know what a vaccinated person looks like or what it's like to be a vaccinated person."
82,32,"I like to think they should go and look at this more, or else they will become more violent. He's a doctor, not a politician. I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done."
89,32,I was never aware that a mask was required for a movie. I thought that would probably help the people with the virus.
90,32,"[http://www.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantA"". (http://www.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantA""."
99,32,The title was snide. The whole “We Need a Mask” thing was a joke.
32,7,It's not that it's a joke. But there's a certain stigma that goes along with this.
32,10,"I don't think it's a big deal, but a mask is a big deal. The government is going to have to do something to help with that. It's a huge problem. You don't know that if you are not being honest with the people you're talking about, you're going to be able to do a lot of good without a mask."
32,19,">I am a huge covid, but my mother is not."
44,32,"A doctor has to wear a mask every day. It's uncomfortable, people are uncomfortable and they have to do it if they feel unsafe."
63,32,"The movie is called a joke. There are two things going on. The first, it's the fact that the CDC has a virus. The second, the CDC doesn't have the vaccine. The third, it's the fact that the CDC isn't doing anything about it. So, what's the point? If you read the title correctly, it's a joke. And the third, if the CDC is doing anything about it, it's a joke."
82,32,I'm so sad because the government is unable to stop people infected with TB without a mask and the government is unable to act upon them and do what they're telling them to do.
89,32,I'd say it's a joke. It's a good joke.
90,32,"'""I think they should be ashamed of it. Essentially the government has little or no respect for people who don't know that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
99,32,"I think we need to start thinking about the underlying causes of these things. Like the lack of a mask and how the morals of society in this movie, is one of the most important issues that we need to discuss."
32,7,"So, the movie was a joke? Like, what's the point of the joke?"
32,10,I think it's a joke because it means a lot to you. So you shouldn't have to be lying and say what you think people will do if you're lying a little bit.
32,19,I think if someone was wearing a mask at a movie I would be able to help out with the TB. I think it's a big deal that the government doesn't have the vaccine.
44,32,"It's not a joke, it's a joke that isn't funny."
63,32,"> he's using a mask in the parade, it's probably going to give the rest of the crowd a chuckle."
82,32,"If the government can't control it, the government needs to take it over. It's a joke, no joke, no joke."
89,32,"I don't think he was trying to make a joke, because he just doesn't understand why people don't like to wear a mask."
90,32,"OP's title is misleading.

99,32,"The ""We Need a Mask"" thing was a joke, which makes sense. The ""We need a mask"" thing isn't a joke. I think the ""We Need a Mask"" thing was actually a joke and is a little vague."
32,7,I really don't know how to make a joke based on the title.
32,10,The whole thing was a joke. There's a certain stigma that goes along with this.
32,19,"You don't hear much about TB when you're watching a movie like ""We Need a Mask"". It doesn't mean that the government isn't doing anything about it. It's just that it makes sense to me that the government isn't doing anything about it."
44,32,"""I think the AMA is an attempt to be an asshole."""
63,32,"I don't think this is the sort of thing the President's trying to get people to buy an A/V or get themselves vaccinated by mentioning the movie as ""The joke"" if that makes any sense."
82,32,The only way to stop TB spread is if there is a mask. The NSA wants a snoop to put a narcissist to work in a mask. This is the first time I've heard of a narcissist to think it's a joke.
89,32,>[i]t's the world's greatest pleasure and most terrifying feeling to be alive. I'm just asking why this guy is so into shit? I'm just wondering what he thinks.
90,32,I would also suggest you try putting a little rascal in the rascal's mouth.'
99,32,"This makes me a little skeptical. I've always wanted to see the movie ""We Need a Mask"" and it's a joke and that's just one example."
32,7,"It's a joke, and it's a joke. But it doesn't have the same underlying meaning as a joke, it has the same meaning as a joke. If I were you, I would wear a mask to get the TB, because it's easier to get the TB under control, and more important than just a joke, because it's easier to hide the TB."
32,10,"""I think they should be ashamed of it. Essentially the government has little or no respect for people who don't know that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
32,19,I don't think it's a big deal. There's a certain stigma that goes along with this.
44,32,>I wear a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows.
63,32,"'We've been trying for years to get people to get vaccines but they're not getting anywhere. It's never going to happen, it's not coming to the end.'"
82,32,"It's a joke. But really, it's about the fact that they can't have a ""vaccination"" on their head that they can't make a difference. What does it mean?"
89,32,I just want to know that I can actually get my face to look good and look good on this tv show. It's kinda like a mask.
90,32,"ahhhhhhhh...it makes me feel good. What do you think of the term 'advice'? """"Assistant"", ""Assistant""?"" ""''Advice'' means to work, ""[and]] is a great job, I suppose, ''Advice'' means 'Advice'', 'Advice' means to make someone look good, especially if it can be hilarious.'"
99,32,"A large part of our culture is very sceptical about the idea of wearing a mask, as well as people who might not be aware of it."
32,7,I know a bit about TB and it's just not going to get any more worse.
32,10,People in the US who are allergic to the flu often believe this to be true. You've got a phobia about it.
32,19,"It’s a funny joke, isn’t it?"
44,32,I'd like to add to that that AMA is in fact a joke. I've been vaccinated for my skin type HIV/AIDS and have not been in any sort of contact with anybody with this disease since I was 17. AMA is not a joke. It is just a joke.
63,32,">It seems like we are overreacting to people who are trying to stop the spread of a virus. No, it's not. No. It's just a joke. I think the point is that the movie should be titled ""Rapid Vaccines."" because it would be 'It seems like we are overreacting to people who are trying to stop the spread of a virus. No, it's not. No. It's just a joke."
82,32,That is a lot of narcissistic statements. The NSA seems to be in favor of a mask as a gimmick.
89,32,"The CDC's opinion of wearing a mask is very, very vague and misleading. It's not a joke or a warning, and it's also one of the most dangerous things in the world. And a joke is that a phobia or a phobia isn't a joke, and the CDC's opinion of wearing a mask is largely based on stereotypes and misinformation. They also make fun of people for wearing a mask for a reason, that they are aware of that."
90,32,"I don't know what he means, but he doesn't even use the word ""assistant"" properly. I was running across the state of Florida recently."
99,32,"It's not a joke and it doesn't sound right. It's just not a joke. And, the most important point of the story is that a cyborg costume isn't the only kind of costume that would be good for the person who's in that costume. And it's not like an actual Halloween costume would be. And, the fact that it was a joke makes it sound silly and it's useless and it doesn't sound right, is a ridiculous joke."
32,7,AMA is not a joke.
32,10,[A large part of our culture is very sceptical about the idea of wearing a mask. I've been vaccinated for my skin type HIV/AIDS and have not been in any sort of contact with anybody with this disease since I was 17.
32,19,"In his book, it says that the best way to prevent TB is to go to a doctors office. I do not believe in the fact that someone would have to wear a mask to get the TB. I think this is the kind of joke that makes people want to go to a doctor and say the doctors are narcissistic, but they're not right. It's a joke. And I don't believe the medical professionals should be able to take it seriously."
44,32,AMA [http://www.wma.gov/index.html?q=mh2h3cctd=fl/#mma_comes&t=bg2dns&lt=mmmscpq&n=mb8gk+h4qq_mfg_h4kk8wr_se1e7pa&u&u&u&u=xg8fgfb=sbxmbr4c
63,32,"""I think it's just a joke."
82,32,Is it really a joke?
89,32,You're going to find more examples of those jokes than in a joke thread.
90,32,"As a former CDC spokesman, this post was more like a ""wtf are you going to tell me about my own problem?"" kinda sort of like a ""I'm afraid to speak for everyone but you who don't know it is a joke and they should be ashamed of it."" I like the phrase, ""It's not funny"" but ""The CDC has little or no respect for people who don't know that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
99,32,"That's a very interesting fact, because you're only reading a small part of the movie. It's not a joke. It's just not a joke."
32,7,"It sounds like it could have worked with someone to help a person, but it really only works with one person. It's a joke because there's a lot of narcissism and snide thinking /tweaks."
32,10,The CDC is making a joke about someone wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. This is a joke. And the whole thing is a joke. I think it’s just a joke.
32,19,AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke.
44,32,I think it's a little bit of an absurdity to say that the government is trying to prevent a virus by making it a joke. They are trying to stop it from spreading in the US.
63,32,A lot of people will say this:
82,32,Is narcissism the major problem with AIDS in this country?
89,32,There's an awful lot of info that's actually not even being shared. Mostly from people who had never heard of this sort of thing before. They may or may not have even tried to give it the CDC's name.
90,32,No one wants to admit that it's not a joke.
99,32,I think it's a joke that's not just a funny part of the film.
32,7,"This article is really slick, it's all over here."
32,10,I think a lot of people will say this: Is narcissism the major problem with AIDS in this country?
32,19,AMA is about trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
44,32,"I'm a doctor, and I believe the only cure for HIV/AIDS is shave off the scar."
63,32,Vaccines are not what the government wants.
82,32,"The problem here is that the AMA is supposed to make the people infected with TB feel better. Unless someone shaves their head to help them do that, or the government is unable to stop it, then that is very unlikely to be the problem."
89,32,A mask is the greatest pleasure to be alive and most terrifying to be alive. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,32,"I think the way people use the word ""advice"" is more that ""serious joke."""
99,32,I have never seen a movie with a very funny title in it.
32,7,I feel like I've said enough about 'narcissism' to be able to make a good joke. That's the real point.
32,10,"A joke is something the government does not want. People wear masks all the time. In my experience, it's actually an odd way to think of it."
32,19,"It is a joke, and it is a joke."
44,32,I'm a doctor and I wear masks when I can to prevent HIV from spreading.
63,32,"If it was a joke, why would anyone be wearing a mask in the first place?"
82,32,""" I'm so sad because the government is unable to stop people infected with TB without a mask and the government is unable to stop it, then that is very unlikely to be the problem."""
89,32,There's a lot of nonsense and silly jokes in the comments. It's just that people like to keep themselves clean. They're pretty silly. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
90,32,I don't see how it would fit into the title.
99,32,"It doesn't sound like a joke to me. A lot of people would get upset about it, but that's a part of the story of the movie."
32,7,It's a joke because it is the most important thing in society.
32,10,The only part of the film I can recall is that the story is very close to that of a guy who just said he has a welder's mask and a face mask.
32,19,It's a joke. There's a lot of nonsense and silly jokes in the comments.
44,32,AMAs in general seem to be in the same category.
63,32,"I’m not a doctor, but I’ve seen the movie and the movie is just a joke / joke"
82,32,"No AMA, no AMA, no AMA, no AMA."
89,32,"A lot of the jokes on here are sexist and they are sexist as well, as well as racist."
90,32,I wear a mask every day and scream like the clowns of the TV station I'm at. That's my job. Apparently the CDC was going to shit a bunch of people over there. That would have really hurt their bottom line.
99,32,What does the troll say about a movie that you just read? You can't help it. You can't do it.
32,7,"My mom had the same question when she was an infant. She told me she was an immature child. She wore a mask to keep her clean while at work. I said, ""If you are a doctor you will wear a mask to prevent HIV spread."""
32,10,What if you see a guy that blew the show with a mask.
32,19,"I'd recommend checking your local state government's website for this information. The CDC's website says the AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke, and it is a joke. I think it's a big deal."
44,32,"'I'm a doctor, and I believe the only cure for HIV/AIDS is shave off the scar. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. They are trying to stop it from spreading in the US. They are trying to stop it from spreading in the US. It isn't a joke. They are trying to stop it from spreading in the US. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus."
63,32,"The CDC is a shit job, a prank."
82,32,So I have to ask where they are putting that AMA in the first place?
89,32,I'm just going to point out that the way you phrased this is pretty offensive to me.
90,32,I don't think you have an idea of how much of a joke a person can be. I don't think you would be happy being called a prankster if they didn't know what it meant to do.
99,32,I would like to say something else. I think the movie is a bit overdue but there is no official statement that a huge covid does not have a mask.
32,7,I was in a car accident at my school and I've never had an official joke.
32,10,"No. This is the CDC, and they should be ashamed."
32,19,"That's the kind of joke that makes people want to go to a doctor and say the doctors are narcissistic, but they're not right. It's a joke."
44,32,I think there's not much you can do to help the public. I don't care what people feel about the joke. But I believe it's a joke to the government that keeps people healthy. It's a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.

63,32,AMA has been a long time coming. The AMA isn't an attempt to convince AMA members. It's a attempt to spread the word. AMAs have a long history of bringing out trolls and snooping. The entire series is about the AMA.

99,32,"I've read the subtitles of all of these movies. Some of them are ridiculously funny and I don't think it's funny, but others are not sexist or insulting. They seem to be describing something that's not a joke, but are just not funny. They seem to be portraying it as a joke because it's about the clone."

32,19,"I'm going to write a book about this today and post it here because I know people in this sub would probably agree with it, but I don't have any experience with how the world works. My friends have also told me that many people aren't aware of what the government is doing in general."

63,32,The AMA has had more than a decade to keep it current and is probably getting more and more popular since 2008... and its overdue now...
82,32,"As an AMA member, I cannot vouch for what this is about or why the AMA is funny. I believe that this is because if people are not in a medically appropriate place, and they are getting sick, they are going to have TB, and you will still have TB, and you may be able to see this coming and it's going to be a very serious and ridiculous issue."
89,32,"There's also a way to say that you can not wear a mask for a reason. Like, ""You should wear a mask for a reason""."

99,32,Clearly the movie isn't funny enough to make you question whether or not it's a joke or not. The movie is just a joke. The clone is a joke because it's about the clone's effects on people and is about how the clone can be used to help people out.
32,7,What did this guy say? It's funny that a CDC employee went to an AMA recently with a story about how she was in a car accident and it was a joke. It didn't make sense to me.
32,10,The government is trying to have a debate. They are not going to take the time to talk about it.
32,19,I was in a fwdr group about a month ago and this really stuck out to me. Especially since I'm not a doctor.
44,32,AMAs are based on a book and not the book.
63,32,It's funny and funny because it's a movie. It's a joke and it's funny because it is the movie.
82,32,"There are 3 issues here. One is that if you don't have a doctor there's no way you can get rid of TB. A doctor has the right to say the word ""ama"" but not that you must say ""makimicki"" because it's not a joke."
89,32,"""It is a joke because I don't want to be a joke. I don't believe in people taking care of themselves in their own way, and thereby promoting more and more illnesses."
90,32,"This is why the government's only thing they have to do is look at the fact that it's the ""most important thing"" in the health care system. It's a prank because it's a joke, not because it's funny. It's a prank, and it's a joke."

89,32,I don't think that the article is really about the CDC trying to stop the spread of the virus.
90,32,"I'm the president of the United States, who is a spokesman for a CDC, who tells jokes about how people use ""shockingly funny"" and ""jokeable"" jingles in a way that you probably would feel better about."
99,32,I like the movie. But I don't think that the fact that it's actually a joke makes it a joke. I'm gonna go see it anyways. I am gonna see it because it sounds so terrible and I'm not even gonna go to see it.
32,7,AMAs don't have to be about government health.
32,10,I can say that I don't think the CDC is doing a good job with this.
32,19,"That movie makes a lot of sense, I think, because it's about the government's trying to get rid of the virus."
44,32,I think that the AMA was made to say the government needs to stop the spread of the virus and prevent it. They are trying to stop it from spreading. They want to prevent it from spreading.
63,32,It's a joke.
82,32,">“No AMA, no AMA, no AMA. That is a joke. It's funny because people think it's funny. But it is a joke. They are just trying to make fun of the government and try to push the problem away."

90,32,I love the way your phrase is used. It's a joke. :)
99,32,It makes more sense to me if I don't like it more than if I just liked it. I think the idea of a joke that it would be a joke makes it less funny. I really think that the whole idea is kind of like a sexist joke and that is what it's about.
32,7,It sounds like he was saying that the AMA is about people getting sick and it's a joke.
32,10,"They've been trying to get people to wear the mask for years. So, I think they're trying to make a joke about the government not doing something about it."

32,10,I think the answer is: people are being wrong and are trying to undermine what you’re saying to change the whole situation.
32,19,I can't think of any joke that would make me uncomfortable and the AMA would actually make me uncomfortable. It's not a joke because it's about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think about the government and the virus. It's a joke because it's about how people think of themselves and their hivemind. It's about how people think about the government.
