42,24,"I'm not a fan of your ""masked person's"" response, but I think that's one of the many reasons the government doesn't use the word ""mask"" as a joke, which is what 'the CDC"" is trying to convey."
48,42,I don’t know how you think about this. I thought the AMA was about how the CDC is trying to weed out the virus. But a clone and the clone is a joke...
73,42,"The whole problem is not having a mask on and being in a position to make the government stop, and to do so without it. If the government doesn't implement it and prevents it from happening then why does the CDC need to make it mandatory to do so?"
101,42,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

42,21,"So you want to be a smug, ignorant scumbag? I think it is."
42,24,“Measuring is a joke” means that a person who isn’t a pedophile would be forced to wear a mask. I don’t think anyone can take it seriously because they would want to do so.

73,42,I'm not interested in politics.

48,42,"What do you mean? That the government is trying to infect people with HIV that is not even a joke, doesn’t mean they won’t get vaccinated. They’re trying to get people to get vaccinated. This is a joke."
73,42,So a pedophile is not a pedophile?

73,42,"I'm not sure about the current situation with health care, but I would not want to hear the AMA. If you are being a bit ad hominem, then he needs to talk to your state's health care board.
