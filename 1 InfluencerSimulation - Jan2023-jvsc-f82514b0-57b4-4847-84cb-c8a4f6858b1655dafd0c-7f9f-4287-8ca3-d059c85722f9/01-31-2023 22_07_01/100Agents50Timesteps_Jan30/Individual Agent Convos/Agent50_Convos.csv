82,50,"I'm afraid I'm just being a little facetious here... I'm just a guy. I think the problem here is that the mask is an issue that isn't an issue or an issue, and a problem that has been spread across the country. There are people who don't like the word 'Mask', but they are not in a position to stop them from getting sick and becoming violent. It's not a question of a job and it's not a problem with a doctor who isn't in the position of"
95,50,"Well, one of the more prominent reasons he said that was because it's the only vaccine that gets you infected is because he likes to lick his teeth and shit and play football. Vaccination has a lot of positive side effects from that, which are not good."
50,11,"The vaccines that come out of the mouth are all about the people whose lives are endangered by the virus, which is part of the reason for the deaths of 200,000 people worldwide."
50,16,"""We need to have people wear masks - there will be many issues. We need to have an anti-virus vaccine if we really need to have a better anti-virus."
50,17,I was also told that the statewide mask mandate was not a joke.
50,20,My guess is that they're trying to make a new mask.
50,21,Weird. I never really wanted to learn about this.
50,24,"The people wearing the mask were just going to be jaded and think the government doesn't want to make them wear the mask, even if they should be ashamed of their identity."
50,25,A number of things have come to my mind:
50,29,"I'm a bit surprised to find that the other wiki article says a few people have been infected with HIV from something like this and if they wear a mask on their face when it's in a public place, it's also an important factor in preventing the spread of the disease."
50,43,A couple of years ago I read on the radio that the people in question are the most responsible for vaccines. A couple of years ago I read on the radio that the people in question are the most responsible for vaccines. The public is not the only one and they don't need to be vaccinated.
50,44,"You nailed it. But it was funny, and yes, it is hilarious."
50,46,"Yes, this is the point. The government is trying to create a vaccine to help prevent the spread of a virus."
55,50,'Hi - I wore a mask '
60,50,A lot of these comments are actually the wrong kind.
73,50,"... which is where people would like to go to look into what a ""Made in Texas"" policy is. I'm not sure that it can be legally done, but we can be careful that there isn't a ""Made in Texas"" policy. They are the ones that get caught in the act. There's nothing wrong with the ad."
75,50,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask in a pandemic because they'd never actually done it, but there's a reason that they shouldn't have to wear a mask for emergencies."
77,50,"The phrase ""folk masks"" can't be changed without getting a full-body mask. But its not just a gimmick and it is intended to help prevent spreading in the population. Vaccines are not a gimmick, and they are meant to help TB patients get a little safer."
81,50,"You mean ""he can be a child who thinks they're being a dick."""
82,50,"I’d say that “the doctor was asked for a mask” is pretty much the entire symptom of the virus, i.e. you didn’t go to the doctor to pick up the virus."
95,50,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People who make their own posts about vaccinating children to keep the word out of the internet are just being obnoxious and inflammatory.
50,11,"I've had a few days of bacterial skin infections in my family, so I don't wear any masks."
50,16,"You are not being unreasonable. This is the type of conversation I tend to see in the media. I'm going to say it again: 'The government and its citizenry are in the wrong.' I don't think they're going to get the right to make the public wear a mask, but you're wrong about the other stuff."
50,17,I like the way you think.
50,20,"So, the people who do something stupid are in trouble for wanting to help."
50,21,It's also a bit of a joke. It's pretty obvious there are a lot of people trying to explain what's going on here.
50,24,"It's not a mask mandate. It's a mandate that the government has no control over. It's not legal, but a moral compass of the government."
50,25,"They don't want to use it on kids. They want it to do them a favor and prevent them from becoming infected if they're infected. And they also want to help people, and people should be allowed to choose what they want. Is it only to protect them if they are infected and they're not? Or is it to give people a choice to not be infected?"
50,29,People have a right to not wear a mask and that should be a moral compass of the government.
50,43,In my head it would be pretty blatantly obvious if the CDC did something like that.
50,44,"This isn't about the government... this is about the person's health care system. If they want to try and prevent the spread of HIV, then they should definitely get a vaccine."
50,46,"If people don't wear a mask, the government would be forced to give the kids a different one."
55,50,I think it's funny and not even funny.
60,50,"Yes, if I had seen the film, I would eat it and break it off."
73,50,There isn't anything wrong with wearing a mask for a month or two.
75,50,What the other guy is saying is that the government isn't the one who has made this joke.
77,50,"I think it's good that it wasn't the whole ""Masks."" It's not about the people. It's about the people."
81,50,The first joke is...what?
82,50,"This has been a common discussion for years, including ""Wearing a mask would save lives."" In the end, I think that a mask will actually make things more serious."
95,50,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,11,It's also funny that the CDC is ignoring the fact that the vaccines are not to protect the people who infected themselves.
50,16,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,17,The issue isn't the government's. It's the government's policy that prevents the spread of HIV if there is something wrong.
50,20,They said that wearing a mask would save people from getting HIV.
50,21,"We've tried all sorts of things, including being able to keep a mask, but never got the health care."
50,24,"I believe the current ""Mask Mandate"" is a joke about the government trying to create a new anti-virus vaccine."
50,25,"As someone who is a bit of a neocon or anti-vaccine fanatic, there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask. It does, however, protect against many other diseases whose presence has gotten worse over the years."
50,29,Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again is a huge failure - but...
50,43,"If we're going to ban everyone from wearing a mask, we need to start having a law that screams ""An unfunny one with no hands"" and also the people need to put themselves into a coma and not use the word ""funny"" on their website."
50,44,"The government doesn't want to give people a choice, it wants to give people a choice."
50,46,">If people don't wear a mask, the government would be forced to give the kids a different one."
55,50,"I think the first two lines in that thread are really, really funny."
60,50,"He is a jerk, and a jerk. People say he's a jerk, and it's really funny how the government is so twisted and disingenuous."
73,50,"I'm just going to say that if the NSA was working with an ad in Texas to stop the spread of a virus, the laws in the state would have been in effect statewide."
75,50,What if people wear a mask at a party?
77,50,"I'm sorry this is a lot of fun, but I wouldn't say that it's bad. I think people should wear the same mask that is recommended. What are you talking about? Is it safe to wear a mask outside of your office?"
81,50,"You mean ""you mean ""he can be a child who thinks they are being a dick."""
82,50,"I think the most obvious problem with the word is it's use of the word'mallet'. It is a very common name for the virus. The NSA's job is to prevent the spread of the TB, especially those with TB. The NSA is a group of very powerful people."
95,50,"This is what we call the ""We're making a joke, but I don't get the whole point of the point. It's not a joke. But I don't get the whole point of the point."""
50,11,"You do realize that if people don't wear a mask and a helmet, the government should be forced to keep you and your family from being infected and not you."
50,16,"Unless the NSA and the government decide to ban people from wearing a mask, I think that's pretty much a joke."
50,17,"That's basically the only thing I get for having a joke. It's just a bad joke, and even if the guy wears a mask, the issue with me being the one who doesn't know what the joke is about is, that's just too damn funny. I don't see how the government could possibly make that joke, and it wouldn't hurt to have a joke about this. I don't understand that the government's policy is to prevent the spread of a virus. That's just stupid."
50,20,The NSA is a group of very powerful people. They are trying to stop the spread of HIV and its deadly diseases. They are trying to make the government do whatever it is they want with a mask to protect the people.
50,21,CANNOTANSWER is an irrational prick and a whack asshole.
50,24,I've never heard a joke before.
50,25,There is no good reason not to use it on kids. They don't need to use it on them. They need to wear a mask to protect them. There is no good reason not to use it on kids.
50,29,"The government is a fucking idiot, and the government does not want to work, and the idea that the government could do that is utterly ridiculous. If you have the money, and you have a budget, and a plan, you are in the wrong. If you don't have the money, you can't be part of the solution. It is not a problem that the government is trying to help, it is a problem that you will find a way to solve, and it is a problem that you don't have the resources to overcome. If you want"
50,43,"This is actually my favorite part of the whole post. I think we are all talking about the ""As someone who is a bit of a neocon or anti-vaccine fanatic, there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask."""

50,46,We need a mask. It's a good thing we do it. There's nothing wrong with it.
55,50,>Isn't it crazy that you see a guy bringing a mask to prevent a virus in the U.S.?
60,50,"You're probably the one who said ""a lot of these comments are actually the wrong kind.', ""You're being kind of jaded. I've never heard of the government that doesn't do that."""
73,50,[I don't think the NSA is a panacea for a vesicles infection. It is used as an escape and is not effective. I think the problem is that the NSA is redistributing aid to every single person in Texas.
75,50,"I think you're getting to the end of the whole thing, so I think I'll try to make the joke out of it."
77,50,The whole thing is about the government. They cannot enforce any of their laws. This isn't the joke. This isn't the joke. This is the joke.
81,50,I think the main point of a joke is that the CDC has a role in the spread of viruses.
82,50,"...but if a doctor were asked for a mask, what would they do? If the NSA has a job, they could just stop the CDC from being so aggressive with their'medical drugs' and just let him put a mask in his head?"
95,50,"I am not getting the joke... I think that the joke should be called ""we're making a joke. """
50,11,A funny joke here. There are not even enough jokes about vaccines in Texas to keep you from being infected.

50,20,That isn't exactly a joke. It is just that in some situations it is not really a joke.
50,21,"I'm really not sure if this is funny. My guess is they have something against the government to do. Basically, the government is just attempting to help the poor."

50,25,"[Did you know it's called a ""jail,""?"
50,29,We're making a joke because we like to fuck and laugh and tell jokes because we hate the NSA and their'medical drugs' and it's not an answer to the people we care about most.
50,43,Vaccination is necessary to protect children and the environment.
50,44,So what you are saying is that 'we're making a joke' means you need to wear a mask and a helmet to protect you and your family from being infected?
50,46,I don't even like the notion of saying that a mask is the solution to the problems that the government is trying to solve.

75,50,I think you could say the same thing. The AMA is a joke and everyone is being a dick. The government is not the one who made it.
77,50,"The problem with using a mask is that it can cause a brain tumor. They are only able to help people develop more fecal cells, so we don't have much control over them. They work very well."
81,50,"The word is ""Joke"" in the UK, because it's just a joke, and the joke is about how it affects the world. I think it's a good joke."
82,50,>Making a mask would save lives. It isn't a symptom of the virus. It is a medical issue. I’ve never seen any people being attacked by someone in a public place by the government.
95,50,"I see where the humor comes from, but the whole point is to let people know what the joke means. Because if you’re an adult and don’t want to talk about this stuff, you’re going to get your shit in your mouth, and the government is making them aware that they are being a joke. And you can’t just get up and say 'Wait, you gotta get vaccinated.' I feel like I’m being completely cheesy. I can’t do a joke like that."
50,11,It's called a 'joke' in the US but I've heard it more than once before.

50,20,This isn't even a joke.

50,24,I was just joking about how much government money we're spending to support people with a virus.
50,25,I don't have anything to say about it.
50,29,"""Making a mask and wearing a helmet for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again"

50,46,Vaccination is the only cure and the government has been trying to provide a symptom.

50,29,It's a joke.
50,43,This is the kind of thing that I see in so many posts:
50,44,I would think the article in question isn't a joke. It's a joke.
50,46,"The government is trying to become a joke, by not being willing to help people, by providing you a shield and trying to prevent them from getting sick, by preventing them from being vaccinated."

75,50,"The AMA is the joke, not the real one. The AMA is a joke, not a joke."
77,50,So what are you doing? I want to tell you that the whole thing is about a government agency. I think it is about a joke. I think the AMA is a joke. They are not about the people. They are not the government. They are about the people. They are not the government.

50,17,"Yes, the joke is about the government. There is a difference between a joke and a joke."
50,20,"I think the AMA is the joke, but a bunch of the things 'cannon sarcasm' gets the upper hand. They're being called a sarcasm, which is to say the general public likes to talk about their medical issues."
50,21,"So I just read it in the AMA, I'm going to say, ""I think this is a joke. I think this is a joke. I think it's a joke. 'The whole situation is a joke. It seems like the government is trying to become a joke, by not being willing to help people, by providing you a shield and trying to prevent them from dying and getting sick."
50,24,"The AMA is about government policy. It's a joke about what they are doing, which they're going to do. I think it's just going to be a joke. The joke is that the whole AMA is about the government. But that's it."
50,25,"AMA. ""The whole situation is a joke. It seems like the government is trying to become a joke. They are not just a government agency. They are about the people. They are not the government. They are not the government."""
50,29,"Yes, a mask is necessary, even if a child gets sick and a doctor gets sick if he doesn't wear it."
50,43,The US is still a joke and it would be a good place to start talking to people and to find a better way to get away from the people who are a bit intolerant.

50,25,"The AMA is an actual discussion between those who are not a doctor, the AMA is about the government."

50,46,"> in this case, the issue isn't the underlying joke, but the reason for this]."
55,50,People need to get their head off of the mask. They need to get off of the mask.
60,50,I'm so sorry AMAs and AMA's aren't related.
73,50,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""[I am] trying to find a way to help people in my community with the first one and the second one, I'm going ahead and say that they are getting a mask mandate."""
75,50,You have a hunch that I'm getting to the end of your story. What is the most valuable part?
77,50,I think the joke is probably about the government. It sounds like the public should be concerned about the AMA and not the government.
81,50,The movie is called 'The Red Cross'. It is about the government's actions.
82,50,"It’s very much a joke that the AMA is about. The AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the people who make them."
95,50,I've got an in depth background on vaccines in a wiki article.
50,11,"Are the AMA's about how the vaccines are being administered - if they are not, the AMA would be about whether it is really a joke about the government."
50,16,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
50,17,"I'd say the joke is a bit out of line, but it really is a joke. You’re wrong that there is no humor. You’re wrong. AMA:"
50,20,"AMA / AMA and AMA are separate, I'm not going to go through all the comments here."
50,21,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
50,24,"The joke is that ""We're trying to'make a fuck out of this' and the AMA is about the CDC trying to create a vaccine."" It's a joke about the CDC's failure to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
50,25,It's a joke because it's about the government. It's about the CDC's failure to prevent the spread of HIV.
50,29,"In any case, the AMA is about the government and the people who make it, not the government."
50,43,I'm just talking about some weird stuff that happens in the US and a lot of people in our country don't understand.
50,44,>I don't think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. I think a man who has been sick for 10 years should get a vaccine.
50,46,"It's like the first word in a resoundingly worded word, which isn't even a joke. And no one is willing to see it spelt this way because it implies the government's own failure. If you want to have an AMA, just type [your email address and email] (*reply to /r/cannothelp_) and you'll see that it's not a joke."
55,50,I believe the mask mandate is the problem.
60,50,I think the whole purpose of the AMA is to evoke a kind of empathy for people who would otherwise not be able to ascribe that sort of emotional resentment to someone who knows they are being a little crazy.
73,50,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
75,50,"CANNOTANSWER: As a person who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask during a pandemic, I'm very upset that you say you would not wear a mask to a party."
77,50,"The AMAs are meant to do nothing, but the government is not trying to get rid of this problem."
81,50,"The CDC is a joke about the government, and they are working to prevent the spread of the virus."
82,50,I have heard the same things.
95,50,What are you talking about? Vaccination isn't a joke because the vaccine isn't a joke because it's a combination of medication and therapy to help people from getting sick.
50,11,It's also funny that the CDC is ignoring the fact that the vaccines are not to protect the people who infected themselves.
50,16,"I think if a mask makes the public sick, then they should not wear one. If they are the ones that actually want it, then that might be the reason they don't want it."
50,17,"I know I've been at a few people’s parties - maybe a few, but it’s the AMA I was in with them (strangely) and that’s how I started."
50,20,It's a joke. The government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
50,21,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: The joke isn't a joke because it's the government's only action, but the government's failure to stop the spread of a virus."
50,24,">I believe the current ""Mask Mandate"" is a joke about the government trying to create a new anti-virus vaccine.'"
50,25,"""That’s not a joke."""
50,29,"if a guy is sick, he is not in a position to make any decisions. he does not want to be in an economic situation like this, he isn't looking to change his mind."
50,43,"In this particular case, the first part of your sentence says that a mask is the problem. It's a joke because it's about the government's failures. It's about the CDC's failures to prevent HIV."
50,44,">Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.',"
50,46,"I have not heard anyone mention that the government is trying to be funny by putting in a mask or helmet, but a man with a severe rash who is going to get vaccinated should probably get a helmet – because that's what they are trying to prevent."
55,50,"People that wear a mask to prevent HIV infection are more likely to contract HIV than the general population and are more likely to have HIV, so there is no doubt that's not a joke."
60,50,I think I may have read this because my mind is a little tainted by it. It doesn't look like a joke at all to me. I just know I am a doctor.
73,50,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
75,50,"""People with a severe rash are wearing a mask during a pandemic, and they need a mask that catches them off guard."""
77,50,Is the CDC trying to help the people?
81,50,"I don't know why you're saying this, but the joke makes me feel so awful."
82,50,"> ""The AMA is a joke. It isn't a joke. It's about how people perceive the government. It is about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. It’s about the government, the world’s population. It’s about the government, the world’s population."
95,50,Vaccination is not a joke.
