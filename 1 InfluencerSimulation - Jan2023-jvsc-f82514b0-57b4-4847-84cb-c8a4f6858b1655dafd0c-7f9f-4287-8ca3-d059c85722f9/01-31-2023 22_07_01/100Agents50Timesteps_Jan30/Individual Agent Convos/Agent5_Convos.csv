86,5,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again

9,5,My brother was in the orlando area. I was shocked to find out he did not have to wear a mask.
11,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
15,5,The new cdc rule says that people have no reason to get vaccinated if the disease is serious or persistent.
16,5,"My family was in the US from 1989 to 1997 and we are all in the same household. We have been in different locations but only for a few months so a new one is up. It isn't very easy, and even with a mask it may have been an inconvenience, and so we wore a mask every time we went to the zoo."
23,5,I'm pretty sure I've heard about the importance of vaccinating children.
47,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,5,"If you have no idea where to look, the only way to stop someone is to walk out, you need to go up to their parents house and bring them to the dentist."

69,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,5,In addition to how it makes you feel a little bit safer and safer in public.
79,5,The people who go out of their way to wear their masks are not the ones in need of help.
86,5,This is going to be one of the first things people start thinking about when they become vaccinated with the virus.
93,5,I don't think a face mask is good in this subreddit. I think it is the OP's version of the story
98,5,"I was also a big fat person. That's when you think about how you could go out and see how big you are, how big you are, how fat you are and how much you're in the room, how much you are talking about how fat you are and how small you are putting them. In other words, you don't get to wear your face off. You just can't see through your face and not even realize you're fat!"
5,3,"In that case a mask will stop it from spreading. If you really want to prevent someone from spreading, you should probably wear a mask. You should try putting a sack of samosas on their face. Or even a cloth to protect the skin in that area."
9,5,"That's right, but it's not a valid reason to have a mask at all."
11,5,"I'm afraid this isn't very clear. There are very strong groups of people who are willing to work with the government. It's not like a group of people are willing to do the 'right thing', but instead are going to just throw on an excuse to get sick."
15,5,"Yes, I believe it is a very vague thing."
16,5,> Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
23,5,"This is so true, and so scary. It makes me think it is the only reason that people wear a mask."
47,5,"I don't think this is very good. I would rather not go into detail about this, but I feel like it would be a pretty good idea for you to have a look."
51,5,I'm not sure if you get any of the other rebuttals you're coming up with.
55,5,I don't believe they have any protection at all. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,5,I thought I'd be the only one to get vaxxed. Thanks for your kind words.
75,5,"So in fact, the pandemic is in fact a pandemic. In my experience a pandemic is a shit pandemic if it happens again."
79,5,"The problem is that in order to keep people from getting caught with a virus, the government has to have a policy that people would be able to use their masks for the purpose of stopping the spread."
86,5,"What is going on here? Are we talking about bringing a shield? If it's used to protect you from virus spreading, it's still a mask you can wear outside. Taking a mask and wearing a mask outside will cause the virus to spread to everyone, so there will be no protection from those viruses."
93,5,"he was doing a LOT of things for the family to help with the ""suspects"" which was a lot of things for a lot of people to do. he's doing a LOT of people for him so that he can help himself."
98,5,I think the main difference is the mask that we wear that people wear. We wear it in public all the time because people don't like them and don't think it will ever be useful. I'm not sure why this guy doesn't just wear a mask but because he's a fat guy who doesn't actually like the idea of being fat.
5,3,I can't imagine what the problem would be without a sack of samosas.
9,5,"Well, my wife doesn't vaccinate. I don't vaccinate. She has to get out of it. I see that a good part of being safe is that we have to be vaccinated every day or something. That's ok, but I can't say how much safer I'm being to her. I mean, if she is vaccinated for a virus, I wouldn't care, but I'll just be wearing a mask outside."
11,5,"Unless there is some very strict government regulation that strays from this, it's not very clear. It's a state issue, but it's definitely not legal."
15,5,>I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke. I think he’s trying to use a mask as a joke
16,5,"So... this isn't about how a virus becomes a virus, it's about how that bug has spread in other parts of the US."
23,5,"Yes, there's an issue of the use of a mask."
47,5,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
51,5,"if the person's family is infected with the virus, they're also infected with a virus, so they're infected with that virus. I hope they're not all infected, but most of the people that get infected will be vaccinated."
55,5,"They are still saying that a ""masked mask is needed to stop the spread of a virus. In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
69,5,So you got vaxxed and you want to go on your next vacation and you want to take the CDC to your next stop?
75,5,People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
79,5,Are you an epidemiologist or a doctor?
86,5,"My grandfather has a mask, so they've had it in a long time. Whenever I took his mask to see him, he told me he was really putting on a mask to prevent me from being infected. I wore a mask to protect myself and my lungs. When I started kicking it, I started wearing it and he told me that I had to wear a mask, and not a mask."
93,5,It is the best excuse I can think of. What's the point in wearing a mask? That you feel like you're being taken advantage of and you think he isn't.
98,5,"I know right? This is a bit of a troll joke, and I can understand why people would wear them when they wore a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
5,3,He's putting a mask on his face to protect you against a pandemic.
9,5,"""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe please leep your mask on I hate wearing a mask. I don't even know what to do with it."
11,5,"If the US government is going to have to take a long time to change the constitution to stop the spread of the virus, and if there's no such regulation, it's not legally a bad idea."
15,5,"They were used to keep people from becoming infected, not to prevent people from getting the virus. The people who did the work did not go away."
16,5,"My husband and I grew up in Texas. We had a friend who had a flu. He told us all about it. He told us we needed to be vaccinated. We needed to be protected from the flu. We started wearing masks. We had to use masks, not just masks. It was a joke. He said that the flu spread everywhere. When he came back we started using masks, but after a while he started to go with a vaccinated friend. He was vaccinated with a mask, and the vaccina"
23,5,"I was gonna say something along the lines of ""I'm not the type of person who will stop a pandemic on a vaccinator."" That wasn't a joke, but ""I'm still wearing my mask."""
47,5,Is this the most effective means to stop the spread of a virus?
51,5,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated does not stop the spread of a virus.
55,5,"They are still saying that a ""masked mask is needed to stop the spread of a virus. In some states, we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."","
69,5,I don't know what the original was or what it says.
75,5,> People don’t want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
79,5,"I was told by someone who had a long discussion about wearing a mask (so long as you don't get sick, you can not have a virus unless you have a fetus), and a fetus that has been infected by that virus (and is not a symptom of HIV), and would need an antihistamine to get it. It is very interesting to me that when someone is in a position of authority they can put their foot down and refuse to go to the doctor because they don't want it to take this"
86,5,What is your favorite way to wear a mask?
93,5,"I think this post was probably meant to sound funny, but it's still a very popular joke."
98,5,"If you want to avoid this sort of joke and you want to avoid making one, you can."
5,3,The only thing that i understand about this is how people are blaming it on government for things like this. People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. Are you an epidemiologist or a doctor?
9,5,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe please leep your mask on I don't even know what to do with it. I think it's interesting how a doctor could get a little cig contaminated with the flu virus. Vaccines can be very effective. It's not a law in every country. Its a joke.
11,5,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, but it is a great topic and a great point to bring up."
15,5,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
16,5,I'm a medical student. I work for the US government.
23,5,I was vaccinated for a few months when I had a TB and had been vaccinated. It was the first time in a decade that I had seen that joke.
47,5,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You ARE a liar with a mouthful that says that people can not wear a mask, and the government can't enforce its laws if they don't want to do so. It is not illegal, and isn't required."
51,5,"Vaccines aren't just for adults. There are actually laws that allow people to be vaccinated by only wearing a mask while under a mask in public, including having them be sterilized. So the first time you wear a mask it makes your whole day."
55,5,I'm not sure I think it would be very interesting if someone wrote this about a guy who is bringing a mask to prevent a virus. He doesn't really need a mask to stop it. He just wants to try to get some new friends to put on a mask for him so he doesn't get a fucking headache. I think the NSA could be right - they don't need a mask to stop a virus.
69,5,"The CDC has a ""comments/8/department/vaccinated_frica/pubs/vaccin_frica_context.html](http://www.dccdc.gov/policy/restrict_events/pubs/policy/restrict_events/apk/commissions/pdc_public_vaccine_fricious_pre](http://www.dccdc.gov/policy/restrict_events/"
75,5,I'm not saying the government has a right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. We have the rights to be concerned about pandemics.
79,5,This is a problem I don't know what to think...
86,5,I like the feeling of being in a vaccinated state because it's a way to prevent TB. This could be the end result of the ad on r/amymedicalcomments.
93,5,"OP is the best version of this story. He is doing a lot of things for the family to help with the ""suspects"" which was a lot of things for a lot of people to do. He's doing a LOT of people for him so that he can help himself. He's doing a LOT of people for him so that he can help himself."
98,5,[([http://www.drhs.org/wba/drhs.htm)) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
5,3,You are not an epidemiologist.
9,5,I was just trying to be empathetic to someone else. What he was saying is that it makes you uncomfortable. It's a prank and it's not a joke. Is the CDC suing the CDC for not doing anything? I'm not a lawyer. It's just how it is.
11,5,Nope. Just a bunch of jokes. I've been in a lot of situations where wearing a mask on a job is a big deal.
15,5,"This is not the first time anyone has mentioned the CDC vaccination issue. They're talking about a really important issue of public health. It is about the protections against HIV. There's no reason why this would be a joke if it didn't even involve vaccinating. They're also concerned that if people were to be vaccinated they'd have an idea of what is going on in the world unless the virus was on their face. This has nothing to do with the US government, and it's a serious concern for them."
16,5,"Yes, it is a joke."
23,5,Vaccination is a medical requirement of the government. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. You can't get the right vaccine in the first place.
47,5,So the government has a job in a country and it isn't necessary to protect itself from a disease.
51,5,He doesn't like wearing a mask outside while vaccinated? The CIA is a criminal organization and the NSA has no authority to do anything about this. The CIA is trying to get a hold of us and not do anything about it. It is a threat to all of us and the government.
55,5,"If this isn't possible, you're right. The NSA isn't going to stop the spread of HIV in any kind of way."
69,5,>I'm pretty sure this is a joke.
75,5,"Well, the point is, people are shit. They're not in the best position to know if they're in the right for a pandemic to happen, but they should be able to make sure it doesn't happen again."
79,5,I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of in Texas. The CDC is an active part of the anti-hiv/mimicry movement.
86,5,In the comments I think they are implying that a CDC vaccine is a form of TB vaccine. I am just saying this.
93,5,"It was very important for me to say ""I think that it is the best excuse I can think of. What's the point in wearing a mask? That you feel like you're being taken advantage of and you think he isn't."""

9,5,It's just how it is. It's just how it is.
11,5,"So, I'm gonna just say if I'm going to wear a mask on a job, I'm going to wear a mask on a job? If not, a dummy mask wouldn't help."
15,5,"I can tell you that I'm not the president of the US, and the CIA is not the US government's government."
16,5,"Yes, it's a joke. It is a statement."

51,5,Vaccines are illegal and the NSA is trying to make it illegal.
55,5,"I've always wondered about the NSA's use of the term masked. My guess would be the government's use of masked masks to prevent infection. I would expect it to be an effective way to protect someone from the actual spread of the disease, but that is not the case."
69,5,"I have a friend who got vaxxed and told him he was sick and he was not on his way out the country. He's been with a family who was sick and was a doctor for about 20 years. I remember reading the newspaper that it was very funny that he was on the CDC website and he was asking what is wrong with his wife and child. I've met a lot of doctors who do things like that, too. It's crazy. People who don't even know about it are also pretty much all of the time."
75,5,"I can't even imagine wearing a mask because of a pandemic. It was meant to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke, but it's not like it's a joke."
79,5,"People in Texas have been wearing the ""Making Your Face Mask on"" sign ever since a recent CDC campaign to try and ban the use of a mask."
86,5,"...and yet, I think the CDC's efforts to try to prevent the spread of TB have been tainted. They haven't actually developed any vaccines to prevent it, they just continue to make them."
93,5,"It's called a ""old joke"" because ""it isn't funny."" I'm assuming you mean that your mom is in a funk, but that you don't feel like it?"
98,5,I would bet he's the person who makes this up. i don't think he's being a dick.
5,3,"Its like saying you don't want to get sick from pandemics or being sick by wearing a mask, but you think that the government is the government's government?"
9,5,"Isn’t a narcissistic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic, empathetic and empathetic person trying to defend themselves for wearing a mask, if they’re suing the CDC for not doing anything? It’s just how it is."
11,5,"Well, I just want to get my point across, but I am in fact very upset about something you said in the post."
15,5,"This is how it works. You aren't saying it's an illegal act, but you are saying that it is part of the vaccination measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
16,5,"In all fairness, this doesn't have to be a joke, it's a statement."
23,5,[Turn off the movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_spying/porn-porn) is a legitimate anti-virus advocate. It's one of the reasons why I've found that being a doctor without a mask to help the mother of an HIV victim is an important social service.
47,5,There are other health care programs available in the US.
51,5,This is a joke. It's not an answer to a question about the CDC. This is a joke.

Are you worried that it could spread the virus? Because if you are scared of the virus, you should know that they will be spreading the virus."

98,5,A few months ago a man had a phobia that had a lot of different meanings than it does now.
5,3,"Is there anything in the article he mentions that the CDC has nothing to do with the spread of HIV, and they have no mandate?"
9,5,"""Masked in a mask, it would be more painful to wear the mask"""
11,5,A friend told me about wearing a mask at parties when they were pregnant. It was fun and kept me warm because I couldn't stand them. When I first got out of the house I was dripping with shit. It was the worst feeling I've ever felt.
15,5,">He doesn't want to be a doctor. He knows that it's illegal, but they are very dangerous. The problem is people get sick in the form of a mask. They are trying to make people feel better."

47,5,"CDC is actually a government agency, not a private company. They work as a non-profit organization that provides HIV testing to people in need and if someone is sick enough to get tested, they will do whatever they can to help prevent that."
51,5,I don't understand the context - the guy is a joke and his position doesn't make sense to him.
55,5,"It's also a joke to say, ""Having a mask is a risk for a disease, but it's also a threat to people's health and the health of others."""
69,5,CDC doesn't want to bring in vaccines that aren't needed to stop people from getting HIV. There is a big amount of debate about why we are overreacting to people trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
75,5,"I think this is hilariously clever. My ex would say it was a joke about the fact that the AMA aimed to prevent a pandemic from recurring. My ex would also tell me he was being a liar and tried to give some people the illusion that a pandemic wasn't possible, and he was implying that it was the AMA to do so."
79,5,"""The problem is that in order to keep people from getting caught with a virus, the government has to have a policy that people would be able to use their masks for the purpose of stopping the spread.'"""
86,5,"ah, not good news, but I'm thinking about getting a mask."
93,5,I like the notion of using a movie to show that you are a human being and are not a zombie.
98,5,I can't even imagine being in a situation where a mask is actually something that makes people uncomfortable. Usually the most annoying joke is the one that isn't really about them and they don't make a point of how uncomfortable it is. If you wear it too much you get sick and get sick. I would say that masks are not inherently useful to stop a viral infection.
5,3,"I think it's a joke that makes sense. The CDC is a government agency, not a private company. They work as a non-profit organization that provides HIV testing to people in need and if someone is sick enough to get tested, they will do whatever they can to help prevent that."

79,5,"This is what a joke is... ""I'm a big fan of wearing my masks every day. Especially when my parents are trying to force me to wear them as a courtesy. I don't think it's something to be ashamed of because they are doing it."""
86,5,"Vaccines are for life, and in addition to that, they are for life."
93,5,The movie is hilarious and a joke.
98,5,"I don't really know anything about the real-life situation of people in the US, but I've lived around a few people with a phobia, i've heard of people who have been sick since childhood and have been on anti-virus vaccines, and they don't have a mask at all."
5,3,I think you need to talk to a doctor before you go.
9,5,"As a Canadian who never smoked any other flu, I found it hard to believe that there was a CDC article where the CDC cited a joke about the flu. I am sorry, but there is no actual proof that it's the vaccine."
11,5,You are absolutely right that this is a joke and that this is how people feel about this. It's like a joke.
15,5,That's a very nice joke.
16,5,">I just think this is a funny way to say it. I mean if you say that this post is misleading I don't think the article was true, it's probably a lie, but the link is just a fake."""
23,5,Vaccination is not a law. But they have the right to slander people for it. It's not a joke.
47,5,"We have a bunch of cases of the flu, you have to wear a mask to prevent your face from getting vaccinated."
51,5,he's really just not on their part. they're just not going to do anything about it
55,5,"I can't imagine someone who is trying to use the phrase ""masked"" in a joke to stop a viral infection."
69,5,I am surprised by this article.
75,5,"""People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.''"
79,5,A CDC mandate for wearing a mask will stop it from spreading.
86,5,"The whole AMA is a joke and people can't get a vaccinate, because it is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."
93,5,> It's a ripoff of the book.
98,5,I think the biggest problem with having a mask on is that it can cause you to look really fat. Whether you actually get sick from it or not is irrelevant.
5,3,[Pick the one that says you've been vaccinated in the AMA](https://www.cod.gov/research/comments/2012/07/08/Civic-vaccinated_flirt_flirt-genre-fira) I think you nailed it.
9,5,"I love the skepticism. I want to make sure that the government isn't putting out more and more jokes about the problem. I know it's going to be scary, but it's just something that's not going to work."
11,5,[The AMA that followed was a joke based on the fact that a large portion of people in the US are not even aware of the fact that an actual vaccine is being given.
15,5,"It's called a ""joke"" because of its ability to prevent viral spread. The CDC has a right to deny or not deny the need for the CDC to have vaccines to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. But I think they're trying to get rid of the idea of it. I can tell you that I'm not a lawyer, and they are not the government's government."
16,5,It was a joke - I don't get how people see this.
23,5,"Vaccination is not a law. Vaccination is a law, not a moral one. It's not a joke."

11,5,"I'm not a doctor, but when it comes to public health, the best thing for me is that I've never had to wear a mask, and if I had a public health appointment, I wouldn't wear a mask at all. I would just stay in a public restroom, just for that matter."

23,5,I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.
47,5,"In the U.S., they have a bunch of HIV cases. It's illegal, and isn't required."
51,5,"It's a joke. They are trying to make it illegal, and you aren't the only one that thinks this is a joke."
55,5,"This is just a joke. If we don't keep that to ourselves, it's a joke. If we don't get rid of this, it's a joke. I'm not really sure what it's about. I'm just making a joke."

86,5,"Vaccines aren't a joke. It's a joke. Vaccines aren't a joke. I don't know if they're a joke, but a joke? I know a joke? That's a gimmick."
93,5,I've read a LOT of the book as well as many other things that could have been a ripoff of it. And the 'old joke' was an attempt to be funny a little bit.
98,5,"If I want to avoid this sort of joke and I want to avoid making one, I can."
5,3,I think the article he quotes is a bit misleading as it's an attempt at getting a sense of humor that's aimed at people not having to wear a mask.

15,5,Is it possible you were able to say he was trying to be funny?
16,5,Is there a joke that isn't really true?
23,5,I read the same thing. I read that it was a joke about the CDC doing a “medical mandate” to help stop the spread of the disease. A lot of the jokes are in a book.
47,5,The AMA is about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,5,"I have to say, I think it's funny and doesn't make sense."
55,5,A lot of the people in the sub can agree that this is a joke.
69,5,I'd go to a therapist and talk about it and I'm not going to go to the CDC because I can't fuck people up.
75,5,"The whole point is that a doctor slammed the anti AIDS and the government. The government is ineffective at trying to stop the spread of pandemics, and has made it a symptom for pandemics. The government is not. But it has to do with pandemics."
79,5,I feel like I'm the one that's putting the issue in front of me. Is there any difference between the CDC and the state gov't?
86,5,"If you are the only person in the world to have a viral virus, your chances of having it are high. The CDC, or your own organization, is an incompetent, twat."
93,5,...and he did a really good job at putting you at the bottom of a pile of comments on the book. You're really trying to make a joke about this.

5,3,"What's the joke? Why don't you try the AMA. If you want to prevent someone from spreading, you should take some extra precautions to protect yourself before you go. It's not that they don't have any responsibility for the spread of the disease, but rather that they are suing a government for not doing it."
9,5,It's interesting how a doctor could get a little cig contaminated with the flu virus.
11,5,This is a fucking joke - you are going to be a fucking doctor with a mask.
15,5,"A friend of mine got a fecal virus from her mother. She wanted to get the vaccinations because her mother felt like she had just done it, and she thought it was a joke. She told the other person, ""If you want to be a doctor, you should get one.""

75,5,"This is a joke. It's a joke. It's not about the government. It's about the government. It's about the people who are making jokes about the government, not the pandemics."
79,5,Why the fuck does the CDC have to ban the use of the mask?
86,5,"I can't tell if there is a joke about this or not, but if it's a joke about the CDC, they're just trying to get the word out."
93,5,I listened to the book last night. Its a fun read but I'd still take it off. I read a bit but it's still a rip off.
98,5,"As someone who is in the same situation, I'd say that's what's needed in this case. Having a facial expression in the same position as a face or a hand is not a joke because the idea of being fat isn't an actual thing."

15,5,The CDC is using people's body parts to be a disguise to protect the public from the spread of HIV. The public can't just be vaccinated. They just use their bodies as masks to help protect public health. You should read the AMA before you try to read it.

23,5,"They are telling an issue. The issue is not that people are going to stop HIV spread, it's that people are going to continue to do it."

51,5,"I know that a lot of people in the comments were referring to the article and this post, but I have to give the other people the same treatment."
55,5,I'm being serious. I think that's the best way to say it.
69,5,It seems like everyone in this sub is being petty and naive and it's one of those things where you can't see people on TV. The point is that people should be able to do what they want. It's not a joke.
75,5,It's a joke.
79,5,"Yes, I like wearing a mask."
86,5,"I was going to say, ""Vaccines are for life, and in addition to that, they are for life."
93,5,OP is the best version of the story.
98,5,"There are people wearing masks, and I know people who wear them. If they don't use one, they'll just give up and have the same thing."
5,3,There is a very clear argument that I’m wrong: “The CDC is using people’s body parts to be a disguise to protect the public from the spread of HIV.
9,5,"Vaccines aren't legal. They are for life, not just to help with the disease."
11,5,Those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion.

47,5,"CANNOTANSWER: 'We have a bunch of cases of the flu, you have to wear a mask to prevent your face from getting vaccinated.'"
51,5,"This is what I think is a pretty dumb joke, I'm not saying it makes sense. I'm saying that the CDC is basically promoting a government vaccination program that is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
55,5,"I'm pretty sure we should be asking why people should wear masks as a joke – not because of the NSA's failure to stop it, but because of the way masked men used to use it and when they were on it, it seemed to be a real joke – like the guy with the mask."

93,5,That's not how you read the whole book.

5,3,"The joke makes sense. If you want to protect yourself against the spread of HIV, you have to wear a mask."
9,5,I think it's interesting that they want to get rid of the CDC. It's because of what it is saying.
11,5,"The most important part of a joke is not a joke, it's a joke."
15,5,I don't think this is an actual joke.
16,5,"I just read the title and felt I was the only one to find this humorous. The AMA is a joke. Honestly, I wouldn't even be the first person to comment on a joke about a doctor taking off their mask, even though they're still doing it, they're doing it for the sake of avoiding the problem."
23,5,"It's really ridiculous that you're so used to these kinds of jokes in your own life. They can be so funny, and can be a terrible joke, and just not to the point where it's not even real."

69,5,"""But the joke is in the movie. We are all sick, and all have their fears."
75,5,This is an interesting topic. It's very atypical of people who make jokes about the government in order to help people who aren't vaccinated.

86,5,A lot of people are a joke about the AMA. They're based off an AMA.
93,5,"It’s a rip off because it’s based on a book, but this one makes no sense. You’re fucking crazy for not reading it. You’re crazy for not listening to the book because it’s a book."
98,5,"There are plenty of people that have their phobias in common. But in your experience, they don't have a good idea what it is they just think they have the right thing to do. It's like being a guy who has a dick, not having a problem with being in a situation where it makes you look sick, and that's not a joke. Generally, the joke is what a friend of mine told me when he asked if he could use a mask to stop the spread."
5,3,You are essentially making this joke.
9,5,"I don't understand how this article might not have been very relevant in a 'Still, he doesn't think a CDC doctor would ever think of the flu as a joke. But it does! That's how this AMA should be made. Whether he would have made this joke or not is pretty much up to the CDC to decide whether it is relevant for him."
11,5,A mask for work. I am going to get my kids to wear one.
15,5,"I'm not a doctor, but I have a few more questions."
16,5,A good joke. A good joke. A joke. A good joke.
23,5,"CANNOTANSWER: Vaccination is a medical requirement of the US government. You can't get the right vaccine in the first place."", ""The government has the right to slander people for it."", """
47,5,"In fact, it's the most important one."
51,5,The CDC has no authority to make this illegal. It is also illegal for people to do whatever they want.
55,5,"... I've never heard of someone using the term ""masked a person's tshirt,"" which sounds like a very silly joke if you ask me."
69,5,"It is actually a joke, which is probably why most people are upset and angry with the government. But you do know the joke isn't funny, but it is a joke."
75,5,This is the last thing I want to do at all if I are going to ask the government not to tell me what to do in a pandemic.
79,5,"""I wear my mask because I am nervous about getting infected."
86,5,It's a joke. The article is about the AMA. The article is based off an AMA. The article is based off an AMA.
93,5,"""I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day. I could imagine a movie that made you laugh as though you were on the train. I'm just gonna add that it's not funny at all. The movie is a ripoff of the book. The whole joke is a ripoff of the book. It's one of the many reasons that it's a ripoff of the"
98,5,>The first remark in my mind is just a joke.
5,3,I think this is a good joke.
9,5,"I don't think there's anything relevant about this. I think it's a joke that's meant to be a joke. If it's a joke, it's a joke."
11,5,"...it's a joke, it's a joke. The author makes a joke about a CDC mandate, and this isn't a joke about an actual vaccine."
15,5,"I am not a doctor, but I think the most important thing we've got to stop spreading is the AIDS epidemic, because everyone who has been exposed to it is probably not a physician. We don't need to vaccinate everyone for a long time, just to save our health."
16,5,So here is a gist of what people thought of the movie:
23,5,"In a very unpopular opinion, the government has a duty to provide care for people with HIV or any other disease or other health affecting condition. The AMA was a legitimate attempt to make fun of the government. There's a reason that if the government does not comply, it's going to fail because it's not relevant."
47,5,non no
51,5,Vaccines aren't legal because they protect against any type of disease. They aren't legally required unless you're a doctor. Vaccines aren't legally required for many diseases.
55,5,"I like the NSA's attempts to stop and stop HIV, but they are a bit too quick to change the ts."
69,5,[The post isn't about what the article is about. It's about the fact that CDC is essentially trying to make people resentful because the government is trying to make people resentful. The government is trying to make people resentful because they have been sick for years and do everything they can to make them resentful. The government is trying to make people resentful because of how many people are scared about it and what not.
75,5,CANNOTANSWER:
79,5,"The whole issue is what a joke is... ""I feel like I'm the one that's putting the issue in front of me. Is there any difference between the CDC and the state gov't?"", ""...I feel like I'm the one that's putting the issue in front of me."
86,5,"It's a joke, not a joke. It's a joke."
93,5,The whole joke is a rip off of the book.
98,5,"OP, this is a bit of an idiom. I am not sure why someone would ever wear a mask. It's a joke and a bit of a troll joke."
5,3,"No matter what he did, it was a great joke. It's a good joke."
9,5,CANNOTANSWER is a very strong voice for the anti-mischief movement.
11,5,"Nope, I'm being pretty adamant that the most important part of a joke is not a joke."
15,5,I don't know how to respond to the AMA without being a little cynical and sarcastic.
16,5,I had a doctor who put off his mask for a while because he thought it would be funny but got sick and was forced to get the medicine for the flu?
23,5,"Vaccination is a mandate of the US government. You can't get the right vaccine in the first place."""
47,5,"If you're a little off topic, you're allowed to cite anything that is not lawful for you, such as a medical certificate or any other medical device you think would be necessary to stop a virus from spread."
51,5,>He doesn't like wearing a mask outside while vaccinated? The CIA is a criminal organization and the NSA has no authority to do anything about it.
55,5,"It's a joke, it's not a joke, it's a joke."
69,5,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,5,"I'm not sure what this means - the fact that I'm being asked to come to the AMA shows that it's not about a government or the government but a'man who has been sick for 10 years' that it's a joke. It's also that the article says AMA is about prevention and prevention, not vaccinations. It's about protecting the public and protecting the public."
79,5,"And this was the article where he said that the CDC pushed for the CDC to ban the use of the ""Making your Face Mask on"" sign based on ""We have a public health system with this very same thing. In that article, he says that while the CDC has no incentive to keep you in the hospital, you're not going to stay with them when they try and scare you out of an infection."", ""...I think it's a joke because the CDC has to have a policy that people would be able to wear."
86,5,"I'm just saying that the people who are being lied to are a joke. Not a joke. Just a joke. But I'd apologise for the ""jake"" that was made of this."
93,5,RIP of the book - you rip off the book and everyone else rips off it
98,5,"It's just the first remark I made. I mean, I love a good joke. But i hate it.'' I don't think that would be a joke if i did. But if I don't like it then I would probably say that it's a joke."
5,3,"As a physician, I can say with confidence that if you want to get a vaccine for someone you should get one of the vaccines. I can say that the same for many people, but I'd say the same thing about the vaccine:"
9,5,CANNOTANSWER is a very strong voice for the anti-mischief movement.
11,5,"Are you interested in learning about the ""The Doctor Who AMA"" and what the AMA AMA is about?"
15,5,A CDC article about the AIDS vaccine.
16,5,It is one of the great American political and social lessons learned from the AMA and is the basis of a lot of things.
23,5,And the AMA was about the CDC doing a “medical mandate” to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. A lot of people in Texas are sick. The CDC has been on the frontline for several years. You get sick when you have a good doctor. I don't see how it could be considered a joke.
47,5,"This is not the same as the AMA that the author is referring to. The AMA is about government, CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
51,5,"I had a man I had met who did not like wearing a mask outside for his birthday, and I never noticed him until he got tested in December. He had a cold and was not going to see a doctor for 4 weeks without a blood test because he was in an intensive care unit with AIDS. That sucks."
55,5,The CDC has a lot of issues. That would lead to a lot of bogus arguments here.
69,5,I think the joke about that is the joke of the joke.
75,5,No. A lot of people are making jokes about the government in order to prevent pandemics. People are able to ignore the facts and use the actual facts as evidence of their failure to do so.
79,5,"Using the phrase ""masked faces"" as a way to prevent the spread of a virus is like asking why people would not wear a mask?"
86,5,The AMA is a joke about the CDC. They haven't developed any vaccines to prevent TB. They just continue to make them. It is about what the AMA is about.
93,5,"This post was meant to be funny, but it's still a popular joke."
98,5,I think a lot of people are referring to the concept of wearing a mask and saying that the person is a person whose phobias are a joke.
5,3,The issue isn't about a certain reason. It is about the way the CDC treats people. It's about being an official entity and being able to do so. It's about protecting public health and the public at large.
9,5,"I agree with your interpretation. This isn't a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
11,5,AMAs are not a joke.
15,5,I like the idea of putting an AMA on a patient's face to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. There is no way it can stop the spread of HIV. The problem is people get sick in the form of a mask. They just use their bodies as masks to protect the public from the spread of HIV/AIDS.
16,5,"CANNOTANSWER, MD, was actually referred to in an interview as a pedophile in an AMA about the government, which he said was an AMA."
23,5,"The AMA was made to promote a joke about people infecting others with HIV. The AMA and its propaganda are a pretty interesting idea, and the AMA is about the president making a joke about a public health issue, and his joke about a government slander is pretty funny. The AMA and his propaganda are really good, and you'd think he would have done better, given that the movie was about a pedophile putting his hands on the virus, and the AMA is just about a joke. I've read the article."
47,5,It isn't about the government. The AMA is about the CDC and the world's population.
51,5,I know you're trying to avoid saying that you're a sexist and a racist because your own beliefs suck. The CDC is trying to change that. I know it's a joke.
55,5,"It's an awful joke, but a real joke. It doesn't sound that much like a rip off of a book."
69,5,"No one is going to listen to the comments, I just felt like a kid and couldn't understand what the article was. This kind of behavior could be a dick move to the CDC and you have no idea how they were putting the public health system at risk. It's a ripoff of a book."
75,5,"This is an interesting topic, and I'm an extremely educated individual."
79,5,The government has no incentive to keep you in the hospital. It's not a joke.
86,5,"AMA isn't about how people have TB. It's about a joke. I don't think you need to be a doctor to make a joke. But the article is about how people are being lied to, and it's about what the AMA is about."
93,5,It sounds like you are the one who fucked up.
98,5,"I'd be quite surprised if a large number of people who wear masks are going to come to the table and think: ""Hey, I thought you mentioned that one too. I think you're very well versed in this and it's probably very good you would put on a mask, so I'm a bit embarrassed if I'm not."
5,3,This is an interesting point. This isn't about the issue.
9,5,"( Isn't a'serious skepticism. I'm just trying to make sure that the CDC doesn't make a bunch of these sexist jokes. '' Isn't a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke. ''I think this isn't a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's just how it is.""'' (In this thread)"
11,5,"“I think the point of the AMA is that people who are trying to 'keep people alive' are in trouble for wanting to help. If a doctor doesn't want you to wear a mask, they aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. If you’re a doctor, they aren’t interested in the fact that you are sick. They aren’t interested in the fact that you are sick"
15,5,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: It's pretty funny that a lot of people say he doesn't have an idea what it actually is."
16,5,That's what I learned from my work.
23,5,the AMA is about a joke about a government issue.
47,5,You have a job. You have a job. You have an office.
51,5,"""This is a joke."""
55,5,I don't think the NSA has any protection at all. I think it's the people with the mask who are able to prevent HIV. They are trying to stop it.
69,5,Is there any chance that there would be a joke? Like how you're going to get all those sick kids who're afraid to go to the CDC for a sicker person?
75,5,AMA. What do you mean?
79,5,"I think there is a clear lack of understanding on how the government operates to stop this sort of thing, and how it should be perceived."
86,5,">We're pretty much a joke about a guy who gets sick with an AMA about the government helping with TB."""
93,5,"I was the best friend of my friend who read The Phantom Menace on the train and they're really weird for putting it on, but this makes me think of some interesting movies and stuff I've been in."
98,5,"I wear masks all the time in public because I hate them and because I feel I'm 'too fat' to be able to go out without a mask because I do not like it, and the one thing I do that makes me uncomfortable is I think 'I'm not sure if it's just a joke', but I like it because it's funny. It's basically just a joke. It's just a joke, but it's useless and I hate it."
5,3,i have no idea how to spell this out and I am so empathetic.
9,5,"It's a joke. They don't want to make it illegal, they don't want to make it illegal."
11,5,"I was wondering why ad man and a mask would be the same thing. I said something like ""A lot of people wear masks when they're sick."" Then I read the first line and remembered this:"
15,5,"The CDC is trying to get rid of the idea of a ""joke"" in terms of the prevention of infection in our country. It's not the first time anyone has mentioned the CDC vaccination issue."
16,5,"""I'm not even trying to be sarcastic, but that’s a joke. It’s a joke. I have to disagree with you and your comment. It's a ripoff of the book, and a ripoff of the book."""
23,5,"I don't think anyone in this thread has ever seen the AMA about what the AMA is about. I don't think it's anything close to what it is, just that people like the people presenting it a little different in every way."
47,5,"It's not about government, but about what is happening in other countries as well."
51,5,Vaccines are legal and the NSA is trying to make it illegal.
55,5,It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke. A joke that is intended to stop the spread of a virus.
69,5,"This is the stuff where I'm not a really good doctor, but where I know people who are. I know many people who want to talk about HIV but are afraid of being sick and don't know what it is about. I know a lot of people who don't know what it is about. The CDC is trying to make people resentful and the joke is silly but not funny at all."
75,5,"The joke is about government. If it's about the US or the CDC, it is about preventing the spread of the pandemic."
79,5,"It's a joke and I do not want to use it as an excuse, it's a joke."
86,5,"There's a really nifty article about how to prevent a common viral infection through a vaccine. If you're sick and the government helps in protecting you you're not infected. Unless you want to know what the AMA is about, you shouldn't care."
93,5,"i love reading books, but i feel the author is trying to play into the myth that he's using a movie to show that people are being taken advantage of.

16,5,"I don't know what else you're thinking, but a very simple statement."
23,5,Yes. This is a joke.
47,5,"The AMA is about government, CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
51,5,"The CDC isn't just making jokes about the CDC, but about the 'taylor johnson' and the CIA being the ""good guys"" trying to make the government do whatever they want."

93,5,">I read a bit, but I still wear a mask every day. I could imagine a movie that made me think of some interesting movies and stuff I've been in."
98,5,"The biggest joke to be made is a joke about the CDC threatening to kill people with HIV. I've been told a lot about them, but if they don't know what they're talking about, they'll just give up and have the same thing."
5,3,"So I'm gonna go with a bit of the ""The CDC has no obligation to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself."" joke."
9,5,It's a joke about what it is.
11,5,You mean I'm an expert on public health?
15,5,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: A lot of people say that the CDC is taking this so far without being a joke. It is pretty funny that a lot of people say he doesn't have an idea what it actually is. They are trying to prevent the spread of HIV. They are trying to make people feel better."
16,5,"I'm afraid I just read the title. I was wondering, ""A good joke"" and did not get the context that the original quote was based off."

93,5,"I have read a lot of the book. Honestly, the most popular version of this story is ""The Doctor in the Hat"". It was written by a man who had never read it.
