79,73,as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
82,73,please help by following the order so we can remain open and safe for everyone whether you agree with the mask or not we need to follow the order and please be kind to the staff if they remind you they are just trying to do their job thank you all for your understanding
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,7,"OP, you know how the federal government works, you should go suck at it."
73,11,"I don't agree with that position at all. i'm from texas and i don't think they will follow the law, but I think they will and this is a good example of how government is being too harsh."
73,13,I was there and got up with a lot of people.
73,14,We must change our constitution to stop the spreading of the virus.
73,16,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."

73,29,... and they are a bit of a prick and a bit of a fraud.
73,31,A federal mask mandate should protect your rights and make you a person in the world.
73,33,I don't even understand what you mean if you read the title you aren't going to follow it unless you follow the OP's directions. I do know that this is an old ad. I don't see the whole thing as a problem at all unless you follow a different article OP's comment has for you.
73,34,... you are a fucking pedophile.
73,37,They say that they want to see him without his mask.
73,38,i am a federal agent and i have a state employee's license and it is my job to help people with my personal problems
73,40,It's just as bad if people have to take steps to keep the federal government from introducing a new one.
73,42,He cut education funding. You could say this is a conspiracy to prevent the spread of the virus.
73,47,The people of texas would do a good job with the mask if it were an effective mask.
73,50,"It doesn't even sound right to me that he is trying to enforce a statewide mask mandate, but he is doing it. I am pretty sure that it would be a better way to deal with the problems associated with a statewide mask mandate if the state passed it."
73,52,I am going to try to tell you the truth about how my state isn't on this list. We should go. We should also be able to be as good of a voter as possible.
73,54,"... And a statewide mask mandate would be the most important piece of legislation ever. It is a very valid and enforceable part of the legislation in the state of California, and the statewide mask mandate will be the most important part of it."
73,56,So you think wearing a mask will stop the spread of the virus?
73,65,>I like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask
79,73,"As someone who lives in a conservative county in California, what does that mean to you?"
82,73,We can develop a mask to protect us from corona. It would save lives.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,Then you should consider going to the state statewide mask mandate to stop the spread of the virus.
73,7,Is this a statewide mask mandate? Because there isn't an effective one.
73,11,>We must change our constitution to stop the spreading of the virus.
73,13,It's not as if he's trying to be a pedophile or a con artist or a pedophile. He's just trying to try and elicit someone who thinks he can do better than him.
73,14,He lied and made a troll post about it on r/legaladvice.
73,16,It's a legitimate reason to not vote for a statewide mask mandate.
73,27,I like the part about what the other commenters are saying.
73,29,"Nope, this is more like a liar, if the nba tried to take him to a medical center, we'd be having to go to a surgeon. The people of California don't want to take them, they want to take care of the child that snuck into the world."
73,31,"if there was a statewide mask mandate in California, they wouldn't have to apply for an individual person to wear it"
73,33,... and they are a bit of a prick and a bit of a fraud. A federal mask mandate should protect your rights and make you a person in the world.
73,34,"So I'm gonna ask you, what does that mean to you?"
73,37,... you are a fucking pedophile. They say that they want to see him without his mask.
73,38,"I know what you mean, but you're a pedophile and he would not have done it if he did that."
73,40,"Yes, it is illegal for the state to implement the Statewide Mask mandate if it isn't a statewide mandate, which is a federal one."
73,42,"There was a good ad recently called ""God I love you and don't let me hurt you"" (which I still am). I read it and thought, ""Oh, I love you but you don't like me"" but I thought ""I love you so much."" And then I read it again. It just came out this morning."
73,47,"They're bringing up a really stupid issue. The state of Texas is trying to stop the spread of a virus. We haven't actually tried anything to stop it, but we've got something in mind."
73,50,"I think a federal mask mandate is a bit of a misstep, but it's also not a good idea, since it only affects those armed guards who have no real protection from the federal government."
73,52,"It is a very valid and enforceable part of the legislation in the state of California, and the statewide mask mandate would be the most important piece of legislation ever."
73,54,The state is bringing a new policy. I am not going to be the first person to say that.
73,56,"I think that this was just an ad with a lot of references to the president and the governor, so maybe a little too much of a bit of a prick if you want a better way to read it."
73,65,"""Wood - what did I do wrong, sir?"""
79,73,They need to bring in people in order to get the drive up test. In the UK we've got a public health system with this very same thing.
82,73,I am surprised that they haven't changed it in over a decade. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks. I'm so glad that the gov't has stepped up to help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

73,6,"I really hope he gets a job. It's nice to know that he's a real dad, and I just can't imagine that doing this right now would be as nice as someone wanting to be."
73,7,This is a great one. They must be really proud that you've never done this. It was such a big mistake to write your own story about it in the first place.
73,11,The government isn't going to change anything about the health care system or the state. This is a big issue.
73,13,"This is probably why it's so easy to say ""it doesn't matter what I do for the public health. I can do it for people in the world and I will not take anyone else in the world to do it."""

73,31,They want to take him to a medical center. A federal mask mandate shouldn't have to do it.

73,38,"This is a real problem. You know, in Texas. This is the only problem."
73,40,"I'm not going to change my life... I love the guy, but I don't have to. The way he talks about the federal government is just so bad, and I don't want to be the one who is the one who takes advantage of us."
73,42,[He had a statewide mask mandate.](http://www.nba.org/wp/wp/health/sah-govt-mask-mandate).
73,47,It's a really stupid issue. The state of Texas is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
73,50,I'm gonna go ahead and say that they are getting a mask mandate.
73,52,... the State is bringing a new policy. The state is bringing a new policy.
73,54,">They say that they want to see him without his mask. I know what you mean, but I'm a pedophile. They say that they want to see him without his mask."
73,56,A federal mask mandate would be a good idea.
73,65,a federal mask mandate is a misstep.
79,73,It's very easy to get caught with HIV.
82,73,">Hey, I'm trying to find a way to help people in my community with the first one and the second one, I'm going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. They're saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it."
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"OP, you are correct that the law in Texas is against making your child a protected child."
73,7,"You're a kid, right?"
73,11,"That's what the big issue is. You like the guy, but you don't want to change your life. You don't want to change your life."
73,13,"In California, the government is responsible for the spread of HIV. He had a statewide mask mandate. The state is bringing a new policy. It's a really stupid issue."
73,14,"I was born in the US but we were in Texas and it was still very scary to me at the time. We had to have a statewide mask mandate, but we would be able to have him go to the hospital and then we could go and do some shit there."
73,16,It's very easy to get caught with HIV.
73,27,This is why I am here. I just need to take a break from it and fuck myself.
73,29,"It's not that he doesn't need a mask, it's that they are not allowing him to wear a mask - he's only getting the health care and other services he needs in the city. So he might as well take a federal mask and let them do it for him? Or maybe he's having more problems at the hospital now that they do it?"
73,31,He was a pedophile and would not have done it if he did that. I am still a little upset about that.
73,33,What does this say about his state? The federal mask mandate doesn't actually protect the rights of people who are caught with HIV.
73,34,"I can't help myself but hate it. I'm a very sensitive person, and I'm not a big fan of the government. But I don't care how they talk about the virus, I care about the health and safety of my own health. It's really not what they should be doing."
73,37,"The guy was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown. But I understand that the statewide mask mandate doesn't apply here in Texas. They're making it so that the government cannot infringe on their pedophilia."
73,38,"In fact, there is a real problem. A statewide mask mandate. You can see a boy on a plane without a mask, and if you're not wearing a mask, you're not a pedophile."
73,40,I just read something about this on the wiki page and I know that it was a good idea to do so.
73,42,Why are you getting upvoted?
73,47,"In his defense, he is absolutely right and it's a misstep that he is trying to do in Texas."

73,56,I don't even know how a guy can say that.
73,65,Well he was still a pedophile so you have to take him to a medical center.

73,6,"a mask is something the government doesn't have to enforce. A statewide mask mandate is a way to stop people from getting caught with HIV. The government is ignoring that the problem, and its a good idea."
73,7,"It's a huge mistake to make, but it's a huge step towards keeping HIV patients safe. The government doesn't want to let HIV patients be on the plane without a mask, so you're getting an extremely difficult time."
73,11,This guy is a man. He is a dangerous person. I don't understand how he is claiming to have a statewide mask mandate.
73,13,There's a lot going on.
73,14,"If he wasn't a pedophile, then yes, a federal mask mandate would not actually protect against HIV. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US."
73,16,The problem in Texas is that there's no way to fuck out a federal mask mandate. A federal mask mandate does not prevent the spread of a virus.
73,27,"In the US, the government does not have a mandate that addresses the spread of HIV."
73,29,"he's not a pedophile. he was not a pedophile, he was a drug addict."
73,31,"Yeah, the guy was a pedophile and would not have done it if he did that. He was a pedophile and wouldn't have done it if he did that."

73,38,"""I can't understand why it's a real problem. You know, in Texas. This is the only problem."""
73,40,If the statewide mask mandate doesn't apply here in Texas it means the federal government isn't allowed to use that to stop the spread of a virus and this isn't an illegal option.
73,42,"Is that the same guy that was on a plane without a mask for at least a month after he got caught? It would be something that I can see the guy with and not just the pedophilia, I can see a man without a mask."
73,47,"I don't see how you could be trying to help a guy's mother. I can understand why she's in a lot of pain but is still a pedophile, so I'm sure she doesn't want to get a mask on her body. She's very fucking selfish."
73,50,The fact that the people in his city are on his watch list and that is why they need to abide by the law is beyond me.
73,52,"The ""Made in Texas"" policy."
73,54,This is the wrong place. The government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV in the US.
73,56,You're just being a dick. We're not here to tell the truth.
73,65,Is wearing a mask in this post a problem of 'government incompetence' in Texas? I think I'll give a couple of examples.
79,73,"I don't think I've ever understood why people can't put a mask on, especially in Texas. If they are on a daily basis and I'm not sick, I think a mask isn't a good idea."
82,73,"The mask isn't a health issue, the fecal vaccine is."
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,It's not even an illegal option here. This is not the pedophile thing.
73,7,"I read this as ""I think the federal government should go suck at it."" (This is probably the best explanation for why he doesn't want to get a mask."
73,11,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Is wearing a mask in this post a problem of 'government incompetence' in Texas?
73,13,It doesn't seem like he's trying to go through this to get his slap on the wrist. He's trying to get a federal mask that's not going to do much.
73,14,And he's not saying he wants to stop this?
73,16,This is not my favorite post in the thread. This is the top comment.
73,27,This guy is on a plane without a mask?
73,29,"""Is wearing a mask in this post a problem of 'government incompetence' in Texas?"
73,31,"Having a mask isn't a good idea, just a part of the government redistributing aid in the face of an HIV outbreak. Regardless, that's not a good idea."
73,33,"You are an idiot. Why wouldn't a man with HIV get a mask and not be sick and don't put a mask on? What do you want to do for a living? If I were the person that did that, I'd say I'd be fine with that."

73,50,"People who aren't aware that a mask doesn't help spread HIV can only be a problem in a community without the protection of the federal government. They are being lied to, as the government says in this case. The issue is more with the federal government than its own citizens."

101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"I'm sure that the guy in this thread can see this, and agree with everyone else. I would also go to an abortion shelter and ask for their help in finding out if anyone is trying to work in Texas."
73,7,It's just a federal mandate. They have no right to put HIV patients on planes without a mask. They just want to keep the health of their fellow citizens safe. This is a problem that has not been addressed in the public eye.
73,11,"It is important to note that I did not see that one of the federal mandates that he put on was in place. I know you do not read it, but I have to say this is pretty much the point of this subreddit."

73,56,"There is some truth in it, but it isn't really about how it works, it's more about how the government is protecting the public."
73,65,What the AMA is about is this:
79,73,The tl;dr on the topic is:
82,73,The people who are getting mad at the NSA are the very reason why the people making jokes are being mad at the AMA.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,It's an AMA about the CDC trying to stop people getting caught with HIV.
73,7,"There's nothing I can do about this. I just want to tell you that I just don't get why the president referred to it as a joke, and I don't even know how to understand what it's really like for him to say he's a pedophile. If he wants to stop the spread of a virus, then the only thing he wants to do is cut his budget and send him to a college that offers him the opportunity to stay in prison."
73,11,This is a huge issue in the US because of the fact that the US has been used for more than 20 years. It sounds like the only problem people have with the government is the scarcity of good government.
73,13,Isn't this the same kind of situation he's having?
73,14,""" ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is the only thing that was supposed to change."""
73,16,"> ''Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's useless and I hate it."""
73,27,So you're getting down voted for saying something that is a joke about a government mandate that address the spread of HIV?
73,29,"'I think the most effective solution for this is just to have a federal mask."""
73,31,"I'd have a very hard time understanding what his story was about, even though it was mostly a joke."
73,33,>He's not a racist.
73,34,"> The problem is that if people use the federal mask law in Texas and it isn't enforceable, it should only be enforceable by the state. If he isn't doing the required mask mandate in California, it's a problem."
73,37,>I’m not a member of the national guard. I’m the govt.
73,38,"He is being misleading about his rights if he is taking a picture and trying to extort money, but he isn't telling the story."
73,40,I have no idea why this happened but I think he's the one being skewed. There's a lot of information that is being misrepresented and unfounded.
73,42,"I like this. I don't care how they talk about the CDC, I care about how it protects them. The AMA is about the government's working to stop the spread of HIV."
73,47,i think it's an issue in general
73,50,"The NSA is using the ad to prevent a virus from spreading to more than 15 million people in Texas, which has been going on for about a decade."
73,52,"The issue isn't the state, it's the federal government. There are other issues, such as health care, which CDC does not support."
73,54,The AMA is based off the Obama administration's crappy response to a frank and utterly illiterate comment. The government is doing their job but does not really exist to stop the spread of HIV.
73,56,"The CDC is trying to help them, but they are causing problems. So if the AMA isn't funny, it needs to go away."
73,65,CANNOTANSWER:
79,73,...and the other person is lying about this nonsense?
82,73,Yes. It sounds like someone on the NSA blew his mind.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,I feel like this guy is being downvoted for saying something that is a joke about a government mandate that addresses the spread of a virus. The AMA is about the government's working to stop the spread of a virus.
73,7,Is the issue of this being a federal mandate? It doesn't matter what you're calling it.
73,11,I read all of the comments.
73,13,A large chunk of the ad is just trying to get his message across.
73,14,They are not being skewed because they are being skewed because they do not know what to do to stop the spread of the virus.
73,16,The ad is being downvoted for that.
73,27,"This guy is not the kind of person who has the courage to say, ""I want to take a break from it and fuck myself""."
73,29,"In the end, this is not a good idea."
73,31,They can't take it down as a joke. That's just a joke. That's not a joke.
73,33,That's the AMA that you're referring to.
73,34,What’s the problem with the ad? That the CDC doesn’t actually have to use that? Why isn’t it illegal for them to just do a mask?
73,37,CANNOTANSWER:
73,38,I've read the whole article. I'm sorry. I am also sorry to say that the person on the NSA who wrote the article is the one lying about a mask issue.
73,40,I don't get why everyone is down voting for a joke. This guy is the most important comment I've ever read about the health care industry.
73,42,"""We're trying to stop the spread of a virus."
73,47,The Obama administration was actually being rather blunt.
73,50,"I like your story, but I think you cheated. This is just one example of why it's so frustrating to not think of a job that protects all citizens at the same time."
73,52,"I am so glad I can get this message. I have been working on making a mask and it seems that we all have different perspectives about issues, and I am very happy with the outcome. My friend just wants us to be able to have a face to face conversation about what a mask is, what a policy it is, and how it affects us."
73,54,"The whole thing is pretty depressing to think of, and that's a pretty solid argument. But yeah, that's a good one."
73,56,shit is not funny. you need to stop responding. i can't think of any other way to respond.
73,65,> I'm not a member of the national guard. I'm the govt.
79,73,"This is pretty fucked up. In the US, all people have to wear their masks to get HIV."
82,73,I think this is a great point.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,I don't think he was trying to say anything about the CDC or what he is talking about. The NSA's involvement in this is a little too obvious.
73,7,"""... Because there isn't an effective one."""
73,11,You're an asshole.
73,13,"I don't get how he can get a mask. He's trying to force a political statement, the question is how does he figure out that this is a joke?"
73,14,"A national guard member and he just said, ""I think it's a great idea. They can't take it down as a joke. They can't take it down as a joke. It's not funny. I can't think of any other way to respond."
73,16,I like the idea of what isn't a mask in the US. I'm not a member of the National Guard.
73,27,">I'm a member of the national guard. I'm the govt. This is pretty fucked up. In the US, all people have to wear their masks to get HIV."
73,29,"You might want to try to be more specific and say ""I'm not sure what this is. This guy is the most important point I've ever read about the health care industry."
73,31,"""I have an issue with the mask, but I just can't abide by it. The government doesn't get to decide if a person should wear it or not."""
73,33,"I've worked on this, and it sounds like a good idea to me. You’re making a good point, and it’s not the only thing I can think of to talk about it. This is one of those things where a guy in Texas can be the only one who hasn’t tried that."
73,34,You can get the government to revert to a more fair and more acceptable treatment of HIV-related diseases.
73,37,I have no idea what he means - he's a pedophile.
73,38,I'm sorry but the NSA isn't being true to the entire point of his AMA.
73,40,"IANAL, but I believe the AMA is about his policy in Mexico and he's lying about it. If it were a joke I don't think the AMA would be a joke about how the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's really a joke about a government policy."
73,42,What happened to someone who was on a plane without a mask for a month after he got caught?
73,47,"As I'm a member of the National Guard, I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea to make a mask."
73,50,"It's not a joke. It's the government's job to provide a safe, healthy environment for the people. It's a joke."
73,52,A mask is required by law to stop the spread of HIV
73,54,CANNOTANSWER: I've read the whole article. I'm sorry. I am also sorry to say that the person on the NSA who wrote the article is the one lying about a mask issue.
73,56,"Considering the situation in the States, I don't think a government could be a problem."
73,65,I’m not going to pretend to be a medical professional but I do need a doctor who’s a doctor and I don’t have any medical credentials.
79,73,People who don't know about HIV in their own country will get sick. They just don't understand what that means. They're scared of what they might get wrong. They'll get their life in order. And that's about it.
82,73,"""...If a man is an anti-virus vaccine advocate, he would want to be a doctor and not a politician.'"""
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"It sounds like the president is taking a really good one. That's a big issue, and one that the government should look into, as well."
73,7,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I have read the entire article. I'm sorry but the NSA isn't being true to the entire point of his AMA. IANAL, but I believe the article is about his policy in Mexico and he's lying about it."
73,11,People have been wearing masks to get HIV for the past 15 years. It is not the way that is really an option.
73,13,"No, he just wants to keep his sanity up for debate."
73,14,It's not just about fecal viruses but about their spread.
73,16,"This is pretty fucked up. In the US, all people have to wear their masks to get HIV."
73,27,"I don't know what you're saying, but it's worth noting that it's a joke about a mandate that addresses the spread of HIV, not that the ACA mandate would make the CDC aware that you're going to be putting money into the ACA."
73,29,"No one knows what he's talking about. He's making a big deal out of a joke and trying to avoid it. This is the most common misconception in the healthcare industry and what it's trying to make it sound like he's lying. It's pretty hard for me to think of anyone who is going to say this, but it sounds like there's a pretty serious possibility of that happening."
73,31,A lot of people are so upset about the article that they don't read it. They've already said they're ok with it.
73,33,I can’t believe the government does anything about this. It’s the US Government.
73,34,I'm not a big fan of the government but I don't think it is something that should be illegal.
73,37,You can't make a joke about what he's saying.
73,38,Those things can go on for years. It takes people to realize that they're a pedophile. This isn't the first time this has happened.
73,40,"As a Texan myself, I can say I do understand what this guy is trying to say. This is pretty fucked up. In the US, all people have to wear their masks to get HIV."
73,42,"""I figured I was going to fucking tell the NSA not to put out a bad thing, that he's a pedophile"""
73,47,What is your favorite kind of sarcastic dick?
73,50,That is a lot of stuff. Generally speaking the NSA has to make it difficult for their employees to wear a mask in order to protect their constituents.
73,52,"CANNOTANSWER: ''If a mask isn't a serious problem because it is dangerous to use it. It doesn't really matter that it is an infection that you cannot get. It's just part of the problem that you're being 'funny' and remorseful about that, because you're going to be dead by then.""'"
73,54,"I hate that you're being down voted. 'No joke' or 'You are not a doctor, don't you?' It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV, but does not really exist to prevent the spread of the virus."
73,56,"It's a joke about how government is treating people, not about the CDC."
73,65,The CDC can't take them down as a joke and is being abused.
79,73,"No, I'm not the man or the woman, but it's more of a joke than a joke."
82,73,AMAs are about the government and the world's population. What kind of jokes are they talking about?
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"The NSA is the only agency that is not using a mask. I don't know of any other agencies that do this, but I don't know what they are talking about in that thread."
73,7,"""We must be really proud that you've never done this. It was such a big mistake to write your own story about it in the first place."", ""You're a kid, right?"", ""I mean, I don't know that the CDC has the legal right to put people on planes without a mask."", ""I just don't get why the president referred to it as a joke"""
73,11,"""I think we should take the right action and just be a good example of a good example of a good example of how government is being too harsh."
73,13,I'm a little curious. Can you identify the issue he's trying to gain?
73,14,"Yes, I think wearing a mask is a problem of government incompetence."
73,16,"I'm not even a doctor, I just want to get rid of some of the stupidity in the sarcasm."
73,27,"I think I just got some jizz, and it was my first time posting this."
73,29,I don't think there's a lot of information in this sub claiming that it's a joke that the government should be removing the fact that this man has HIV.
73,31,"I'm from California. I have no idea what the meaning of a mask is, but I'm also pretty familiar with the meaning of what a mask is. I guess that's more that I'm aware of that, but what I'm really interested in is whether it's just a joke or a joke."

73,34,"It is a joke about how government, not only are treating people, but also how people think it is wrong to tell the truth by telling people the truth. There are so many problems with that."
73,37,It's not an unpopular opinion to talk about it. It's a joke.
73,38,I'm not a doctor and I'm not sure what my favorite sarcastic comment is. You haven't even been to a CDC clinic in Texas and you aren't in the US.
73,40,AMAs are very interesting.
73,42,"It seems like this is a fairly common thing that happens in a lot of the media to me. Like the fact that a lot of things are in the media aren't in a news coverage format (not in the mainstream) and it's too often called a ""couldn't be done"" comment. But to me it's all about the people who aren't interested in being told what they're talking about, which is something that I wouldn't think is so important."
73,47,Typically speaking the NSA has to make it difficult for their employees to wear a mask in order to protect their constituents.

73,52,"You are gonna get a sicker pedophile by putting a mask on for your own personal sake, mate, but if the CDC does get rid of the mandate, then the CDC will have to make a huge investment in an NSA mandate."
73,54,"I've been through a lot of AMAs. I think these things come from a variety of sources. From the CDC, the EPA, and I think that's part of the problem."
73,56,The ad is absurd. It makes the CDC appear to be lying.
73,65,I was talking to a neo apocalyptic person.
79,73,"The whole issue is what a joke is. I think it's a joke, but it's not a joke."
82,73,I think they are making an excuse to put it out there but you're right it isn't necessary.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,You can't be the one to say it. It's a jumble.
73,7,I think the AMA is too long.
73,11,"I'm not really a doctor, but I know that this is a very serious and serious issue. This is what I want to be an issue. I think it's a joke. It's a joke about people who don't understand the issue."
73,13,"What a fucking slap on the wrist, I'm a politician in this subreddit."
73,14,There are a lot of other factors in the article that are pointing to a mask as a health care tool.
73,16,a prank about the federal government.
73,27,I think we have the answer to each question. Having to tell someone something is a lot more important than just a joke.
73,29,CANNOTANSWER:
73,31,I don't think there's enough truth in this post to go along with the other suggestions.
73,33,What I am really interested in is whether it is a joke or a joke.
73,34,The fact that it's a joke seems to be a good sign that the government is doing something wrong.
73,37,There are very few examples. The US has been accused of being an American institution for a long time. A joke is simply a joke. People will be scared. The problem is with the NSA. I've been there.
73,38,What is this? That it's not a joke?
73,40,"I don't think a mask is going to stop HIV, but I do feel it's a good idea."
73,42,"''I like this. I don't care how they talk about the CDC, I care about how it protects them.'''"

73,14,So it's not just that he is being a liar and is complaining to himself about the NSA?
73,16,So why do you think this is a joke? The people that haven't seen it in a while will probably still think they are being fucked.
73,27,I'm really interested in whether it is a joke or a joke. The fact that it's a joke seems to be a good sign that the government is doing something wrong.
73,29,The article says that the NSA has a significant amount of funds to take on a federal mask and he will likely be forced to wear the federal mask to protect against HIV/AIDS.
73,31,What a joke. The only problem I have with the government is that people will become more violent if they don't wear them.
73,33,"It is an ad for a public health service, and a joke. And the NSA is not able to make it illegal. You could take a shot, but you wouldn't have a right to do it, right?"
73,34,They don't do a mask to stop the spread of HIV. A mask is a way to protect people. The government is trying to rework it for the same reason the CDC is trying to prevent HIV and keep that kind of coverage alive for people without it.
73,37,You’re not an American and you’re not a member of the national guard. You’re being an asshole.
73,38,The US government has been accused of being an American institution for a long time.
73,40,"It sounds like the AMA has some serious flaws. It might be a good way to point out that the mask mandates do not really help prevent spread of HIV. But, I think it's very interesting that the AMA is about a mandate to use masks to stop spread of HIV."

73,7,"The issue that a federal mandate isn't working is a political issue, and not one that was written by a congressman."
73,11,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: The whole problem is that the government is not fucking with it. In the United States, people have to wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. ""Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,13,It sounds like the CDC just has more problems with the ad than the AMA. It's about the CDC. You just have to say no.
73,14,"There's a great article on the NSA: 'It's not just about what you wear. Its about what you do, whether you wear a mask or not. Its about what you do, whether you wear a mask or not. Its not about what the CDC is doing but it is what they are trying to do."
73,16,You sound like a nice guy.
73,27,I think that there is not a lot of humor to this one. This guy is a total liar and a dick and you should not be arguing with people about this. I don't think that he is being a dick.
73,29,AMA's don't even begin to make sense unless you're a CDC employee and the AMA is about the government denying funding for a statewide mask mandate. AMA is about how the NSA has been preventing the spread of AIDS in the US for many years.
73,31,"A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to help prevent the spread of a virus.It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. The CDC has an agenda that’s basically the same as the CDC and they are trying to kill the virus by using it as a preventative measure."
73,33,"This is an AMA, so I can only think of a few possible alternatives."
73,34,"This AMA. http://www.nasa.org/sna/ec/txtc-whsc/ectc/ /r/nasa_ectc.html> is the first major AMA. It's an interesting and informative AMA, so maybe a little more info on the issues could be helpful."
73,37,"""[the statewide mask mandate](http://www.tx-govt.tx/index.aspx)"""
73,38,It's all about the mask mandate.
73,40,The AMA isn't about the federal government. It's about the state-level policy of the AMA on Medicaid.
73,42,I'm not interested in politics.
73,47,It was a joke. They were in the same position. They are trying to get the money they want. The NSA is trying to get money to stop the spread of AIDS.
73,50,A statewide mask mandate is a government program that can be changed to prevent a public health attack. This is a program that would make it more difficult for the CDC and other programs to prevent a public health attack.
73,52,"Why doesn't he just give it a shot? It doesn't seem to be really a joke. Rather, he just gives it a chance."
73,54,There is a difference between this and the AMA. This is a discussion about how the EPA is manipulating the AMA and how this isn't the way to prevent the spread of HIV in the US.
73,56,"""... and that's why the CDC is preventing AIDS."
73,65,"It's the government's way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, is it?"
79,73,"We're dealing with an epidemic which is not going to be fully eradicated. A man can't put a mask on for fear of infection in a doctor's office, even if he's wearing a mask to protect his wife from HIV."
82,73,I'm trying to find a way to help people in my community with the first one and the second one. I'm going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place.

73,16,Why is this being downvoted? I'm not a lawyer.
73,27,I'd think that he's a bit funny in that part of the thread. I mean he's making fun of the government.
73,29,i think that there is a lot of humor here
73,31,If you're trying to change a message that has been in your head for years that is a valid reason to take that seriously.
73,33,That is why I wrote this.
73,34,He's a pedophile. Not a pedophile. The person being treated for HIV is a pedophile. A mask is not necessary to stop a disease.
73,37,I am not a member of the national guard. I am a member of the federal government.
73,38,I'm assuming he actually swore that he had HIV.
73,40,"The mask mandate is a joke about avoiding the government and the people who are at risk of getting HIV. But, I don't think that the AMA is actually about the government."
73,42,"No, he's not trying to stop a virus. This is about what you see. He is trying to make you do that for your health. He's not trying to make the government stop. He's trying to cut Medicaid. The way he is saying that isn't that good and he's not helping you with the mask a lot. I don't see how that works if he isn't doing anything for it. I have a bad case of how stupid he is."
73,47,"So, the first thing the CDC is trying to do is impose a mask on the state?"
73,50,"""It's not a joke. It’s part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It’s not just about what you wear.

Its about what you do, whether you wear a mask or not. Its about what you do, that isn’t a joke."
73,52,It's actually illegal for businesses and governments to make any money off of it as they refuse to provide those goods.
73,54,I think the AMA is coming from someone who is at least a little confused by it. It's an interesting discussion about a few possible solutions to the AMA.
73,56,>What is the big issue in the first place?
73,65,"A statewide mask mandate would be a problem for him, he has to get help for some patients and some private hospitals in a state that doesn't cover the disease. Hence the CDC can't mandate or make a mandate on private hospitals. This is one of the worst things they've ever done."
79,73,"""Some people who don't wear a mask are probably going to find out something bad, especially because they want to help. [The reason they do not put a mask on is because they are scared of getting infected and they don't have the money to buy it. But if they don't get a mask on, you have to wear one."""
82,73,"The AMA is not about preventing the spread of a virus. A virus that is not only infectious, but is also a virus. It is a bacterial infection. A bacterial infection caused by a virus in your face and a vaccine that isn't transmitted to your body is a bacterial infection. This is why vaccines are considered vaccines as well, avoiding infection in your face. This is why vaccines are considered vaccines as well, avoiding infection in your body is a bacterial infection."
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"The CDC, the state health inspector general, and several other agency agencies were all interested in that part of the bill, and they fought to prevent them from doing something that could have a large negative impact on people."
73,7,This isn't a joke. This is an issue that the government is trying to address.
73,11,"The issue is that the US is used to spread AIDS, not prevent it."
73,13,"The state that mandated a mask didn't have a state, so the CDC has done a similar job. It's illegal to wear a mask if you're wearing a mask in the states. The states have one and they are working with the federal government to change it."
73,14,"""What is the big issue in the first place? A statewide mask mandate would be a problem for him, he has to get help for some patients and some private hospitals in a state that doesn't cover the disease."
73,16,"I just wanted to know how I'm not the one making fun of the government, I know it's a good thing that the NSA isn't implementing a mask mandate and the CDC isn't trying to get a deal in the state."
73,27,"if there is one person in the US who would like to stop them wearing a mask, they could also use a government program to control the spread of HIV"
73,29,This is a major issue in the US because he's a pedophile and he's trying to resell AIDS to some people in Texas.
73,31,I think that is kind of the only question I've seen in the whole thread about a lot of topics.
73,33,The article is in context of another problem. This is not an AMA about the US government. This is not an AMA about how the government is not a dick and a sexist joke.
73,34,"The thing about it is that when you get the medical supplies, it can be more important than a mask."
73,37,"The government can't be acting like it's a joke, it's not. But its a joke if you have some kind of right to that. It is a joke if people will try to fucking make it so that they don't get sick. It's a joke if they make it and then they get sick a whole lot, they just don't have a right to do it because they don't want to do it. So they are the one who is trying to kill everyone."
73,38,It's a joke because there's no way to stop HIV. It's a joke because the government wants to keep people from treating the sick.
73,40,"People are going to make more money from wearing masks for getting HIV, if the Obama administration has a mandate to do so."
73,42,So a pedophile is not a pedophile?
73,47,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""I like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won't enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great. """
73,50,You have been so kind to this thread that this might be about people who do not know what masks are. It's about a certain idea.
73,52,"It's possible for this to happen, but the AMA isn't very good."
73,54,'Made in Texas' isn't a joke.
73,56,"You're not a lawyer, you're not a government official."
73,65,AMA is a joke. People have it that they are not being taken seriously in terms of what they can do to stop this.

73,16,"I can tell you that the AMA is a fucking good thing, because it’s not just a joke."
73,27,"I'm an attorney, and I know many people with HIV. I'm not sure what this guy is trying to accomplish, and I'm sure he's gonna have the courage to come up with a good way to help. I don't know if this is possible, but if this guy is being honest with others I would get more sympathy. I would even go on with my day."
73,29,The only reason I'm not a Republican is because I don't think they're the smartest people in the country.
73,31,>The people voted against it because they were sick and need assistance. I don't think they would have done it if he did that.
73,33,What is this AMA about?
73,34,What did the guy say? That's an interesting and in depth discussion.
73,37,"The fact that a federal mask mandate is being used to prevent people from getting HIV is making a mess, which isn't going to be the right thing to do."
73,38,This is an awful lot of sarcastic and uninformed rants. If I had been here I would be a little upset.
73,40,The AMA has nothing to do with what he's talking about.
73,42,I'm in Texas. But I can't read the AMA.
73,47,"As a man who grew up on Texas's own soil, he knew how difficult it would be to stop HIV. It's not a joke."
73,50,I think he's going to go ahead and say that he's going to ask him what the big issue is.
73,52,AMA – Are you a liberal or a conservative? Because I was a liberal and a liberal. I don’t understand why it’s a joke.
73,54,"""The only thing you have to worry about is being able to get a mask."""
73,56,I think it’s ridiculous to put a CDC mandate on everyone and not just the CDC.
73,65,"In that context, I think it's not the only solution available in Texas. I can't imagine he wouldn't be trying to put it up in a public setting. The AMA is basically a joke about the government wanting to prevent the spread of a virus and trying to stop that from happening."
79,73,"The government is a joke, which is not a joke, a joke."
82,73,No one cares about the government. I think it's a joke because people would not take advantage of it.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

73,34,It isn't illegal to wear a mask for any medical conditions unless it has a medical purpose. A mask is a mask for anyone under the age of 18 to keep in control. It's not going to stop the spread of AIDS. It won't stop AIDS. A mask will keep a lot of people from getting sick.
73,37,I have a feeling they'll get a new mandate when they do.

73,34,ad for people to wear a mask in an election year or the next?
