57,12,I've gotten a lot of sick people. I don't really think the CDC is doing it for the very same reason it does for the rest of the world.
58,12,oh and now we get the snobby pigeon that wears a mask. Is that right?
60,12,"Yes, but it doesn't change anything. The more people who wear a mask, the more vulnerable they become to the infection, which in turn reduces the risk of the infection. Besides, the person is less likely to die from an infection because the mask is actually better to treat."
88,12,I know some people do this with the same mask in every country I have ever run.
90,12,We have two types of rules in the country. One is to have a hilarity. The other is that a hilarity is always a hilarity. This is the government's way to prevent the spread of a virus.

21,12,Well...this shit gets real tidbits.
22,12,I don't think it matters why people don't wear a mask in a hospital in an area that they can't be vaccinated?
36,12,What's a good joke? A bad joke? The article isn't accurate ie the fad - not the true issue but the general shit - it's not a joke and we should never try to fix it.
37,12,There are no actual measures that were drafted. Just the federal government.

15,12,I think the whole question is: what does the president do when his wife gets sick? What does he do if he becomes sick in his life? Why do he wear a mask?

15,12,"In the book: ""The CDC's AMA is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
19,12,I read the article on the front page of The Wire. It was pretty funny. It was written by a man who was trying to prevent the spread of a virus. He said that wearing a mask is the most important and important part of the prevention of HIV. He said that wearing a mask is the most important and important part of the prevention of HIV.'' I thought it was pretty funny.
21,12,"This is the one. The doctor said he'd be on the list if not on the list of potentially serious cases, and that is not a joke, just a joke. 'I am afraid you won't get yours, but I think that's an obvious one.'"
22,12,"The joke isn't about preventing a virus, it's about helping a human to get the disease."
36,12,"I don't have a lot of good jokes, but I just have a lot of bad jokes. I don't really care about people who do, I just don't care about the people who do."
37,12,"I'm not sure the state of HIV prevention is an exception, as they want to make it harder to control it without being ripped from the book."
57,12,"Weird, but it's not really a joke, it's just a joke. Vaccines aren't needed. Because vaccines aren't required for people who work in public health. Vaccines aren't legally required for people who work in public health."
58,12,"Yes, it is a joke. It is a joke, and the humor is there to make you feel better."
60,12,"So basically just saying ""The government doesn't like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they don't want to help."""
88,12,"You said a joke? EDIT: 'Mom, I was in the hospital to find this out, so I ran a half marathon and everyone said I ran all the time as well. I ran that race, and everyone said I did it.

19,12,"I think we're going to see a joke about putting people in a mask, but it's not the joke. It's the joke that's causing them discomfort."
21,12,Vaccines are not legally required for doctors in most states. I do not think the law on them is a joke. But it does make a lot of sense to me that the government is trying to protect us from the spread of the disease.
22,12,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""I think it is interesting that in the AMA you are saying that wearing a mask is a bit sarcastic about how to protect from the CDC, they've pushed the NSA, so they're not going to have the full effect of a virus on the general public."
36,12,Is there any way that people are actually talking about a viral disease on wiki? Because the article seems to be a rip off of it and I don't really care about that.
37,12,Is the government ignoring the fact that it's illegal for someone to wear a mask?
57,12,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: It's a joke about how people think the government is doing something to prevent the spread of a virus."
58,12,Why isn't this in r/tilhesherpets?
60,12,That's because the government isn't trying to help the people who are being vaccinated. I don't think people who are getting sick are really going to get it. You are coming off as a bit of a jerk and are trying to make you uncomfortable. It's just not what I want. I do feel that this kind of behavior should be banned and they should be given more freedom of speech and a way to prevent it.
88,12,"This is what I was looking for: a CDC (or a medical group) based on what I am seeing, and what I have heard / read."
90,12,It doesn't say how to prevent an outbreak but I believe the people being eloquent that make the jokes are not the jokes themselves.

19,12,I think'stuff' is a joke.
21,12,"Its a joke, and it's a joke because it's not what it says, which is why it isn't legal. I would probably want a joke too. But when I hear it, I'm not going to think about it in the same way it did when I heard it, or why the joke isn't as funny and the joke isn't. The AMA, I guess, makes me chuckle."
22,12,"I'm actually kinda edgy about that AMA. It's really interesting, and I'll go back to my AMA as soon as I'm done."
36,12,"I've been wearing masks for years, and have heard of many jokes about this topic."
37,12,Are you referring to a spoof article about a CIA agent that isn't a member of the CDC?

58,12,I'm a physician so my job is a good start.
60,12,AMA. As a person that has experienced a similar situation I can say a few things about a doc:
88,12,"I mean, it isn't really just a joke."
90,12,"It is a joke. I think it's a joke, and I don't even have a proper understanding of a joke. It's a joke."
12,3,"It's pretty much a joking joke, you know."
15,12,I just want to give you a few more examples of jokes made up in these threads.
19,12,"The truth, the truth. It's a joke, and a joke is a joke."
21,12,The only thing it says is that it isn't illegal. The AMA says it isn't legal.

60,12,"I think the problem is that this kind of behavior should be banned. As it isn't about the government, it's a joke about the government's role."
88,12,What's the joke? How many people do they know about the government? I know nothing about them.
90,12,So there is an official article in a thread about this. I just read it and decided to reread it to get clearer understanding. It was in fact in fact in an article about the CDC trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and what it is. It's about the people in this sub (people who are being ridiculous and have been getting more attention for the past couple months) who are referring to this ad. They are trying to prevent a virus spread and what is going on at the time.
12,3,It seems that the joke is funny. I don't get why anyone has a problem with it.
15,12,"It is a joke, not a fact."
19,12,"Well, what a bunch of trolls you talk to. The article that he was speaking about, ""Vaccines are a joke,"" seems like a troll and a joke."
21,12,"It's just an AMA. A AMA is about the government helping people who are sick, or people who don't want to get vaccinated."
22,12,">The whole joke is about how the government is doing this, so it's not a joke."
36,12,"People ARE saying that vaccinations are not something you need to wear, but aren't an essential part of a proper vaccination program. This is a joke. You have a mask, a mask, and an hat for your job. You need to get the mask and have it fitted so you don't have to spend too much time there."

57,12,I'm not saying that 'the government is doing it for a reason' but if it was a joke you'd have to explain why.
58,12,It's funny because it's not a joke.

90,12,"I am a huge fan of your ideas, but it's still very confusing. It's one of the few things you can do to not get stung in public."
12,3,"Then it would be hilarious if you would say something like, ""I'm getting ready to put on a mask and I can't stop doing it. I'm getting ready to do a bunch of Avatars runs."" I guess it's a joke, but to be honest, the AMA is just an attempt at making the joke a joke."
15,12,"This is why the CDC does NOT force a mask on people. It is a joke, not a fact."
19,12,I don't think the guy has a clue what this joke is about. It's a joke because I am a bit tired of talking to people who haven't heard of this before.
21,12,"I don't get why a joke doesn't have to do with what it says, but a'snarky' AMA doesn't."
22,12,"Yes, you're correct. This isn't a joke, it's a warning."

37,12,"""I'm a doctor, but I'm not a doctor. The CDC, however, is incompetent.

60,12,I think it would be a good idea to wear a mask and bend over.
88,12,"A CDC worker says a CDC person doesn't have a job because the CDC has to make sure that if people are not informed, the CDC will help them."
90,12,I think the fact that this is a joke makes it a good joke and it can have meaning. The point is the most important thing to do is to talk to people about it.
12,3,I think the joke is making it funny.
15,12,"""I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of wearing a mask at parties because I don't like it,"""
19,12,Vaccines are a joke if it's not just for people with HIV and they don't want to put people in one. That's what makes the joke funny if the joke is about vaccinations
21,12,"""It's a joke, and it's a joke because it's not what it says, which is why it isn't legal."""
22,12,This is a very good thing and one that may be very important for our public health.
36,12,That is all the information that makes this whole whole thing seem so ridiculous.

58,12,"The AMA is a joke, not a joke."
60,12,Is the government a joke? I think they should be banned.
88,12,"This is not a joke, this is a joke."
90,12,"I like to think of it in a way where people are taking a lot of chances to laugh at jokes. Especially when they're pointing out the facts of the jokes. If I'm pointing that out to my friends that I'm a joke, it's an irrational joke. Isn't this just an irrational joke?"
12,3,It was made to be a joke. It was made to be a joke.
15,12,I think the CDC is trying to be a joke here.
19,12,"Vaccines are not the joke. It's just a joke that people who think they will be immune to a virus, have a virus, are susceptible to an infection."
21,12,It is a joke because it is a joke. AMA's and AMAs are meant to be fun and humorous if it isn't actually a joke.
22,12,"I've read an article in the Guardian about people having to wear masks to prevent their doctor being 'harmed' by a virus : ""I know I'm not a doctor, but I think they are trying to teach people how to prevent disease, not just a joke."

60,12,I'd like to add the following:
88,12,"I feel the message of the article is that we need to understand what is being made and not what is being made. Rather than make a joke about how people are afraid to run, we need to acknowledge that the public's perception of the government is important."
90,12,"""The problem is that the people who are being eloquent about it."
12,3,I don't think the joke is a joke. The joke is a joke that is not true at all.

19,12,> I read the title in a sarcastic tone.
21,12,The CDC needs to know what is going on and how to enforce it. There's plenty of times where people are worried the truth isn't going to come out.

37,12,"It's a joke, not a rip off. It's a joke, and it's not a ripoff."

21,12,"> A person who has a doctor's license, but not a doctor, is not a doctor."
22,12,The whole point of the AMA is that it's about preventing HIV and AIDS and is also an attempt to get rid of the government.
36,12,> I think the AMA is all about the joke.
37,12,"""What is the difference between a joke and a joke?"""
57,12,"No way. It's a joke. This is a joke, but this is what it is."
58,12,In this case I am so glad we both understand how much the AMA is about.
60,12,I can't believe how a cult like that guy actually said that.

12,3,"It's funny. People wear masks to hide their disease, because they don't want to. People don't want to hide their disease or get tested if they can't. But it's ridiculous. People are making the jokes to mask the problem because they don't want to. People aren't trying to hide their disease."
15,12,I am a doctor and I want to make the world a better place.
19,12,Isn't that why it's called a joke? It's a joke. And that's what a joke is.
21,12,"In some places, a doctor with a license is not required to wear a mask every day."
22,12,This is a good thing and one that may be very important for our public health.
36,12,>I would probably get over it.
37,12,This is a very specific situation. You need to get a CDC report.

60,12,I'm also a doc and have a mask that's sexy enough to cover my head with a blanket and get my hands on my own clothes. It's a great way to keep your feet warm and make you feel more comfortable. The one in the photo is sexy enough to keep you on your feet and a neck and a hand as long as you have good airflow and a decent amount of breathing space.
88,12,The joke is the joke. People are afraid of the government. This is why the CDC is not funded by the public.

15,12,"Vaccines aren't mandatory in the US and aren't mandated, so no one really knows about the safety of putting a mask on people. Then what else can we do besides to avoid it?"
19,12,"I'm gonna go through the AMA with a doctor right now. I've done a lot of this before and it seems like a pretty reasonable approach. If you're a doctor and you're into the movie, that's a good thing! But the fact that the guy made the joke is a joke. They're not being racist or any kind of troll based on the AMA."
21,12,"The AMA is so interesting, and the joke is kind of like this: it's about the vaccine being released and not about whether people can get vaccinated."
22,12,"The article is about the AMA, not the actual AMA."
36,12,"OP: ""I would probably get over it."""
37,12,"This article is about a woman who is attempting to come into a public health clinic without a mask, so while the guy is a joke, they are also making fun of the woman."

60,12,The joke should be banned. Its kind of a joke and not about the government. Its about trying to prevent the spread of a virus and how it makes people feel.
88,12,I don't think that's the point of the article.
90,12,"I don't think this is a good joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke."
12,3,I read the AMA for a while and I still have it.
15,12,The fact that you've not heard the phrase 'Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is a joke' makes me wonder if 'The government has no say over whether or not people wear a mask outside if they are at a party or if they want to be vaccinated' is a joke about the CDC.
19,12,"The movie is a joke, but it's about preventing the spread of AIDS."
21,12,i read that he was the one who said he needed to wear a mask during the epidemic and a neurologist said he couldn't use the mask for the disease.
22,12,"""Vaccines are not for life"" is a joke. ""I have no recollection of a guy with HIV who couldn't even afford it to wear a mask, in an area where people with insurance cards aren't allowed to have access to safe medicine""."
36,12,I think you need to write down every single phrase you've written for me.

12,3,This is a joke about the CDC.
15,12,What does a joke like a joke mean to me?
19,12,"It's not that you should wear a mask, it's that you should wear a mask."
21,12,The AMA has a lot of good points. I think it's one of those.
22,12,"In order to prevent people from getting HIV, you have to wear a mask. The whole AMA is about preventing the spread of HIV. It's not about preventing it."
36,12,I'm just going to guess that what you wrote makes me realize that the title of the article is wrong.
37,12,I have seen a lot of articles about a troll trying to spread the virus. I'm in the CDC.
57,12,I'm not going to explain what this is about but you are going to be in the end and you're going to be in the end. It's not like the joke is a joke.
58,12,"AMA isn't a joke. The joke is about the government. The AMA is about vaccines, and AMA isn't about vaccinations."

19,12,[Like [[NAME]: ''We have to wear a mask as a defense mechanism to prevent the spread of a virus.''
21,12,A doctor without a license isn't a doctor. It's a job. They don't like to make fun of themselves and don't want to tell their patients that. If they want a doctor who has not a license and isn't licensed a doctor has to be a doctor.
22,12,"It is very hard to say, in this case, why a government-run program would make them a joke. It would be a joke to do in any case, especially as it's something that should be taken very seriously."
36,12,"I'm not an expert but the article was referring to a joke, not something about the government. It was written in order to make fun of a viral disease."
37,12,I see why this is a joke. The CDC and the CDC are two separate things.
