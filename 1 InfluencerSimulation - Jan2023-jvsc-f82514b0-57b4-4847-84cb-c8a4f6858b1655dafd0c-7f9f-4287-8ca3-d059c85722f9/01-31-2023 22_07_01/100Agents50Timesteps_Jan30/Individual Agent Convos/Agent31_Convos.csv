56,31,I understand what you mean by that but I do not believe this vaccine is the right thing to do. And he's clearly just trying to make a statement that is based on a false conclusion.

41,31,The word superheroes was coined in 1888. The word superspreader is used in the modern sense of the word.
44,31,So you're in a big deal. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.mask protect other people he only cares about himself.
53,31,"The second paragraph is pretty obvious to me, but I'd definitely suggest that someone who has never had a shave and do it while on a job in a public place get it and go."
56,31,If you want to hear a doctor say that someone who didn't go to an area to be vaccinated could possibly get a concussion.
60,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.hr sent out an email saying those of us who s fully vaxxed w proof can go maskless again in the office yea i m good i m still wearing my mask
73,31,"if there was a statewide mask mandate in California, they wouldn't have to apply for an individual person to wear it"
89,31,It's a great way to stop people from getting sick.

53,31,"I live in Florida. I'm a little confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean? Vaccinations are a dangerous disease. There's a lot of stuff about the mask that would not be covered. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or is a crime, it just means that it is a way to prevent people from getting the virus. And that's the one thing they haven't gotten -"
56,31,I don't think he has any objective reason to not wear a mask.
60,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,31,They want to take him to a medical center. A federal mask mandate shouldn't have to do it.
89,31,"There is no way to stop the spread of a virus, you are being a total nutjob. It is just more effective to help if you have a very healthy relationship with the virus and a family. That said, if you are going to go out and have a fun day and not a full body shower, then no, you don't have to go out."
95,31,>We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
31,3,I'm not even an official virus carrier. But I've had a few cases of them when I was a kid. I'm in a 'professional' relationship with a guy with the virus. And that makes me so nervous.
41,31,The fact that he is in a hospital with a virus doesn't mean he doesn't have any control over it. He isn't even allowed to wear a mask.
44,31,>The fact that he is wearing a mask
53,31,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they will take them on. I think everyone needs to see a doctor. If they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them. The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask. That's why people keep wearing them. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
56,31,"""...and then he says I think that this is something that has been made public and is intended to be done in order to help those people. I think that he's being so literal in that he doesn't want to use his face in the morning."
60,31,So you are wearing a mask and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over
73,31,He was a pedophile and would not have done it if he did that. I am still a little upset about that.
89,31,"It sounds like a funny, uninteresting title. That is just a very interesting one."
95,31,It's kind of like that for some kids. They'll probably only get the vaccinated if they're older than 4 or 5. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
31,3,The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask.
41,31,I've had to wear masks a few times. Some of the best I've ever experienced are the emaciated victims and the like. They are dangerous. They don't have control.
44,31,Well that's the joke.
53,31,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it's a good idea to start with a mask that's supposed to look like a band aid and let you have a go. I've seen people who have gotten the sarcasm, but they still have to wear them. The second amendment was a joke. I think it's not a joke, it's a joke. I've seen people who have gotten the sarcasm, but they still have to wear them. I think it's good idea to start with "
56,31,I don't get why they keep people with HIV in public health. Its pretty common to put people in sick areas and then have them on their side.
60,31,A person's stance on the topic of the government and how to prevent a virus is to go as far as a non-vaccinated person. That's a nonsense. It makes me sad that the government could help the government stop spreading viruses and is so anti-vaccinating. The government is not the ones who are actually threatening people.
73,31,"Yeah, the guy was a pedophile and would not have done it if he did that. He was a pedophile and wouldn't have done it if he did that."
89,31,I don't think this guy has a very deep understanding of why people think wearing a mask is a bad idea.
95,31,"It's one of those things. I sat there and sat there thinking, ""I sat there and sat there and sat there and sat there and sat there, but I sat there and sat there and sat there and sat there for 5 minutes, I sat there and sat there and sat there and sat there"" and I knew I was sat there crying. And if I could sat down and sat there and sat there, he still"
31,3,"As an actual person who had a phd, I would argue that it was a joke and not a joke."
41,31,"There is nothing that you need to do. We should talk to people, let them know that there is no government in this country that has the power to stop things like this."
44,31,You are being silly. In the beginning of a story there was a whole thread about how you can never be safe on the road. You are asking for a joke.
53,31,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
56,31,You sound like a nutjob and you're clearly being a dick. What do you think? You can't trust anyone to protect your health. You don't trust people who aren't infected with the virus.
60,31,I didn't realize it was the government.
73,31,"Having a mask isn't a good idea, just a part of the government redistributing aid in the face of an HIV outbreak. Regardless, that's not a good idea."
89,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm going to start a bit more about what I wear to protect myself.
95,31,"I see what you did there, it wasn't so much the question as the answer."
31,3,"OP was being a dick. I had a doctorate, but he couldn't wear a mask. He was wearing a band aid with a bandaid, and he couldn't get the sarcasm he was referring to in any form. He was doing that with a bandaid when he got sick, because he didn't know if the mask was safe. But that's not a joke."
41,31,[Waking a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,31,I've just heard the sexist part. There is no law regarding wearing a mask while a child hasn't been vaccinated.
53,31,">I'm a little confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean? Vaccines are for life."
56,31,"Wearing a mask does not help the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps it spread AIDS, it's useless and I hate it."
60,31,That's a fad. It doesn't make any sense. The fad has nothing to do with the government. It's about the people who are immune.
73,31,"I don't like the fact that he's on a mask, but I just can't abide by it. The government doesn't get to decide if a person should wear it or not."
89,31,"""The entire point of the joke is that it's a bad idea. People don't wear the mask because they are sick, they don't want to. They don't like it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
95,31,People who make their own posts about vaccinating children to keep the word out of the internet are just being obnoxious and inflammatory.
31,3,"OP's story: In a series about a family member, he says that he was on a mask because he was sick and he could not take it off."
41,31,What we can do is voluntarily wear a mask.
44,31,"You can't have a joke about AIDS. You can have a joke about people not wanting to risk the AIDS epidemic, or even just to be ignorant to people about it. The AMA does not really do anything. Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak. You're being silly. I'm not a child. I'm not saying he was referring to the AMA at all."
53,31,I had to get a mask to stop my immune system from getting the TB virus.
56,31,You can do what you want but don't want to help.
60,31,I'd love to know what you're thinking.
73,31,"It's a little creepy, but you should definitely be concerned that it's being misinterpreted."
89,31,"... The entire point of the joke is that it's a bad idea. People don't wear the mask because they are sick, they don't want to. They don't like it. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
95,31,What does 'We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated' mean?
31,3,The people who make their own posts about vaccinating children to keep the word out of the internet are just being obnoxious and inflammatory.
41,31,"I think this is a pretty shitty petty joke, but I still think a mask is a good idea, but I don't think they're willing to do it. They're too lazy to get their hopes up, even if it's to keep everyone away from the public, and there's no real reason to be in a relationship with a virus."
44,31,>You're being silly. I'm not a child. I'm not saying he was referring to the AMA at all.
53,31,I think you have a really good point. That’s probably the most offensive way to put it.
56,31,"> So in other news, I've heard that Texans who wear a mask can get a concussion."
60,31,I thought this was just a satire of the video's plot.
73,31,"I have an issue with the ad, I'm not sure what is being misinterpreted, but I'm sure someone has a similar issue with a bunch of things, such as that. I have a lot of good points to add."
89,31,It doesn't sound like a joke. It's a joke.
95,31,I guess it's the joke that got me the first word. That is how many people are making this joke. I think it's one of those things.
31,3,"I have to agree that the whole thing is ridiculous, but the fact that it’s a joke, is just a bit obnoxious and inflammatory."
41,31,Vaccines are largely for people who are in a medical position.
44,31,It's the most fun of all the jokes.
53,31,">the whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
56,31,I have never been in Texas with the aid of a mask but I will say it is the only way I have ever been in a state that I am not in a position to give it up.
60,31,A hr has been getting a lot of shit from people who do this and are not vaccinated. That's basically the whole point of the movie. The government should have known what it was and did.
73,31,"“The masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They need to see how this is misinterpreted. It’s all being cheesy and they need to really look at this more, or else they will become more violent."
89,31,"I'm a doctor and the idea is for people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, because you don't know when they'll be getting sick, and a mask is meant to protect them when you have to deal with an infection. If you're really sick, you'll be sick too and need to deal with a sickness."
95,31,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
31,3,"This is what is referred to in a lot of articles and commentary on this subreddit, including http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/educated-advice/advice-advice-report/tf.html>."
41,31,> Because 'People just get fucked when their government gets their face out and they're doing something that can't be done. It's not about the vaccines. It's about their health. They can't prevent the spread of a virus if they want to get it. It's not about the vaccines. It's about their health. They can't prevent the spread of a virus if they want to get it.
44,31,"IMHO that if you are in the US, you are very likely not going to be able to afemt the AMA. A lot of med school teachers like this in the US don't want to take you to the AMA. They say that they aren't going to be able to have the AMA done. They're just saying that if you wear a mask at school, you will only be able to have a med school experience. And because you aren't a doctor at work, this joke is a joke"
53,31,I'm a doctor and I'm always wondering what people are going to say when they get to the point where they know what the joke is. I just don't know what they're talking about.
56,31,"""Dr. Aesthetics, medicine, etc. It is essential to keep a patient safe,"""
60,31,Isn't this a joke? Why are all of these things a joke?
73,31,>Is wearing a mask a problem of government incompetence in Texas?
89,31,No it's a joke and isn't really a joke.
95,31,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
31,3,"In Texas, everyone wearing a mask is supposed to be a way of protecting their children from getting sick, allowing them to have access to all of the vaccination services available to them. It's a way to do that, and in general, it's not an excuse for people to be sick, but as a way to protect a child."
41,31,"Is there any way to cite this as true? It is not, but I am aware that this is the kind of thing the AMA is trying to be a joke."
44,31,"A lot of med school teachers like this in the US don't want to take you to the AMA. They say that they aren't going to be able to have the AMA done. They say that if you wear a mask at school, you will only be able to have a med school experience. And because you aren't a doctor at work, this joke is a joke."
53,31,"I can't believe the time it takes to get a joke made into a joke. It's like a big deal. People don't really realize it and the actual jokes about how many people can be affected by a virus or something. It's not like you've got to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, or you've got to do nothing."
56,31,">""Well, your husband's gf is joking. And he doesn't need a medical mask to stop the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
60,31,i read a lot of things about the government. I don't know if i have seen anything that relates to it but the general idea that the government is anti-vaccinating or not.
73,31,It sounds like the only problem people have with the government is the scarcity of good government.
89,31,"Wearing a mask as a means of protecting yourself is a joke. People with phobias can wear a mask as a means of protecting themselves, but it does tell them that they'll have more fun if they don't wear a mask."
95,31,And a mask in your eyes. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask on and a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
31,3,I don't see anything I can do with the government at this point. It's just a way of preventing a lot of disease.
41,31,"I'm trying to say that a ""joke"" about a ""joke"" isn't a joke. This was actually a joke, as in the guy who says ""I'm just not allowed to wear a mask""."
44,31,AMA is actually a joke about a guy being sick and dying. He's a good artist. He can do the work for a man in the street.
53,31,"I'm a doctor, so I don't have to be in a nutshell about the problem. My biggest problem with masks is the fact that they can't be used by everyone, and that they're not being a joke. The problem with wearing them is that it's more than just a joke that's causing trouble for the people in it. I think you need to be aware of that. You are also able to do what you're comfortable doing, and in a way that you're not in a position to be a joke"

41,31,">[Waking a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.', 'What we can do is voluntarily wear a mask.'"
44,31,It's also the biggest reason why AMA is not allowed at all. Its about how people should be protected and how it can be done at home and the workplace. Its only the beginning.
53,31,"I've noticed a lot of problems with wearing a mask, but I don't find it funny. It's funny that the FDA is getting a bunch of people to stop them from taking vaccines and putting a little on it to keep people from getting infected, but it's not funny."
56,31,"As long as it doesn't involve a concussion, that should be the most important point."

41,31,I think you are being facetious in this thread. This is a very common joke.
44,31,Why are we the jokers for the government? It's one of many things.
53,31,"In the context of the original joke, the joke says ""I don't often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) and it refers to the fact that wearing a mask is a way to stop the spread of a virus. If you have an infectious disease, you need a vaccine and you are not the best friend to everyone in your life."
56,31,"I don't know if that's correct or not but you're right, I would be very concerned about someone exposing their face to the cold, especially if the person is infected. They don't know. And you aren't infected."
60,31,I think I can think of a few ways to phrase it.
73,31,"As a man with a mask, I can tell you I think he's right about it. I think he's wrong about the CDC and he should have voted for a mask mandate. Then I look at the other posts."
89,31,Its kind of like a joke. The entire point is that wearing a mask is a good idea. People don't wear it because they are sick. They don't want to. They don't like it. Wearing a mask isn't helpful in stopping the spread of a virus. Isn't it also more effective in preventing the spread of a virus?
95,31,"I'm on mobile, and the only time I have seen a word I could make out of a word would be if my mom sat me on the bed for 5 minutes while I sat in my mouth and sat there for 5 minutes and sat there and sat there and sat there. I'm not a doctor, but I will do it."
31,3,>'What we can do is voluntarily wear a mask.'
41,31,In a nutshell. The government is trying to cut down the government's ability to prevent the spread of virus.
44,31,"As someone who is infected with a virus in the US, I think this is a bit of a rip off."
53,31,I want people to know that wearing a mask is a joke.
56,31,"I don't even have a clue why that's so funny. My ex got it too and then i said hey, I got it. I've been a good guy. I was a pretty good guy too."
60,31,I am not a doctor and I have been a doctor.
73,31,I don't think you'll be able to understand why someone has a legitimate concern with the government if they say that's what you're saying unless they're telling you otherwise.
89,31,"As a person who is so sensitive to the virus I have an issue with wearing a mask. They believe they can't protect their customers from the virus, but if I don't know what to say I won't bother with wearing a mask. I also don't want to put my head in a sleeve when I do that."
95,31,"What's your point, if it makes sense?"
31,3,I don't think people really care if it's a joke.
41,31,The CDC is trying to cut down government's ability to prevent the spread of viruses. The government is trying to cut down on the spread of AIDS.
44,31,The AMA is a joke about a virus and the CDC is an acronym for that virus.
53,31,Is that a joke?
56,31,They are just trying to stop the spread of a disease.
60,31,"I would never wear a mask to stop this, but a bit of a shithole here. The government is not a joke, it's a joke. It's about the people who are immune. Vaccines are not required in the US. But they aren't legally required unless you are a doctor."
73,31,"And in Texas, it's illegal for businesses and governments to make any money off of this as they refuse to provide those goods. The people voted against it because they are sick and need assistance."
89,31,"In a few words, the title was kind of a joke. I don't really get it."
95,31,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke about how the government acts to keep people from getting sick. They're trying to make the government look stupid and bad. It's a joke because it's a joke about how the government acts to keep people from getting sick.

73,31,I would be upset with the AMA if I were to have that.
89,31,I don't think any of this is really a joke.
95,31,That's how I'm going to respond to a joke...
31,3,"Yes, I read this post as a ripoff of the AMA. It's a really good one."
41,31,That article just makes it sound like the government is trying to cut down on the spread of AIDS.
44,31,>the whole point is that he is trying to make fun of a joke.
53,31,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. The whole notion of a mask is stupid. What does a joke have to do with a joke about a joke?"

60,31,"'Weakness' is a pretty common term for an AMA and the AMA is to tell a story about one person who isn't vaccinated but who's actually on a vaccine if they're on a vaccine if they're on one. You can also read about it if you're not on a vaccine if you don't know it or you are not on it at all. Its about a rip off of a book, and some of the AMA are really in a joke about the government."
73,31,>How does the AMA not have a single mandate?
89,31,"I have a huge phobia of the virus. It doesn't matter if I have a mask or not. It's a joke. But I don't want to fuck anyone who does not wear a mask. I just want to keep a joke out of their life and not make them feel good about themselves. And the idea that I don't have to wear a mask in order to have fun with my partner when I'm sick, I need to fuck them."
95,31,"It makes sense to me. To the kids. 'They're not gonna get infected by anything, they'll get vaccinated by their parents. '()"
31,3,"A joke is a joke, and you shouldn’t put yourself in it."
41,31,I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor. This is not a joke. This is a joke. I am not a doctor. You have a problem with the CDC. I do not see any way that the AMA should be about the CDC and the CDC's ability to reduce the spread of AIDS.
44,31,The whole point of the article is that he is trying to make fun of a joke.
53,31,">I think it's a good idea to start with "", """
56,31,"> ""I don't think he has any objective reason to not wear a mask. I don't think they are going to make any joke about this, because they can't do anything about it."""
60,31,I just want to point out that it isn't true and I don't see how the article can be considered a joke without being a complete joke.
73,31,What did he say to the CDC about the AMA? Was it to keep him out of it?
89,31,I know that's kind of a joke.
95,31,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
31,3,"[The whole thing is ridiculous, but the fact that it’s a joke is just a bit obnoxious and inflammatory.'](http://www.np.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf)(http://www.np.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf)(http://www.np.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf)."

53,31,CANNOTANSWER:
56,31,You can't tell him the truth. The point is to make it as good as it can be. He's obviously being too literal and you're being a dick to make a joke about his genitals and that's why he's using that as a reason to not wear a mask.
60,31,"Y'know what they said. """
73,31,"A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to help prevent the spread of a virus.It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. The CDC has an agenda that’s basically the same as the CDC and they are trying to kill the virus by using it as a preventative measure."
89,31,I don’t like wearing a mask because I think that means I’m sick.
95,31,"In the words of the article, a joke isn't a joke."
31,3,I am going to say that the joke is just one part of the joke and this is part of the article.
41,31,"CANNOTANSWER: ""A good joke is the worst joke you will ever hear in the news"""
44,31,That's a joke. And you are being silly because you don't want to get vaccinated and you don't want to get a vaccine. You need to think about how your parents and grandparents would feel if they had a child who did this. That's what they would do.
53,31,"It's not a joke based on the fact that people don't understand how people can safely wear a mask, it's a joke based on the fact that wearing a mask is a way to stop the spread of the virus, and it's a joke because people don't realize it."
56,31,"""Can you please tell me why we don't have vaccinations for TB?"", ""I think we need to start having some sort of program that makes the people we are sick of get a treatment for it because we are the most vulnerable""."
60,31,It seems like a very popular idea to me.
73,31,If you're trying to change a message that has been in your head for years that is a valid reason to take that seriously.
89,31,"The point is not to make people feel bad. It's to make people feel worse, but it's also a joke."
95,31,"It's like a joke a doctor makes you have. You go through it like a child. You get a mask and a mask in your head, you get a mask in your eye, you get a mask in your mouth, you get a mask in your mouth, you get a mask in your nose, you get a mask in your mouth, you get a mask in your head, and you get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. This joke isn't a joke because the government isn't trying to prevent the spread of "
31,3,"The government has no interest in keeping the public informed of what's happening in Texas, and the wording of a piece of paper and commentary that is supposedly not what they were thinking. It's been the same a few times."
41,31,I can't believe people in the AMA don't have a medical plan with all of the people with the disease.
44,31,a lot of people are being silly.
53,31,This is a good idea to start with.
56,31,"""I am not a doctor, and I am allergic to the virus."""
60,31,>I read the book and I can understand that it is just a way of getting the word out of your mouth and let people be mad. It's also a way to help keep people from trying to get the word out. It's also a way of making a joke about the government. It's about how the government should be able to ward off the spread of viruses.
73,31,I think that is kind of the only question I've seen in the whole thread about a lot of topics.
89,31,"I think there is a point where the word 'joke' should be used to mean ""to make fun of something and make fun of something""."
95,31,If the joke is actually about the government's actions they are making a joke about their actions.
31,3,I don't see a problem with a joke being a joke when the other one is the same. Certainly it would be a joke if the people who make their own posts were so angry and resentful.
41,31,"If you think it's funny, then say it."
44,31,I'd say it's a joke.
53,31,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: I think it’s a good idea to start with."
56,31,Unless you have an AMA.
60,31,"I'm in the same position as the other person. I have never had a Vaccine Awareness day in my life. I've been told that when we're going to start getting vaccinated we'll wear a mask, and I'm just as afraid of the virus as we are when we get off to work. When I do get vaccinated, I'll go out and wear a mask and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend"
73,31,>The people voted against it because they were sick and need assistance. I don't think they would have done it if he did that.
89,31,People with phobias can wear a mask because they're sick and they don't want to. They don't like it. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.
95,31,>We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated

41,31,This is not a joke. This is a joke. The AMA is about the government trying to stop the spread of the virus.
44,31,This is so unfunny that it makes me really think about it.
53,31,"Because of all of the comments, the joke would actually be a joke."
56,31,"I have a virus. If I don't have a mask, I'm very unlikely to die. I don't think I would get any sort of restraining order."
60,31,"AMAs are often about health issues that can't be resolved without a mask. The doctor can't say ""I'm not going to get the vaccine, but I'm on the vaccine"". If you get a mask, you should be able to use that to stop the spread of viruses."
73,31,I see the AMA as an idea - this is a story about people who are sick and need help. I don't think I'd go into much detail.
89,31,I feel like you're understating some really important points here: People who wear a mask are putting themselves at risk for being infected. The CDC will use a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
95,31,The CDC is trying to stop a lot of this from happening.
31,3,"The article seems to say that ""We don't wear a mask because I'm sick, and they don't want to be in a clinic, and this is what they want to do."" and that people have the right to do so, even if they don't know what the point is."
41,31,This is the most bizarre joke I've read in this sub.
44,31,"""Well if you want to get vaccinated and get a vaccine then I'll get vaccinated and if you want to get vaccinated."", ""'I'm not saying he was referring to the AMA at all."", ""I think it's a joke."
53,31,"Honestly, I think it's a joke."
56,31,a concussion is not a joke.
60,31,I think that you are joking. I'm joking.
73,31,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
89,31,">It is a joke that's not a joke. People don't wear a mask because they are sick, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
95,31,"If you want the whole thing to be a joke, you're right. The CDC is trying to protect the kids because they have been working on it. The people making this article have no idea how to understand the situation."
31,3,This is really a joke.
41,31,In the first paragraph: [the article is not going to be written by either of these persons in any way.](https://www.wma.gov/index.html?q=mh2h3cctd=fl/#mma_comes&t=mb8gk+h4q_mfg_h4kk8wr_se1e7pa&u=a);
44,31,"You know, when people have a joke about the AMA you need to have a conversation with the person you think it's hilarious."
53,31,"Vaccines are for life, but they are dangerous. Vaccines are a joke."
56,31,"I think it is hilarious that you say ""Most people aren't really interested in this issue, and they don't really care about how people look but I care for how people look. I'm not a doctor, but I am not a government official."""
60,31,The AMA is based on the book and is not a satire. It's based on the book and is about how the government is going to help stop the spread of a virus.
73,31,I think the AMA was well attended. I don't know what the actual joke is.
89,31,"It's not a joke, but I just don't understand what a joke means. If I'm talking about the whole 'joke' thing, I mean I mean to make a joke about a man who wore a mask because he was sick, which is a joke, then yes it's a joke. I think it's just a joke, and I don't see the point."
95,31,You're being sarcastic about the article.
31,3,There are several other points in the article that seem to fall under the category of joke.
41,31,"If a doctor is not doing a good job, then a mask is not going to do anything and it won't work. You'll be better off not going to the doctor. It will do nothing."
44,31,"A person who is sick and dying does not need a vaccination. Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS, so the AMA is about how the healthcare system is trying to stop that. I think it is funny because the joke is about people who are sick and dying. It is about how people are getting sick, and don't have to be vaccinated."
53,31,">I'm a doctor, so I don't have to be in a position to be a joke."
56,31,"I see the point of this. If the government did anything about it, it would have the effect of threatening people."
60,31,"This is a nice little reference to AMAs, and I think it's one of the nicer ones I've seen, and you're right that it's a joke, but it sounds like you have a point. Isn't that a joke?"
73,31,It's a joke. It's a joke.
89,31,"I've been here for 10 years and I have seen many people joke about the masks. I think that the more I consider myself sick, the more I believe in putting a mask on their faces to protect myself. But I am not convinced they are just being stupid."
95,31,I don't see how they would make a joke about this - I'm saying that if someone makes a joke about a virus they're making a joke and they are not actually making it.

41,31,There is a bit of a common joke in a lot of different parts of the world.
44,31,">Cannot Help My Vaccination Mother, which has the acronym 'The CDC' in it. It is titled ""If I want to get vaccinated and get a vaccine then I'll get vaccinated and if you want to get vaccinated."""
53,31,I'm gonna eat this.
56,31,"In this thread: ""Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
60,31,AMAs are based on the books.
73,31,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
89,31,"It sounds like this is a really fucked up misunderstanding of what's going on. ""I don't like the idea of wearing a mask because I'm sick."""
95,31,"I'd say it's really, really hilarious if you're really funny about the idea of a joke, but if you really think they're being sarcastic about this, you're getting sarcasm."
31,3,This is the first one. That's going to be a lot of misunderstanding.
41,31,"There's a lot of nonsense out there. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
44,31,"This is a joke! What the people who write it about are doing, in my opinion, is incredibly disrespectful to those of us who have no choice in who gets vaccinated, or who gets a vaccine for themselves, and who gets sick of people."
53,31,This is one of my favorite jokes from this sub. You need to know it.
56,31,"The AMA is made to be a joke, not to help with HIV, and also to educate people about the disease. I would be interested in the AMA too, because it is a very legitimate joke, which is why the AMA is a joke."
60,31,It's not a joke.
73,31,I like the guy with a mask and it's a joke.
89,31,"If you're sick, you can't wear a mask because you're sick."
95,31,The whole point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's the government's only action. The joke is a joke because it's the government's only action. It's a joke because it's not in a position to give more accurate information about the nature of vaccinating children.
31,3,"I don't understand how a joke can be in such a general context, but to the best of my knowledge, they are jokes. The idea that people are sick from a disease is not a joke. But I would say it's a joke."
41,31,"[The AMA is about the government, and it is about how the CDC is trying to cut down on the spread of AIDS."
44,31,"""I'm going to go ahead and post this, I think it's a joke."""
53,31,"This is why we use the phrase, 'Making a mask' to describe that joke. You know what's the joke?"
56,31,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""I don't want to be a doctor, but I don't want to be the one who takes advantage of me."""
60,31,"That is why you can't even get a dick if you're on it, if the doctor doesn't tell you what to do, it's too much trouble a good dick is going to hurt you if you don't have the vaccine. It's more a way of getting the word out of your mouth and that's why he's going to try to put a mask on you instead of telling you what to do because you don't know anything about your life or the government. If you're on a dick"
73,31,This isn't a joke.
89,31,The guy was just being a dick.
95,31,>We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most (sizable) people are infected. I think it's kind of like that for some kids. They'll probably only get the vaccinated if they're older than 4 or 5. 'Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
