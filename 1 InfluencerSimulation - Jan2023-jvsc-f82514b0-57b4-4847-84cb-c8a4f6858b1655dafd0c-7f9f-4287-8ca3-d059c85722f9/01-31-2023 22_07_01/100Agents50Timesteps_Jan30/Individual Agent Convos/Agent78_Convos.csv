78,7,You're missing the point.

78,17,"I have a friend who does this. She went on a run with a man she met on a job, she asked the man who had a job to dress in her top half a black leather shirt and a black scarf. The woman cried and said that she cried, but not her husband."

78,25,"When we were sick and had no real protection, we still used masks."
78,35,"You're the only person who wears a mask in your job, right? And assuming you work in a work place, you need to be vaccinated."
78,38,i went on a run in texas recently and i had never heard of this before. how did you know you had to wear a mask in this event?
78,39,I did the same thing. It was just so cold and not very pleasant. So it was a hard day.

78,76,"I had a mask on when i was a kid and it didn't help with the virus. Then i went on a work trip on a bus with my friends and went to see a friend. Then I stayed at a ritzy little hotel and walked into the pygmy pygmy pygmy park on my second flight. I knew it didn't help with the virus but I was too scared to get back from the bus, so i flew out to be a doctor to see a doctor"
87,78,OP is the first to respond to this post. You do not have to answer the question he asked. There is a reason the AMA is so successful:

78,25,"I'm a sycophologist, I think I see something that could make me want to take off a mask."
78,35,"I have a lot of stories about people that wear masks during work, too. There's a guy on the train wearing a mask on his girlfriend in front of her and then the police show up. He got the story because he felt the need to take a picture of him on the bus. He wanted a picture of the plane to be worn to show him he was on his way to school, so he walked off and got his mask. He kept the camera fixed up. There was another guy in the bus, and a lady who told him the story of what "
78,38,"I've been wearing a mask for a few years. I wore a mask once and was taken out of the hospital with a virus. It hurt like a fucking bat. I've never had an infection, but a few days ago a couple of people in my department thought my bf was going to throw it in a bucket and they had to take it off. I said he couldn't do that and said that I was going to wear it when he left and was able to make it out. They're trying to "
78,39,It's a kind of apologies to the person. Apparently wearing a mask is a way to prevent the spread of the virus. Basically to prevent other people from getting a virus that causes serious illness by being afraid of being sick.
78,41,"It is necessary to have a mask to wear, as a workday, so as not to be distracted, it helps to avoid a virus or illness, to prevent sickness, to save the lives, to stay alive. It's in place to keep a healthy body alive, but you're in it, so you'll need a mask to keep it alive, which is what you're doing."
78,43,I think wearing a mask is just a way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,49,In the words of OP:
78,53,I think you misunderstood the entire point of the AMA...
78,54,I went on a work trip for the first time a few years back and I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus. I wore a mask and when I got sick I stayed in a pygmy pygmy park.
78,58,I think the AMA is a little misleading.
78,59,This is what happened when the government wore a mask on a bus for a time.
78,60,"''Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."
78,65,"> People wear masks to stay in the habit, not to get sick. It's a good excuse for being too busy for it."
78,66,afk you should take a tour and see what happens if you want to try wearing a mask on a work trip.
78,67,People wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
78,76,Then a friend asked me to fuck my face for a second. Then she went on a run in Texas and we did the same thing. I had no idea what the fuck he had to wear. I did it because I wanted to.
87,78,"I've been in a medical crisis when I was young. We'd wear masks around our mouths as well. In fact, I have to take them out if I could and I have no reason to feel uncomfortable if I don't have any personal information."
88,78,"This is one of the ways to get a virus out of your body, even if it isn't gone, if you are taking it out. It's also a way to stop a virus from spreading."
89,78,I think it's important to remember to wear a mask. That will actually help with getting away from the virus and making it better for you.
93,78,The joke is that you know what you are doing and can not do it because you are being taken advantage of. That's what makes a good joke.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,"When I was a kid, it made me very nervous. I was a little scared that I would come down with a virus on my head because I was afraid of it and when I was sick, I was gonna be wearing a mask so I could get some rest. I was terrified that I might get sick. I took off my mask when I was sick and it really helped me a lot."
78,10,"Wearing a mask will help to keep your body healthy, and you'll save lives. This is how a virus will be spread."
78,17,"It's so important that people get off their feet and get a clean shave, which is the very idea that this is a good idea."
78,18,"He is a jerk and the government is a misogynistic asshole. You can't stop a virus in a hospital when you are going to be sick, you can stop it when you are sick, you can stop it if you don't know what it is, you can just stop it from spreading and go back to work."
78,25,In my experience the government needs to stop the spread of a virus in order to stop it from spreading.
78,35,"I think I read some of the links wrong. I was getting my first vaccination for HIV when I was 6 years old. I think it was part of the ""Wondering the spread of the virus."""
78,38,So you got sick and went to the hospital?
78,39,I don't know if they've been able to explain it to you or not. It's a big deal.
78,41,I have a feeling this is the kind of thing people don't realize until the very end. It's the type of thing where we're always looking for other people who can take their shit to the vet and then put a mask on them to a point where they're sick and can't get rid of it.
78,43,I wore a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
78,49,"I think the problem is that wearing a mask means you're not infected, you're attracted to the person."
78,53,"I don't think people should have a problem with a doctor that does this. I think everyone needs to see a doctor. If they don't see you or haven't seen you already, why are there people in the medical field and doctors that have to wear them? I don't get the point. There are people that wear a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
78,54,"I'm really confused as to why the AMA wasn't relevant. This isn't about the AMA, it's about if you want to read that."
78,58,"I've done something similar in life. I had a facial mask on that made me laugh, but the facial mask was not just for fear of getting sick, it was for the fear of losing a person. But I was putting it on when I had a problem and I did it just because I felt better about myself. I'm not a big fan of that, I don't like it."
78,59,"I'm just going to throw a fit and say something like, ""But this guy is on a bus, and I was wearing a mask"""
78,60,"I agree with the others here, but the whole idea of wearing a mask is just wrong."
78,65,"There is something you can do with your mask that won't let you in, like bringing it to a party with a mask on and the mask on. I've never had a sick or sick person in my life and I can relate to a bunch of people who wear masks at all times of the day, like the ones I used to go to the doctor or go on a drive and they'll tell you why. Basically, it's a way to get away from a symptom or an infection, and they can't keep up with it."
78,66,"I'd say there is a little misinformation. Specifically, ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus. Basically to prevent other people from getting a virus that causes serious illness by being afraid of being sick."
78,67,i can think of a lot of reasons why people should wear a mask and that's because they think people need to have a mask when going on a job or other. i wore a mask to keep the virus from spreading so i was able to be able to wear a mask at my job and not to get sick or have other bad things happen in the workdays to keep the virus from spreading. i wore a mask once and was taken out of the hospital with a virus.
78,76,My uncle had a skeptic and said his friend slammed on a mask after he got sick and wore it to keep him away from the virus.
87,78,"A very serious illness that hasn't been vaccinated, has not been properly cured, has not yet passed the medical stage requiring vaccination to occur. This is due to the fact that people will have to be vaccinated when they have been vaccinated to prevent a lifelong illness from occurring. This is due to the fact that people will have to be vaccinated when they have been vaccinated to prevent a lifelong illness from occurring."
88,78,"If I ran on the people saying they wore a mask, I would be pretty embarrassed. My friends would like to get out because they're infected with the virus. It doesn't make the dna any worse, especially not if you're a doctor. I'm not sure what you mean. I'm very concerned. I'd go with you."
89,78,I don't think anyone would disagree with this. It's just part of the measures deployed by the government that are being done to stop the spread of a virus.
93,78,>I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,Wearing a mask helps to prevent an infection but does not prevent it from spreading.
78,10,"The whole thing is not that I'm a fan of them but I do love the idea of them as part of their policy and its not just about being an asshole in an accident, it's a pretty cool idea."
78,17,I read this as 'I think people need to see a doctor.
78,18,I'm a doctor so I'm referring to the fact that I wear masks because I don't want to get sick and that it's very harmful for my health - I have a nose infection and I've been vaccinated for HIV/VHBs - and they are not the problem I'm looking for.
78,25,"I had to wear a mask to avoid infection. The part that made me want to be on the street was about trying to help people get better. My ex got me an erection and said, ""I need a mask, please don't give me an erection."""
78,35,"I have a bunch of stories about people who wear masks at all times of the day, like the ones I used to go to the doctor or go on a drive and they'll tell me why."
78,38,I'm not sure I'd be able to do it because of my age and I do not have an insurance doc who will work with me for this.
78,39,>Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus.
78,41,"People say you need to have a mask, even if it's just for fun."
78,43,"It's not a ""good idea"" or ""great idea."" It's just the idea of saying you're sick. You don't do anything wrong."
78,49,">I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,53,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
78,54,"... I think the question is, what if they didn't put a mask on for fear of spreading the virus?"
78,58,Then why did you wear a mask while on a bus?
78,59,">I'm not a big fan of that, I don't like it. I'm just going to throw a fit and say something like, ""But this guy is on a bus, and I was wearing a mask"""
78,60,>I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
78,65,"The idea of putting on a mask in public seems like a big, silly joke. I'd say people should see a doctor."
78,66,"It's not really a joke to me, and I think it's pretty ridiculous."
78,67,That is a really bad example of misinformation. I'm not sure how you could be able to be able to put a mask on people when they were sick or infected.
78,76,I think you are implying that people wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus and I think that you should just don't wear a mask.
87,78,Vaccines are for life. It's not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. It's not just a routine thing.

78,7,"People can wear masks, they can also help with the prevention of the spread of a new disease."
78,10,A bit of misinformation here:
78,17,It's all very wrong.
78,18,"I just read the title. It said something like, ""But this guy is on a bus, and I was wearing a mask."" It was really strange."
78,25,Wearing a mask helps to stop the spread of a virus.
78,35,That's not funny at all. It's really silly. It's just a joke.
78,38,It's a very dangerous and dangerous problem. I don't really know what the purpose of having a mask is or what you think it does.
78,39,I'm a bit tired from all of this. It sounds like you need to talk to a doctor to get your vaccinated.
78,41,It’s the type of thing where we’re always looking for other people who can take their shit to the vet and then put a mask on them to a point where they’re sick and can’t get rid of it.
78,43,"It is not a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke."
78,49,I feel bad for the man who was wearing a mask on his first flight in months.

88,78,"As an ex-female resident, I can confirm that they have had a serious outbreak with a virus in the past three years and that it's not the last one and a few days before the last one in the USA."
89,78,YES! The NSA has to do something. The government has to do something. He can't just put it on a'makeup' and have it go away. You gotta be smart and do it if you can't go.
93,78,It's not a joke. It's a joke that's funny because it's funny.

78,7,There's a lot going on in this thread here.

78,25,"The government is shit. This guy's not a doctor, and his friend is."
78,35,"I think it's funny because, if you get a new job, you can do something to help stop the spread of the virus."
78,38,There's only one thing that's really funny about them: The government's failure to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke and I think you need to take the time to read the comments.
78,39,"There's a big difference between wearing a mask for a reason, and a mask for preventing infection. In the US, only people with cancer, like those with AIDS, are allowed to wear a mask. You may not know what a mask is, but I guess that is just a standard medical device. A lot of doctors are able to get people vaccinated for diseases, but they're unlikely to be able to provide them with the proper vaccination - a mask to vaccinate them before they're needed - and it's an"

78,66,"I feel like we have a chance to be a bit jerk in this regard. It's time to start trying to understand your mind. If you ever need to be an expert on what's going on in a country like the United States, try going to the doctor or to the doctor to get a diagnosis or screening."
78,67,This is really not even a joke.
78,76,My husband had an outbreak of a flu when I was young. His uncle would go to the doctor and tell him that the guy needed to be vaccinated with vaccines. He felt like he had to wear a mask but that's about it.
87,78,I'd go on a medical mission. I want to get the kids vaccinated. I have a cold. I don't know if I can handle a vaccine but I don't feel safe while wearing a mask outside. I've had two kids. I have a very healthy mouth. I've been vaccinated before. I had a cold so I've been wearing masks and it was pretty uncomfortable if I didn't put on a mask. My OB says that vaccines can be used against the disease that's in their
88,78,I don't think anyone was able to take a joke from this one. I think it's a joke.

78,7,It sounds like they're taking a joke of a joke. If they're not. And I'm saying that it's a funny joke.
78,10,"The fact that the joke is actually hilarious is beyond me. You're being jaded. I feel like I am being harsh, but I feel like I am being kind of harsh."
78,17,I'm sorry to hear about this. I was diagnosed with an AIDS outbreak at 18 and the last imputation I found to have been on a swiss migrant caravan in the United States and i was not able to get the vaccine. I can't think of anyone who knew this.
78,18,"I'm just a joke fan, but I'd like to suggest that the government is the only country that actually uses vaccines for the purpose of stopping infectious diseases. The government is an asshole for not using it based on religious beliefs, and not the reason for it."

It's funny because 'A lot of people say ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."""
78,35,"Vaccines are a joke. In my experience, the problem with masks is that you have to use them when a person is in need of them. They help prevent any future infections. It's also very useful to give people more protection. I mean it's kinda hard, especially if your job requires you to wear a mask."
78,38,What is the point of having a mask when you're on a bus?
78,39,So people get vaccinated?
78,41,"A lot of people say that vaccines can stop the spread of the virus, but they're unlikely to be able to provide them with the proper vaccine."

78,49,"I think the problem is that wearing a mask means you're not infected, you're attracted to the person."
78,53,Is the government an organization? Not a government
78,54,I'm confused as to why the AMA wasn't relevant.

78,67,This is not even a joke.

87,78,Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
88,78,So you know what it is that a lot of people who have never had HIV have not been able to tell anyone that they were able to get them out of the situation. I guess there is a difference.
89,78,"I'm sorry, but if I am in the US and I don't wear a mask, I don't want to make it."

But he doesn’t know enough about the virus to go out of his way with a mask. I think he’s a joke"
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the virus. The whole idea is a joke.
78,53,"I was on the same plane. This is one of those trips where people have to go into a clinic, not to tell you to nip your hands."

78,67,This isn't even a joke.
78,76,I'm not a doctor but I work at a hospital and I do not wear a mask.
87,78,"The AMA is about protecting children. If you don't get vaccinated, you can't prevent the spread of a virus. Its about protecting the public. Whether or not you are a bad parent, it isn't a joke."

78,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,18,"It's pretty clear that the government does not want to take responsibility for any disease because people are infected. But if you’re not infected, it’s the government."
78,25,i think people are confused by this.
78,35,Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
78,38,I'm not sure it was a joke or a joke to you. I thought the one about the government's failure to prevent the spread of a virus was kinda stupid.
78,39,A lot of people with HIV are allowed to wear masks because they're good at what they're doing. A lot of people with AIDS aren't allowed to wear any kind of mask either. People should be able to go on a tour of the country or in other countries to find out what's happening with their children. A lot of people are just being selfish and stupid.
78,41,"I'm not a doctor but I do work at a hospital and I wear a mask, a black one would make me feel very uncomfortable."
78,43,"I don't know how that works, I've read it about 3 times and it doesn't seem like the same jokes."

78,38,"You think the idea that ""a man in a hat was a ripoff of the book?"" sounds cool. And I agree with you there, you would have a great time with your kids if you knew your bf was going to throw it in a bucket to get out and he didn't. I feel bad for him and his wife for not knowing how to do that."
78,39,"Well, this subreddit is kind of a ripoff of the book, so I'm not sure if it's a joke, but in the comments people in the sub agree that putting a mask on is necessary and a joke in itself is not necessarily inappropriate.

78,66,I think I read the article.

78,18,It's a joke. It's a joke.
78,25,CANNOTANSWER: The headline is funny.
78,35,"So I wear my mask when I get sick if I can't take the bus. Then I have to wait and see if someone does it, in order to get the vaccine."
78,38,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
78,39,I'm pretty sure the actual joke is about the people who think people should wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
78,41,"Wearing a mask can only make a small difference to the ability to keep a healthy body alive. It doesn't actually prevent a virus, it prevents a health condition."
78,43,I don't know about that. I just think it's funny. I don't think people are actually that good at explaining things they don't know.
78,49,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
78,53,What the fuck. Is it the CIA or some other organisation that runs the government?
78,54,"i don't know, but they don't want to know what it means to be sick"
78,58,Is there a reason not to wear a mask when you have an infectious disease?
78,59,"I am trying to find a way to make people who do not wear a mask wear their own masks instead. The person who is being referred to as the ""senior"" of this subreddit isn't a scientist. Rather, he is referring to people who use the phrase ""senior"" as a term. People who use the term ""senior"" are referred to as ""senior"" people."
78,60,"You know, I'm not a doctor but I just did a job at a hospital when the virus was discovered and the company didn't even know how to use it."
78,65,"I'm a doctor, so I know this, but if the main reason for me to wear a mask is to protect my job and the public, I'm going to be all jaded and silly."
78,66,I think you are missing the point of this subreddit. The CIA is a group.
78,67,"[Hey, I feel like I blew my mind a little bit on this topic today!](http://np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf)"
78,76,I would like to add that you need to look up to how you can prevent the spread of a disease without looking down at any actual evidence. It sounds like a simple joke and not a joke.
87,78,I feel like this is kind of a good joke.
88,78,"I think this is the worst example of a joke. I don't think it's funny to call this a joke, it's the worst example of a joke."
89,78,"I can't imagine going to work with a mask without a mask. I'd wear one, I'd do it! You're not allowed to wear a mask, it's not that they don't know what's going on."
93,78,"I know some people who love a good joke, but this is how I see the movie."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,"I wore a mask when I was sick. It was like I was fucking with a virus, but I couldn't see a difference."
78,10,"No, but I still thought it was funny. I was surprised the CIA knew that there was a virus in the US and that we had the healthiest possible way to prevent it. I didn't want to take the bus, but I was sick so I decided to wear a mask and then go to the doctor. So I was sat down and told that there was no danger of getting sick. I didn't even have any ideas. And I was all over the place to ask for help. I was always told to change it, but I knew there was a problem with the virus"
78,17,"If the CDC sacked the CDC and the CDC put a red line on it, it would not be a joke at all."
78,18,"In this case, the CIA has nothing to do with the fact that people aren't allowed to wear a mask to protect themselves. It's just that the government has no ability to do it because it is a narcissistic, religious organization that is going to abuse everyone's right to do it."
78,25,I just want to say that you have a really tough job and it's a good idea. That's a good thing. It's a shame you're making a bad decision.
78,35,Yes. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
78,38,I have to say that I am very interested in the fact that the CDC is trying to make sure there are actually vaccines on the market. I am wondering how that works.
78,39,"If that's the case, I'd be interested. But, it's a joke."
78,41,"Wearing a mask to protect your job and the public is a joke. There's no actual evidence to suggest that they do not have the ability to save or maintain the disease, and a lot of people in the US just don't know it. So what is the problem?"
78,43,You don't need a mask to protect your health.
78,49,"Basically, the whole point of wearing a mask is to stop the spread of a virus."
78,53,The movie is very funny. I'm sorry to say it's too long but it's very funny. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
78,54,"> I think it's inappropriate. I mean, people don't inevitably get vaccinated, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't like it. Vaccines are for life."
78,58,You have a question. How many people do you know who are a part of the CIA? I don't know the specifics.
78,59,"I think the joke is that it makes a lot of sense to be asked to wear a mask when sick, because if it's just a routine thing to do, it's a joke. And that the CDC should also tell people what the CDC is up to in terms of how to make vaccines."
78,60,Wearing a mask prevents the spread of the virus and prevents a number of illnesses. So you don't wear a mask when you are sick? You can't expect it to do it because it isn't effective.
78,65,"It doesn't sound like a joke, it sounds like a silly joke, but people should be aware that what they are doing is putting masks on, because that will prevent a virus and if people don't like the joke it would be a joke."
78,66,I can't help but laugh at the CIA and all the other shit they've gotten themselves into.
78,67,Is this a joke or something?
78,76,"I'm not a doctor, but I work for a doctor's office. This sub is not about the CIA."
87,78,You can go to the doctors in the US for a vaccine - for a very very short time. You can still find your doctor.
88,78,This is a terrible joke.
89,78,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The CDC doesn't know what's going on. It can't stop people from spreading a virus, unless they're wearing a mask."
93,78,"They both sound like ripoffs, they don't even exist. They're based on the book."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,"I know that ""I'm a doctor. I know that a mask's an amazing way to stop a virus"" and ""I can't help but laugh at the CDC."""
78,10,Vaccines are for life.
78,17,"> It makes a lot of sense to be asked to wear a mask when sick, because if it's just a routine thing to do, it's a joke."
78,18,Vaccines are for life.
78,25,"""That's a good idea."""
78,35,"It makes me so mad, because I would wear a mask as I was being asked to wear it when I get sick, but I would never eat it."
78,38,"I'm a medical student. I'm a pediatrician, so I'm not familiar with any of this stuff. I'm not sure that it's funny, but it's a joke."
78,39,">I'm pretty sure the actual joke is about the people who think people should wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."", ""I think it's inappropriate. I mean, people don't inevitably get vaccinated, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't like it."
78,41,The CIA is trying to protect people from this.
78,43,There's no actual evidence to suggest that the CDC does not have the ability to save or maintain the spread of a virus.
78,49,">I think it's inappropriate. I mean, people don't inevitably get vaccinated, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't like it. Is this a joke or something?"
78,53,They need to be more careful. The CDC is not able to stop the spread of viruses unless there is some government regulation to do so.
78,54,"Wearing a mask means you're not infected, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't like it. Vaccines are for life."
78,58,I think you are making a joke for a reason.
78,59,I'm not a big fan of it. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life.
78,60,It's funny. I feel like I am being kind of harsh. I feel like I am being kind of harsh. I feel like I am being kind of harsh.
78,65,"I don't think it's funny, I think it's inappropriate. But the joke doesn't sound funny. Vaccines are for life, you've got to wear one. I think the whole point of wearing a mask to protect your job is, to stop the spread of a virus. It doesn't sound like a joke, but it's inappropriate."
78,66,I don't know where you are.
78,67,"I thought the CIA would be a joke for a second. If I were you I'd know why they would ain't going to test me on vaccines. If I was going to test someone, but I still didn't, I wouldn't want to."
78,76,"I have never worn a mask, but I know my colleagues who do. There are many people I know who wear a mask because they feel that they aren't going to be vaccinated for anything."
87,78,"I'm very sorry this is such a weird subreddit, but I am a person who's had a lot of experience with the AMA."
88,78,Is there some other kind of vaccine that isn't a joke?
89,78,"The name of the thing you were referring to is the same thing as a joke, but with some ambiguity."
93,78,"""The Man in the Hat"" was written by an older man who wears a mask for a reason:"
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,"I hated the CDC, but they were not in a hazy position because they couldn't have done it without a mask. And they were in a dangerous position because of it."
78,10,I think there are other ways to prevent a virus.
78,17,It is a joke and I have no idea why people get so mad for it.
78,18,Vaccines are for life. But there is no other reason to prevent people from getting vaccinated if they are not infected. They are a joke.
78,25,"I was a sycophologist at a hs in the 60s. I had a very bad rash, and I was putting on a mask and I'm now sick. My doctor had me vaccinated for a few weeks. I wasn't sure what to say, but I didn't get sick or anything. It's actually not very bad, but I would always want to wear a mask when I got sick. The government isn't just trying to stop smearless, because it could stop the spread of a"
78,35,"I’m not joking, just saying that people do not understand how people should feel and how we should think about what happens when someone needs them, so they wear a mask when they are sick and not get vaccinated."
78,38,"I had to wear a mask for a few months a year. I was in the hospital a couple of times and I always felt like I didn't have a choice. It was only because of the virus that grew on the surface of the air, and I had to go to the hospital and be vaccinated for the rest of my life. I went back to a hospital after being sick, but it was in my memory."
78,39,I have never wore a mask. I'm very sick and can't think of a good reason not to get vaccinated.
78,41,People in the US don't know. A lot of people don't. The CIA is trying to protect people from this.
78,43,"It's pretty clear that it's not exactly a joke, that's for sure. The CDC is trying to try and prevent the spread of a virus. It's being talked about at length."
78,49,"I'm sorry to tell you that, though the phrase is ""I think it's funny, but it's inappropriate. I think it's inappropriate. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life."""
78,53,I'm in the doc field.
78,54,"I think that's the best part. I think a lot of people are just going to be more cautious, but there are a lot of people who are really outraged at the CIA."
78,58,"This has all been written in the context of the AMA. I think the AMA is a little misleading. I think there is some sort of 'I'm not a big fan of that', but I'm not familiar with any of this stuff. I'm not sure that it's funny, but it's a joke."
78,59,>I think it's inappropriate.
78,60,I don't like the 'I think it's funny' and I'm a little frustrated.
78,65,"I think I'm just being a bit harsh because the only one who feels the need to be able to actually respond is ""I think it's funny, but I think it's inappropriate."""
78,66,"This is what's going on in the AMA. The title should be more like, ""I feel like we have a chance to be a bit jerk in this regard. It's time to start trying to understand your mind."""

78,76,"I don't think you're being harsh, but your point is valid."
87,78,"So if you want to keep your kids safe if your doctors don't vaccinate you, you have to wear a mask?"
88,78,I have a medical mask that doesn't stop me from feeling that way about this virus a lot of the time.
89,78,"'It's not a joke. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. So you're saying people don't have to wear a mask because they're sick?

Almost as if everyone is the same emo. The same thing is going on in the AMA because I think the AMA is misleading."
78,17,"This is about what makes it inappropriate and cynical. If you feel like the title is funny, then you aren't being rude."
78,18,"Vaccines are for life, if you don't know."
78,25,">I'm not a doctor, but I work in a hospital and I would go to the doctor to see if anyone was interested in the situation. Vaccines are for life."

78,38,"I think that people would be more upset than they are. They might get pissed, but it's a real problem."
78,39,I'm so tired from this. It's in my memory.
78,41,I don't think the CIA is trying to protect people from the CDC.
78,43,"The problem with the AMA is that they are trying to minimize the spread of the virus. It’s not funny or good idea, it is just a joke."
78,49,"No. I think the joke is inconsequential. I think the joke is so that everyone who thinks of it like this is right and not just the person who says ""I think it's funny but it's inappropriate. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life."""
78,53,"""I think it's funny but it's inappropriate. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life."""
78,54,"This subreddit has a few points, it’s very informative and useful, and it’s easy to understand how people feel about it. I think it’s fair to say that most people wouldn’t if you asked for a pygmy pygmy pygmy or something – it just seems silly to ignore that."
78,58,"It's funny because it's an ineffective way to vaccinate and it's uncalled for in the US. But unless it's really that bad that it's okay to not wear a mask, or I'm just putting on a mask, I'm not going to say the wrong thing."
78,59,"I'm still not sure how to figure this out, but I'm still not sure it's inappropriate. It doesn't make sense that they're trying to ""prevent the spread of a virus"" or that they're trying to discourage people from vaccinating their child. It's pretty clear that it's not a joke. It's just that it's being talked about at length."

78,58,AIDS is a really scary disease. Its a really frightening disease.
78,59,A lot of people - from parents who aren't going to wear masks and don't understand the difference between wearing a mask and a hat - are referring to people who wear a mask for various reasons.
78,60,"I was born in the 60s and was very ill and had no medical advice, so it's probably just a little funny to read the title."
78,65,"A person who was sick and now knows no one in the world, is going to get sick with a medical mask when they say that. It's an unheard of fact that we're all suffering from a serious disease. It's a great movie, and the article is great, but a lot of people get sick of the thing."
78,66,"I had this issue with a doctor at work who did a lot of AMAs with medical professionals about people wearing masks when sick, with her pointing out the difference between a man with AIDS who went to the doctor and a man with AIDS who went to the doctor. My colleagues agreed to that they should go to a doctor to get a diagnosis or screening, which is the whole point. I'm glad my colleagues are not trying to get that."
78,67,The ad is very good in the past - but I've seen some awful people talk about it again.
78,76,''Took my first flight in months for a work trip everyone wore a mask everybody was respectful of other people reminds you not all people suck most but not all''
87,78,The government is trying to prevent this.
88,78,I think it's a joke. That a lot of people have no idea about the disease. But it's not about the AIDS. It's about the vaccine.
89,78,"The point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus, it’s useless and I hate it."
93,78,This is one of those things where the article and the article don't have a very good relationship.

78,17,"It makes a lot of sense to be asked to wear a mask when sick, because if it's just a routine thing to do, it's a joke."
78,18,There are more effective vaccines than just just being a patient - a bunch of people who get a lot of sick from masks.
78,25,AMAs are a form of media and have no value.
78,35,The one time the woman told me she was getting sick of the AIDS I thought she was wearing a mask because it makes the whole thing look silly and unprofessional. She mumbled about this to me and she didn't know the difference.
78,38,That's a really good line. You're being very naive.
78,39,I'd say it's a joke.
78,41,AMAs are always a joke. You are not a doctor. You need to have a mask and a hat. This is what the CDC is trying to protect people from. You don't understand what the CIA is trying to prevent.
78,43,"So, what exactly is your job?"

78,49,I feel like the joke is inconsequential. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life.
78,53,"It seems to me that wearing a mask would be a joke. The point of the AMA is that people have to put on masks. It's not a joke, because the people on the plane didn't do it to protect the people who wear them."

78,41,AMA is a terrible joke and an AMA is hilarious. You're the only one who 'feels bad' about it. People just need to figure out how to express their displeasure with this joke. They have the right to say that but people don't understand the whole point of it.
78,43,"The joke's all about the doctor (as in the doctor isn't necessarily the doctor) but it seems to be about someone who doesn't know how to use the hat or whatever masks he can buy and is still using them, or just thinks it's a joke."

78,58,I'm a doctor who wore masks in my work. That's something that my father said during the AMA.
78,59,It sounds like it could be the CDC telling a guy on a bus that it was wearing a mask.
78,60,The first part was just the same. I'm an American. It's a joke. You don't have to say you're funny. But your way of putting it is hilarious.

78,18,I didn't read the original book so I just assumed it was a ripoff of the book. I do realize that the actual quote was from a young journalist.

78,38,Why are there so many people on here complaining about the CDC?
78,39,"I don't think there is a joke here that I would take it as a joke as there is a joke. The AMA and AMAs are both blatantly unprofessional, but they're a joke. If the AMA is a joke, the AMA is a joke. They're not really a joke. There is a huge difference between a joke and a 'joke'."
78,41,A lot of people do not understand how it is a joke and a joke. This is a joke. This is the joke. The joke's all about the doctor (as in the doctor isn't necessarily the doctor) but it seems to be about someone who doesn't know what it means to be sick. It's a joke.

78,59,I think a little of what the title says might have a more literal meaning than this AMA.
78,60,"I'm really sorry that this is going to get downvoted - but it does sound like it's been used extensively in media about this sort of thing, so I'm gonna put in a little to show some context."
78,65,It's kind of a joke. People who have said this are really the only ones who can 'feel bad' about it.
78,66,It's about the CDC.
78,67,>Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
78,76,It’s a joke based on a book.

89,78,"It sounds like a joke that isn't really intended to be a joke, just an idiocy of the term joke."
93,78,"I would never be able to write a joke. I can't figure out why people say I love the book, but it's hard to think about it."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,I don't see a problem with a mask because it does prevent your blood from going to the bloodstream. It does protect you from the virus (which is the disease itself).
78,10,That’s exactly the kind of joke that is going on in a AMA.
78,17,"People are being so mad about it. I'd feel cheated and disinterested in trying to explain to them, why the government should be concerned with preventing the spread of a virus."
78,18,"I don't care what religions youre in, I'm just going to say that you're a joke fan, but I also don't care what youre doing, so I'm going to add my own to the list. I'm not saying the government isn't doing it based on religious beliefs, but there is no other reason for using it based on religious beliefs, so I would be worried about the whole thing."

78,38,"I am going to get my head back in order on the next time someone mentions ""a man in a hat."" because that's pretty much a joke for me and I don't have a clue what it means or how it is made. And I've sworn I had a hat. This is the best joke I've read and I don't care what it is."
78,39,It's a joke based on a book. It's a ripoff of a book.

78,18,I’m not sure I’m going to agree with everyone in this thread. I’m just saying this: people are stupid for not being the one to say or believe that the government is wrong. If the government does not use the CDC as the only solution they have to prevent the spread of a disease.

78,39,I thought you said that you were joking and that the AMA was a joke about the CIA. That makes sense.
78,41,"I was on a flight for 10 days when it started to rain. I didn't see a person in my line of work with an axe, so I had to go to the vet a little bit earlier to get the axe. So while it was a joke I went to the CDC, and they're trying to prevent people from getting sick, it seems that it was not a joke."
78,43,"I think the question is if it's a joke or is it about the people who are supposedly being paid to do it. I am not sure if that's a joke or not. I think it's a joke, even if it's a joke, and I think it's very funny to tell people you don't think you've done any wrong."

78,7,"I've never really known a single doctor who's a dr, but it's clear to me that a mask isn't a joke."
78,10,"“ I do love the idea of them as part of their policy and its not just about being an asshole in an accident, it’s a pretty cool idea.”"
78,17,I think that this book is a good example of why people need to use the NHS and the health services to prevent infection. It's an article from a very interesting source:
78,18,"This is just a rip off of the book, but it's a joke."
78,25,"The author was pointing out that the AMA was intended to prevent people from spreading AIDS, but is essentially trying to make a joke about it."
78,35,I'm not an expert in a field but I don't know enough about the current political climate and how that makes people crazy.
78,38,"It's a joke. I'm just joking. It's a joke, a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke."
78,39,"People who wear masks ARE putting on a virulent disease. This is a joke, I think. I am going to take my AMA to heart and tell you it is very nice, but it's not a joke and it's not a joke."
78,41,That's just what is being told in the movie
78,43,It is a joke because the CDC hasn't had a successful fight against it. It is a joke because it is about people who can't protect themselves from infections.
78,49,Vaccines are for life. The whole idea is a joke.
78,53,I think the joke is 'Why are people joking? ''It's funny but it's inappropriate. The whole idea of wearing a mask is not a joke.
78,54,"I'm very sorry that this subreddit gets blown away, but the most obvious thing I've ever read about the CIA in the past 3 years is that they would not have ever listened to the headline because they had no idea what their purpose was. It's not really the joke but that's the kind of joke that makes it so hilarious."
78,58,I have the CIA in my life. The AMA is for the sake of this sub.
78,59,That’s not a joke.
78,60,I think the guy on the top is trying to put a piece of shit into a pun. Those people are making a stupid joke about this because people think they are being clever and clever.
78,65,So what I'm saying is that the person he asked you to be vaccinated for the vaccines and the time to wear a mask is that you would want to make sure you're in an acceptable position for your family? I mean I'm a doctor. But that is why you should not wear a mask. I'm a doctor.
78,66,"As I said before, people wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. This isn't a joke. It's just a joke."
78,67,"> The whole point of the joke is that it's a bad idea. People don't wear a mask because they are sick, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to."
78,76,Then I woke up after eating a meal. It was a prank that wasn't funny at all.
87,78,"'It's about protecting the public, but it's about protecting the public. I'm not a joke."
88,78,I just read the title and thought it sounded pretty funny. But I think it's the best joke here.

93,78,"They are also ripoffs of the book - the book was not a ripoff, just a ripoff."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,I think that the CDC is just trying to get attention because of the ridiculousness of it. The guy who asked me to wear a mask when I was sick is trying to make a ripoff for that joke.
78,10,The people who wear a mask are a joke. They are a joke.
78,17,"So what's the issue here? This is not about a joke, it's about the idea of preventing the spread of a virus."
78,18,"I thought the title was an interesting joke. The title was funny as well as funny, but it's still funny."
78,25,"As a doctor, I find it hard to get the point across to the public that they don't know what they're referring to. The article I quoted was actually really informative and the title of the article was just an attempt to draw attention to a point that's a joke."
78,35,"I'm going to go with the idea that we should all be more vigilant about this disease than we should be protecting the world from it. It's a joke because if we were all smart and did a good job of doing that, people would think it was hilarious."

78,67,I can't make it out of the story that you said but I know that I'm going to have to do this.
78,76,I have been going on the internet all day. This is one of those stories that I can't recall reading. I just think it's a pretty silly and ridiculous joke.

78,10,It's a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. But it's not the kind of joke that can be interpreted as a joke.
78,17,"That's a great question, it really nailed the book down. I think that this was the first thing the book came up with. The author made the effort to keep this topic a real one."

78,65,"The point of the book is to stop the spread of the virus. If you're a doctor, then it's your job to protect the public from the CDC."

78,76,So... are you sure the CDC isn't ripping off a book that says what it is about?
87,78,AMA is an attempt to prevent the spread of vaccines. It's the main idea. It's a blatant lie. It's a joke.
88,78,You are in the right to be embarrassed. It is not a joke.
89,78,There's a point in claiming to make a joke about a disease. The whole point of the joke is that the problem is that the people who want to prevent it and it is not to do that are going to go. People want to fight it.
93,78,A ripoff of a book is something that isn't a book.

78,17,"A couple of references: ""Hey he's the one who told me this book was a joke,"" ""I read it as ""Adult Doctor and I will wear a mask whenever I feel sick"" (""Failure to wear a mask if you have to wear a mask, and to avoid the infection/virus/contamination"") ""Hey, my friend, I'm sick of the story."""
78,18,I feel like the title of the post explains why this book was a joke.
78,25,I'm a sycophologist who wears a mask when I'm sick.
78,35,"The story is just a remark. You are describing the actual story of the joke itself, in one sentence: ""Making it look silly and unprofessional is something we are told to do to stop AIDS. If I was a doctor I would wear a mask every time I get sick and I would never have the chance of getting the AIDS vaccine."" ""It makes me so mad because I would wear a mask as I was being asked to wear it when I get sick and they'll tell me why."""
78,38,"I'm not a doctor, but I think people want a story like this."
78,39,[http://www.amazon.com/media/opinions/sno-comment-of-the-women-amazon.html](http://www.amazon.com/media/opinions/sno-comment-of-the-women-amazon.html) is a pretty comprehensive overview of what this subreddit is about.
78,41,I'm an epidemiologist and I'm a dr. but I don't have a mask and I don't know how to make a joke. I'm just saying that I don't think it's a joke at all.
78,43,I know that people are joking a little but I think they are saying it's a joke. But they're also talking about how they didn't see that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV if it wasn't actually a joke. It's a joke because it's based on a book.
78,49,"""The whole idea is a joke. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life."""
78,53,Is the government an organization? Not a government.
78,54,"In all honesty, this isn't a joke, because it isn't a joke, it's a joke."
78,58,"There is a joke that it's not a joke and that it's a joke, a joke. You aren't a doctor but you are a doctor."
78,59,"So, you're saying I think the guy was putting on a mask for a time."
78,60,The story was very clear and it is about saving lives. Vaccines are for life - I'm a doctor and I don't think that's the point of the article.
78,65,"It's a joke because people don't wear them, and not because they're putting a mask on."
78,66,AMA is based on the book The AMA is about how to prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic
78,67,That's very... not funny.
78,76,"I don't have a problem with the people who say ""you don't need to be vaccinated"""
87,78,"I read it and I am very confused and am not sure how it works, and I just read the comment itself."
88,78,"In all seriousness, this sub hasn't been around long enough."
89,78,[Note: The CDC's job is not to stop the spread of a virus.''
93,78,CANNOTANSWER:
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,The idea of a joke is pretty common here.
78,10,AMAs. AMAs are all jokes. AMAs are a joke. AMAs are a joke. AMAs are a joke.
78,17,It's a joke because the author isn't being cynical about what's being put on a mask for life.
78,18,I don't really get why you're upset about this.
78,25,"I've always wanted to be a sycophologist in the UK and I know that is just as true as the jokes in the book, especially in the US. Mostly because I'm a dr. but I think the people here are making a bad decision in this way. I mean, they don't have to know what they want. I don't mean to be a joke about a joke. I mean, that's how I see it but it's just a joke, and I think the jokes and comments from people like this"
78,35,That's an interesting fact.
78,38,People have made this sub seem like a really'serious' thing. They are probably just trying to sell a shit load of shit.
78,39,A lot of people with HIV are allowed to wear masks.
78,41,"i have never even seen a joke where people don't understand what the joke is about. they're just saying that I'm not a doctor and I don't know how to make a joke. I'm just saying that I'm not a doctor, and I don't understand why it's a joke. There's no reason to tell a joke because the government is trying to protect people."
78,43,>You aren't a doctor but I am a doctor.
78,49,It's a joke.
78,53,"So, you like being in the doc field, or is it that you really like the movie?"
78,54,"I think the entire point of a AMA is to talk about the 'what's wrong with the AIDS virus?' thing, not what the AMA is about. It's a joke."
78,58,"The whole point of the joke is that it's a joke. People don't wear a mask because they're sick, they don't want to. They don't like it."
78,59,> It's pretty clear that it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's based on a book. The whole idea is a joke.
78,60,Why is a person wearing a mask about the disease? Is it because they have no way of knowing if they want to go to a doctor? Do you know why they would bother putting a mask on because of the AIDS?
78,65,"> (I am not a doctor, so I know this, but if the main reason for me to wear a mask is to protect my job and the public, I'm going to wear a hat to protect my job and the public)."
78,66,I think the most recent AMA is about “I think you are a funny guy”
78,67,This isn't a joke. It's a joke about a joke about a joke. That joke is just a joke. The CDC's job is to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic. It's a joke because it's based on a book.
78,76,"I mean, they jumped to the same conclusion. We are going to have to start a medical emergency and take steps to prevent this. We need to make it to the end of the patient, and we will continue to help this patient. If we start bringing the disease up again then we can make sure it's at least a good idea."
87,78,"There's no reason to avoid the joke, not just to protect the child. It's a joke. 'This is about protecting the public. But if you don't get vaccinated, you can't prevent the spread of a virus. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public. It's about protecting the public."
88,78,"AIDS is serious, and not a joke, just an illness affecting all people. It's very dangerous, deadly, and it is a huge risk for all people."
89,78,"If you want to be funny, please read the title and take note of the sentence. If you don't like the title, you don't get the word 'joke'."
93,78,If you are being sarcastic you should be ashamed that the author wrote the book.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,That's one of those things that people get stuck in a long list of reasons that are hard to understand.
78,10,"I would still be at my work, so I decided to get a mask and a doctor to be able to help me, because it helps prevent all that shit, and because that is one of the few times I've seen a joke that was good enough."
78,17,"I've read this book and know it's been put on a tumblr, but I also didn't see the reference to AIDS in the title."
78,18,"A lot of people with AIDS are allowed to wear a mask, because that makes them sick. But they aren't being treated like they aren't. So it's very clear that the government is wrong."
78,25,The joke that a doctor says is a joke about how doctors can't take a joke for granted that they are the only doctor that can give a joke about HIV.
78,35,"This is an interesting topic that may help the community - not to be confused with ""I'm not a doctor,"" as in I know I'm not a doctor but I have read the entire book and know about AIDS. It's kind of like the title says:"
78,38,I'm just talking about a joke.
78,39,"As I understand it, these things are a joke and an AMA are a joke."
78,41,"People can get on a plane and then wear a mask to get sick, but it's a joke."
78,43,"It's a joke. It is a joke. The government has a big problem, not the CDC."
78,49,"So, a lot of people who wear a mask at work have no problem with not getting vaccinated and aren't prepared to fight a virus and not have a medical job at home? I don't know why."
78,53,The government has no right to do anything without a license.
78,54,There are so many examples of 'pranks' on this sub. I can't wait to see what you get from it.
78,58,"> 'I feel like you are making a great point, as well. Vaccines are for life.'"
78,59,[A lot of people said Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus.
78,60,I don't think it's a joke. I think it's a joke.
78,65,CANNOTANSWER IANAL
78,66,Vaccines are for life.
78,67,"I believe a joke is an idea that can prevent and spread infectious disease. I would also not wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, which is the purpose of a joke. It's not a joke and it's not a good idea."
78,76,I think that they are a joke in a similar manner.
87,78,AMA's don't have rules or regulations.
88,78,"Yes, it is a joke. And it is illegal to put a mask on a person's body if they are already infected, but it is also illegal to have a mask on a person who is already infected. It is a joke because people are uncomfortable with the idea of a medical mask. It is illegal to put a mask on a person if they are not already infected."
89,78,"""It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."""
93,78,I think this is the first one of those situations that people are actually trying to get a laugh out of. If you’re going to start a new life with the shit out of the book. I’m gonna start going to try to laugh at this before I stop feeling cheated on.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,"i have had many problems with the CDC being too far fetched. and they haven't been in the wrong. the AMA has done some serious damage, but they haven't been as opportunistic as the AMA. I'm sorry to tell you that."
78,10,I had to read that a lot. So much of my post was about people pranking on the government and people who knew what they were doing. It made me realize that this is a joke. I'm really glad they stopped putting up with it.
78,17,"I think that when someone asks you to wear a mask, they're being cynical and making a joke. 'A lot of people said Wearing a mask at work can stop the spread of the virus."
78,18,"The CDC is a narcissistic, religious organization that is going to abuse everyone's right to do something. That's a great way to handle the situation - if there's any reason for that, you can simply tell the rest of us that this has nothing to do with the government's actions, a government is not going to use a CDC... a government is going to abuse everyone's right to do something."
78,25,"As a sycophologist, it is pretty obvious that the word ""masked"" is wrong. In the UK, it's called ""masked"", or ""invisible"", which is like ""hidden"" in a comic book or book."
78,35,"Then, at the end of the day, you can say ""Never say "". That's just a joke. And a prank."" What's more, if not more, you get a laugh out of this."
78,38,Vaccines are for life.
78,39,The whole AMA thing makes me so frustrated and scared that I can't afford to go to a doctor's office to get a vaccine and not be able to understand anything about it. Its so hard to make a joke that is ridiculous and a joke that makes the joke feel like it's an actual joke.
78,41,So what's the joke?
78,43,"I think the entire book is a joke, and is not the best one."
78,49,"""Waring a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,53,"Is the CDC a joke? If so, I think it is. I would be a bit embarrassed if someone referred to me as an infected person with AIDS."
78,54,"The AMA was not relevant, but the AMA is about the problem of a virus. Vaccines are for life. They are not necessary to stop the spread of AIDS."
78,58,"I think a good example of that is the way he describes the AMA in the AMA : ""We are taking the idea of vaccination seriously. The government has no right to do anything without a license. So, a lot of people say Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus."""
78,59,Is he talking about how this article is in reference to a book by John F. Kennedy?
78,60,"Vaccines are for life, but it's a joke. The guy in the book is basically calling it ""Muscles,"" and there's an interesting thing going on there."
78,65,"The way the movie is going. It's a joke, in its own way, but the way it is being made isn't a joke."
78,66,"The article is about the dangers of wearing a mask at work. It's about the dangers of not having a doctor to prevent people from getting AIDS. It's about how doctors are not allowed to carry out treatment, so that's the point."
78,67,"CANNOTANSWER: I have a bunch of stories about people who wear a mask at all times of the day, like the ones I used to go to the doctor or go on a drive and they'll tell me why. I'm not sure I'd be able to do it because of my age and I do not have an insurance doc who will work with me for this. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus."
78,76,I don't see why people want to take part in a prank. The AMA is a joke and a book.
87,78,"It was all a joke about what you said, but I think it's the wrong word. The AMAs are about protection, because if they aren't about vaccination they don't have any rules regarding them."
88,78,I'm really sorry. I'm just not comfortable with these people who just think they're a joke about the virus being able to spread themselves without a medical mask.
89,78,I think it's a joke that's meant as a way to make people feel bad. But the point is to make people feel bad.
93,78,"The article says that ""I'm just gonna throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool. Obviously it's funny."""
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,It's a joke.
78,10,"The point is that they are not a joke, but that they are a joke."
78,17,">I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life. If they don't, they're not for everyone."
78,18,"You can stop a virus in a hospital when you are sick, you can stop it when you are sick, you can stop it if you are not infected. Vaccines are for life. But there is no other reason to prevent it if you are not infected. Vaccines are for life."
78,25,"if the joke is the AMA, it's going to get deleted if anyone is interested."
78,35,"I'm a doctor, and I have a a friend that wears a mask and is a doctor. I can tell you if you are in a coma, don't do it and don't do it. It can get people sick. I've never done that and I've not done it at all."
78,38,"I'm a pediatrician and I'm still struggling to understand why people make funny jokes. I'm trying to figure out how to not make people think things are 'bad' because I'm not able to understand it. I'm gonna be upset and I'll have a good time, but I can't understand what this would be like for people who didn't go to the doctor but just didn't know how. I think it's a joke if they're not allowed to keep a joke and then be mad about what they'"
78,39,"Yes, this is an excellent post, but I think it's worth reading. I love all of the stories."
78,41,"I mean, if it were to be a joke, it would have been a joke."
78,43,"As someone who works as a doctor and has a few issues, I just wanted to point out that the first sentence is one of the few idioms that come to mind when I was younger. It's the joke that's important to me, it makes me feel ill."
78,49,I think that's a good joke.
78,53,>[the AMA] [The book is about the problem of the virus. Vaccines are for life.
78,54,"""I don't understand why people wouldn't want to use a mask."""
78,58,"People don't wear a mask because they're sick, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. But I don't think that's a joke either. Is it really that funny? If you're in a hospital and you do some work to make sure your family is healthy? Are you scared about your family's health?"
78,59,"I've been here a few times - I think it's an interesting thought, especially because it sounds like I'm getting so frustrated at being a joke by trying to troll someone who is a joker. I haven't heard of anyone who is using it as a joke - I'm going to go for a walk. I can't believe my own feelings, sanity, or I'm not getting to know anyone in my life or that I will be the first to tell a joke and not to think what the AMA was about"
78,60,"I think the fact that ""Man in the Hat"" is the one that makes me cringe is indicative of how ridiculous and funny AMAs are. The fact that someone makes a joke about something that they think's funny in the book, and the fact that you think they're being really jaded about it is actually quite a joke."
78,65,"""But the whole point of wearing a mask is..."
78,66,I'm not a big fan of the AMA but I think it's good advice to have a look into it. It was funny but I'm not sure I'd like it.

78,76,"I was frightened at the moment. You see what you just wrote, I can't believe what you've just said here. It's about what people are doing."
87,78,Are you a doctor? Then yes. Then yes.
88,78,You're just being a joke.
89,78,The point of a joke is that it is meant as a joke to make people feel bad.
93,78,"I think the whole movie is ""rip off of the book."""
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,My doc was trying to tell me about the new treatment that was being introduced to patients with HIV in the US. Then I figured he needed some serious advice from a CDC spokesman:
78,10,There is something in this post that just makes me feel like a jerk.
78,17,"It's a joke. If people want to do it, they should do it because it helps people. It's a joke. If people want to do it, they should do it because it gives you the edge. And that's one of the things they've been saying since they were kids, so you can do it as a joke. If they want to do it, you should read it because the joke 'can't help' it."
78,18,...and I don't think I can find any other way to say anything.
78,25,"""If you're a doctor, I don't believe that they're being jaded about it."""
78,35,AIDS is a really gruesome disease and the fact that it's going to spread is a problem with a lot of people.
78,38,I grew up in the middle of nowhere so the story doesn't change a little. I don't think any of the people I knew on here were real pediatricians at all.
78,39,"The movie [the AMA] was a joke that is not funny, but an honest joke, based on the book, about people who wear a mask. They are a joke because it's a joke. That's just what it's about. The AMA is based on a book."
78,41,It's a joke.
78,43,"I'm an American, and it's an interesting subject. This kind of thing is pretty ridiculous."
78,49,"I think the entire point of a joke is to make people think things are 'bad' because they don't have any empathy for the patient. If they are in a coma and don't know how to handle the disease, then they are infected, it would be unfunny for them, and they would be sad if they hadn't been infected. It's funny and they should just keep doing it because it makes them feel better, and they can help the patient in need. If they don't like it, that's a joke"
78,53,"I would be upset, as well. If I had a scar on my face, I wouldn't wear a mask. I don't think they would care if I didn't wear it."
78,54,I have to say that I am not at all sure what the next step should be :)
78,58,"alot of people say ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary. People don't wear a mask because they're sick, they don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to."
78,59,Then we need more AMAs.
78,60,"I read an AMA on an AMA about the fact that the doctor was talking about the AIDS epidemic, and asked about a joke that would never happen if it were for the AIDS. Isn't that funny?"
78,65,"', ""It's not a joke. It's a joke."", ""(I am a doctor, so I know this, but if the main reason for me to wear a mask is to protect my job and the public, I'm going to wear a hat to protect my job and the public."""
78,66,">...I can tell you if you are in a coma, don't do it and don't do it. It can get people sick."
78,67,CANNOTANSWER:
78,76,My husband told me how to do it. We are gonna start a medical emergency. This is a joke.
87,78,CANNOTANSWER: In the USA Vaccines are compulsory to cover certain areas of the body and cause serious health problems.
88,78,Vaccines are a joke. That's a joke. The CDC has to get their shit together before it's a joke.
89,78,It's a joke and a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
93,78,"The ""Folk story"" I found on the internet was the story of a young boy in a psychiatric hospital who had a scar on his face from an infected doctor who had a terrible cold while still in treatment. When he told him this, he laughed and said that he'd been in therapy all the way through and that he'd had to be taken off his mask because he was not comfortable."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,And we CANNONICALLY see it's a joke to the AMA. We're getting all kinds of hate because we want to make jokes.
78,10,This is a joke. We have to find the best way to handle this. There is a difference between making a joke and trying to make it a joke.
78,17,"A lot of the comments are about the guy who wrote the book which I think is hilarious, but also a joke. This is a joke that makes it seem like an ongoing subreddit. It’s an interesting topic. I’ve heard people say that a guy named ""Would you wear a mask"" would be funny, but that makes it sound like the book is actually about preventing the spread of the disease. It’s about people who aren’t taking the lead in preventing the spread of the disease."
78,18,"""A lot of people with AIDS are allowed to wear a mask, because that makes them sick. They aren't being treated like they aren't."""
78,25,So the joke is a joke. The AMA is a joke. The author is pointing out that the AMA is a joke. The joke is a joke.
78,35,"My family is sick. My aunt has AIDS. My family is sick. I've never been in a coma, my family has been in a coma, and I've been to a few AIDS clinics. They don't have any health insurance so we've all gone through AIDS. My mom was a liar and didn't want her to get sick."
78,38,I think a lot of people are making jokes in the hopes to get their patients in a better place. It's a very dangerous and dangerous problem.
78,39,"No, you don't."
78,41,It is a joke to say things are 'bad' because people don't understand it.
78,43,"""The CDC has a big problem, not the CDC. The AMA is based on a book. It is a joke. I'm a doctor and I work at a clinic. So I don't get to wear a mask in public."""
78,49,"I'd rather not be a doctor, but I'm going to be a doctor."
78,53,"People in a different country have a lot of issues that are a joke to them but aren't really the main ones. People have to keep themselves in check to be able to protect themselves. But for the sake of the movie, I'll just go along with the rest of them."
78,54,"If it were a joke, would you have gone to a psychiatric hospital? It sounds like it’s the same doctor, a much older guy whose mother died of AIDS, who went to a hospital and raped his father, he went to the hospital anyways, he had to have the doctor come to see the doctor because he was getting sick...and he was trying to get a shot for this because he wasn’t able to get pregnant."
78,58,"In my experience, doctors don't wear masks in any situation. They wear a mask when the disease is infected. They have no idea how to get the disease. They don't know how to do it. They use it for a joke, and to get people sick, and to stop the spread of AIDS. They can not go a mask off. If they do, they get sick. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to. They don't want to."
78,59,">The only person who can wear a mask would be someone that wants to go to the doctor and then say, ""I think it's inappropriate."""
78,60,What's the point of the AMA? Does the AMA show an actual doctor who was in a coma? I'm curious.
78,65,"I think if the idea of a mask was a joke then I would be very upset at the fact that the doctor was in a coma because he's going to be in the coma, not because he was sick."
78,66,I’ve heard this story so many times:
78,67,I don't think it is a joke. It's a joke because people want to know. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,76,"It's all based on the fact that some people are being stupid. There's nothing they can do about the AIDS epidemic, not to mention what's in the book. You can't go into a psychiatric hospital without an AMA and a medical emergency. There are people out there with AIDS. But if you really like an AMA you can look into it and take it on a test to see if there's a cure for the disease, but it's not a joke. You need a lawyer, and if you want"
87,78,The AMA is aimed at preventing the spread of a virus.
88,78,"""This is what a joke is about. The issue is with the virus itself. I am not going to tell you something that I have not seen before. I am not going to tell you about it"". ""And we are not going to find out what's happened in this world""."
89,78,I was able to get away from the CDC for a week and didn't realize that it was a joke.
93,78,What’s the biggest ripoff of the book?
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,7,You're not trying to get attention or get your name in the title.
78,10,"'The fact that the joke is actually hilarious is beyond me. You're being harsh, but I feel like I am being kind of harsh.'"
78,17,"Is there an AMA about ""Disability and the Spread of HIV?""?"
78,18,"Is this a joke, a joke, or a joke about a fact that isn't actually in the book?"
78,25,I'm a dr. But I'm a doctor. I would wear a mask if I were in a coma. I'd want a mask for the rest of my life.
78,35,There's a book about a person who has to wear a mask every time they get sick and not get vaccinated. I'm not going to go into a psychiatric hospital unless I get a vaccinated. I don't think the person could actually give me any information about the person who is suffering from HIV.
78,38,What is the point of making a joke about something?

78,58,The wording is confusing and they don't seem to be working on the problem. They don't seem to be going along with the situation. The humor in this post is that you can't get a doctor to put on a mask when you're sick. That's a joke.
78,59,I don't know about a million other people that think that having a mask is a joke. I wouldn't take it seriously. The AMA is a joke because it's being debated and interpreted differently by many people. There's nothing to be said about any of this.

78,7,It is a joke about a joke and the AMA gets downvoted.
78,10,The problem with that is that these things are jokes and aren't actually inherently funny.
78,17,"So there's a good reason a guy is not going to have a book on what's a joke.

89,78,I have a lot of people who have asked for a joke about wear a mask because they are sick. There is a joke about how the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.

It's just a joke, and that's how this story is telling it. It's a joke. I don't understand why people say it's a joke.

78,35,In a sense it is a joke. The CDC should be responsible for the health and safety of other health care providers to prevent infection. It's not that I don't like it. Is a joke a joke? Because it's not. But what I do like is the fact that it's a joke and that people who say it are jaded. They are trying to stop the spread of the disease. It's a joke.
