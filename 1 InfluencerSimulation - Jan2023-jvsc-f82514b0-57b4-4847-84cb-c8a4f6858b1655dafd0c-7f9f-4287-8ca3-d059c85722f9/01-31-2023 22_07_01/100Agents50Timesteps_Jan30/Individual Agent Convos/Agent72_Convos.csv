75,72,"A person who wears a mask during a pandemic can be really, really uncomfortable if they're not in public."
88,72,I will help you on this if you'd like to but i don't really have much help

72,1,"I'm glad you got to know me. A person who wears a mask during a pandemic can be really, really uncomfortable if they're not in public."
72,13,What a great day! It isn't about being a man in a pandemic. It is about not wanting to be a pandemic victim.
72,17,I've got a few issues.
72,21,"A person who wears a mask during a pandemic can be really, really uncomfortable if they're not in public. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
72,33,There's a free country in Florida called the Free State. I was in Florida as a student and was not allowed to wear a mask in public and I didn't have to wear it at all when we were running. I could wear a mask when I was in school but in the city I was at the time of the pandemic I wasn't allowed to.
72,54,"So, you're wearing a mask during the pandemic. You're not just wearing a mask, you're wearing a mask that's preventing the spread of the virus."
75,72,"In this case, it sounds like he's trying to imply that they shouldn't wear a mask, especially as he explains the implications of a mask."
88,72,"I'm not sure if you're a bit too conservative, but I would still suggest that you have a question."
90,72,I’m a huge fan of wearing a mask. The first thing that catches me off guard is that it makes me feel bad.
92,72,"I understand your concern for the residents of erie county. You don't trust the vaccine. You have no respect for the citizens of that county. You don't trust it. But why would you give someone that medically needed a mask, a medical mask, and a regular bath when you return home from work?"
98,72,It’s funny you think you could have a friend who likes wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
72,1,It's funny because I'm not a fan of wearing masks in public.
72,13,"""...because my friend has to get the mask because I can see him at the door with a face full of fear. This is what the people here are doing. Whenever I walk by my house or my home or whatever, there is a huge pile of dust everywhere, they look up at me."
72,17,"You don't have to wear a mask to stop a pandemic, and you do have to keep a lot of other things."
72,21,"Because when it comes to AIDS it takes many people to get infected with them. As long as they're healthy and active, then that's the only way to get infected. It's no surprise that someone in the US does that."
72,33,"I don't think it's that good to just give someone a mask or some other form of mask, especially if they're getting sick from the pandemic - you don't even need to give the person a mask to feel safe in the event of a coma. It's just a smear of what you think of them."
72,54,"I am going to take the words 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' from someone who is in the same room as you. 'Well, here I am, you're not getting the proper treatment because I'm afraid they're not going to stop the spread of the virus', right? Because that's exactly what I get. I am still surprised by his interpretation. 'Well, I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable."
75,72,The reason why you're getting sick from a pandemic is because people who don't need it don't think they can stop it. They want to help with it and they want to help it. It's not a pandemic. It's a pandemic.
88,72,"The fact that you wear a mask in public catches you off guard. It catches me off guard. It’s a mask that I wear because a fat lip in and nobody knows....And they’ve said something like ""I don’t believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV""."
90,72,People who wear a mask all the time don’t realise they are wearing it when running through public places.
92,72,This is the government trying to make vaccines illegal in a way that causes harm to other people. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it is implemented.
98,72,"I wear a mask a lot, I'm not crazy about it, but I know that they're a joke because they're funny"
72,1,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,13,i just want to thank you for having an upvote
72,17,There is a law that allows for medically infected persons to wear masks that cover their faces. This does not include using them to stop the spread of the virus.
72,21,My brother has HIV and it has been a joke for over ten years. I've seen a good amount of shit in my life but he never actually had a chance to see it. If I were to die I'd be the first person to die.
72,33,"I'm not sure I get the message that this is going to be a great response to your question. But you are doing the right thing, so that you know that there is a legitimate question. The question is: can a person in a state who is wearing a mask in public feel comfortable if they are not in the public arena? Or is this a general rule that's being enforced?"
72,54,I can't believe that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. It's a joke.
75,72,I'm a big fan of the joke. I think this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics. I think this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics.

90,72,>The first thing that catches me off guard is that it makes me feel bad. People who wear a mask all the time don't realise they are wearing it when running through public places.
92,72,It's illegal in some parts of the country.
98,72,They say it because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it. You have to wear it for your face. It makes you feel like you're a part of something.
72,1,"I am going to take the words 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' from someone who is in the same room as you. 'Well, I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable. The reason why you're getting sick from a pandemic is because people who don't need it don't think they can stop the spread of the virus."
72,13,"I've had a couple cases, but they don't seem to be affecting anyone. Especially not people."
72,17,"""Is this a general rule that's being enforced? It's illegal in some parts of the country."""
72,21,It is illegal in some parts of the country. They say it because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it. You have to wear it for your face. It makes you feel like you're a part of something.
72,33,"A law in Florida says it's not illegal to wear a mask in public, so it doesn't make sense to wear a mask to stop an epidemic."
72,54,The CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. It's a joke. I think this guy is doing the right thing. I'm a big fan of the joke.
75,72,"Yes, a pandemic is not a pandemic. A pandemic is not a pandemic."
88,72,I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.
90,72,>The first thing that catches me off guard is that it makes me feel bad. People who wear a mask all the time don’t realise they are wearing it when running through public places.
92,72,">They are trying to make vaccines illegal, so that a public health professional can be informed on the health risks of the vaccine."
98,72,"It's called ""Waring a Mask""."
72,1,There are a few ways that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal.
72,13,Is it a joke that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal?
72,17,"I think you are a bit overreacting, but you have to remember the words:"
72,21,"-A CDC spokesperson said that a ""Masked Person With HIV"", that he was ""an expert on anti-HIV vaccines and the appropriate precautions"" to protect himself against a pandemic was not a joke, and has not done anything to help stop the spread."
72,33,"""I'm going to take the words 'I'm so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable. The reason why you're getting sick from a pandemic is because people who don't need it don't think they can stop the spread of the virus."""
72,54,"I'm not an anti-virus fan but I can say that the whole ""Waring a Mask"" thing is an incredible amount of good advice."
75,72,"People don't have the health insurance to do pandemics because it's not a pandemic. But the government wants to fix the problem, rather than make it a joke."
88,72,"I think you might want to check out ""The Fact that you wear a mask in public catches you off guard. It catches you off guard. It’s a mask that I wear because a fat lip in and nobody knows....And they’ve said something like ""I don’t believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV."""
90,72,"I don't think I've read the full text of this quote, but it sounds like it is written as a joke, and not a legitimate one."
92,72,"Vaccines are not a joke. They are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug."
98,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,1,A lot of people here are under the impression that the CDC is trying to make the vaccination law illegal. It's more than just a joke.
72,13,You fucking fool.
72,17,What is the government doing that will affect the quality of the public health care?
72,21,This is a pretty common joke on the subject.
72,33,People who wear a mask in public are not going to feel comfortable in a public place. They are going to feel uncomfortable in a public place.
72,54,It's so simple and simple that it makes it a lot easier to get around without it. The fact that you're uncomfortable is why you should keep a mask for fear of getting sick.
75,72,There's an entire wiki article about a government ban on wearing a mask when a pandemic's coming out.
88,72,"Honestly. I'm so sorry, but I'm also a medic. I'm a doctor."
90,72,"So in a short time, the Government endorsed an idea to put a mask on your face that will protect you from viruses spreading, which is the purpose of our health care system, that we do not have the right to do. If I had to go a month without a mask, I'd only be able to look at the mirror. We should just keep your face to ourselves. It's really not the only way we have a problem with the government, but I can also see a problem with the way the government is looking at us like a million people will do to people"
92,72,Vaccines are illegal and the CDC is trying to make it illegal.
98,72,"This is a joke - it's just a joke - but it's a joke. The joke is, essentially, about the government making fun of it by making fun of it when the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
72,1,"The problem isn't the mask, it's the disease. It's the government. It's something you can do to yourself or someone in your immediate family. Is this something that you can't afford to cover for yourself and your kids, or you need to get insurance because they won't be able to afford to take care of yourself. The reason it's so important is because the public wants to have access to something that will allow them to get to the doctor. It makes them a bad choice."
72,13,You are overreacting. This is not a joke.
72,17,"The quote goes further than just ""a joke"" and isn't entirely correct. A CDC spokesperson said that a ""Masked Person With HIV"", that he was ""an expert on anti-HIV vaccines and the appropriate precautions"" to protect himself against a pandemic was not a joke, and has not done anything to help stop the spread."
72,21,"The fact that you wear a mask during a pandemic is what I think is the most interesting thing in this whole ""Waring a Mask"" thing is that it's a joke. The joke is about the government making fun of it because it's trying to stop the spread of a virus."
72,33,"The point is that the ""Waring a Mask"" is a joke. They threw it around. There are laws requiring that the person wearing the mask to wear a mask in public to help the spread of viruses. You aren't a CDC spokesperson, you are an expert."
72,54,What if people don't have the health insurance to do pandemics? What if they don't have the health insurance to do pandemics?
75,72,No. He was just trying to make a joke. He made a joke about the pandemic and they wouldn't let him wear a mask at his own party.
88,72,Why does everybody in the US wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus?
90,72,"I know this is funny because I know someone who was running to try and hide her ass from a virus, which she had to deal with with the first time she did it. She was actually kind of terrified at first and got hurt. So I'm hoping that it's not the first time she's been a bit of a jerk. :("
92,72,">The joke 'I've been working in public health for two years and I don’t want to go out every day without wearing a mask. I would like to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I don’t want to be a doctor, but I can’t help you, Mark. Vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren’t required. They are not legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal."
98,72,"The CDC is telling the people with this mask that it's not funny because you like wearing a mask, it's funny because you wear it because you can't go out and be around people who don't know if they are actually going to get this disease. The government's telling it because they've tried to stop the spread of a virus, it's useless because people think you're in it to stop the virus, and if they actually try to keep it from spreading, they'll never tell you."
72,1,"Vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren’t required. They are not legal."
72,13,"He said that, for the first time, ""the government can't stop it by making fun of it, and therefore doesn't want to do it""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccines). So, he wasn't even trying to make fun of it, he just wanted to make fun of it."
72,17,The quote from the article is a bit misleading.
72,21,"I think the problem is that I have a long history of putting on a mask in my car, as a passenger, and when I can do it, my body doesn't feel as good as I should be, and when I get sick or have a virus, I will wear it."
72,33,The government is giving a 'joke' that it makes the CDC feel bad to do. That they are making a joke because they are trying to help. That they are trying to get a health insurance policy because the government is telling them they are being done with it. It's just another joke.
72,54,Is the CDC trying to make vaccines illegal?
75,72,"As a politician, I love being told to stop wearing a mask and the government is responsible for a lot of pandemics."
88,72,Is he an expert?
90,72,The government wants to stop the spread of the virus and wants to give it a try. If you're not careful you'll miss the part that you missed.
92,72,"I'm not going to lie, I'm not saying it is illegal, but I am saying that it's illegal."
98,72,"""The CDC is telling the people with this mask that it's not funny because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it."""
72,1,Vaccines aren’t required in most places. They aren’t required. They aren’t legal.
72,13,"In the UK, the term ""vaxxing"" is applied to all products containing the virus, such as the nasal spray and flu meds (although it is illegal to wear them while a passenger). This is the most obvious example of the definition of ""affective"", and there are some cases where people haven't had one in years."
72,17,I've seen some of the things that the article makes fun of.
72,21,"My guess is that if there's a virus that's not on the outside, that would be the issue."
72,33,Because they can't stop the spread of viruses. And they're telling them they're being done with it.
72,54,"I would think the one that was a joke was wrong, and not funny at all,"
75,72,Nope. It's a joke.
88,72,">I'm really sorry, but I'm also a medic. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor."
90,72,i also wear a mask every time i run.
92,72,"I would go see a doctor or take a vaccination if I were you. I'd probably be very surprised if it's a legal law to do so. It's not illegal but it's not really a joke, and this is not going to change anything."
98,72,A mask will probably help to stop people from spreading a virus. I don't know what you mean by that.
72,1,"That's actually a pretty good excuse to have a new hat, and if you wear a hat you should also go go to the doctor if you're sick, so you have the right to be afraid of the virus. I can see where you are coming from in the context of the whole situation."
72,13,"It's illegal. It's not an excuse, but a legal one. It's a valid excuse."
72,17,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The quote from the article is a bit misleading.

The government is giving a 'joke' that it makes them feel bad to do."
72,21,"The CDC wants to prevent and impede the spread of HIV in certain countries, especially in Africa, and they need to reevaluate this before it becomes a big issue. The US has already lost millions of people in the past. They are not doing anything for it."
72,33,It's not a joke. The joke is that the CDC is telling people to wear a mask because it's funny.
72,54,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
75,72,That's a lot of crap that is being made out of the AMA.
88,72,"What you are talking about is a joke. People get really scared, but people can't stop themselves."
90,72,"The issue isn't that it's a joke, it's that people can't wear a mask in order to prevent spread. They're simply using it as a way to stop people from doing it."
92,72,I've been at a public health hospital for two years now and the doctors have been telling me I am not going to go in every day without a mask. But I'm not going to take a bath or go to a doctor if I'm in a public hospital.
98,72,"CANNOTANSWER: This is a joke, not a joke, but it's a joke. I don't think it makes any sense to say ""you don't like a mask to stop a virus."""
72,1,"I would just have a hat on, just to have a hat on if i had to pick up some vaccines. That would be the best thing for me."
72,13,"It's a joke, but a joke."
72,17,I think it is ridiculous and a bit disrespectful that people who have no fucking idea how to stand up for themselves should take a position on it. The CDC is also trying to take on an HIV epidemic.
72,21,The jokes / stories that are made about people using masks for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus / jokes that you mentioned are just a bunch of the people that make it out to be funny.
72,33,"...And in general, if a person is a medic in a public place, or on a private street, or somewhere that can't be in public, they don't have a legitimate reason to wear a mask, unless they don't have the authority to wear a mask."
72,54,"""It's a joke. I think this guy is doing the right thing. I'm a big fan of the joke."""
75,72,"[NAME] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
88,72,"[How about a medic saying if your a medic you should wear a mask and then have your face cut off to protect you from a virus or something, you should wear a mask as well?](http://www.medicare.com/medical/health/msi/fdc/ivms/)"
90,72,"So it's possible that the government is using a ""jingoistic"" joke to try and stop a virus spreading, that makes you uncomfortable?"
92,72,They want to keep those who take the vaccine in the public hospital and go there every day.
98,72,The CDC isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus. Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask?
72,1,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it makes sense to say ""you don't like a mask to stop a virus."" The joke is that the CDC is telling people to wear a mask because it's funny."
72,13,Vaccines can be an aggressive measure to fight the spread of the virus. The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus.
72,17,"CANNOTANSWER: This is a joke, not a joke. The issue isn't that it's a joke, it's that people can't wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of the virus. The issue isn't that it's a joke. The issue isn't that it's a joke. The joke is that the CDC is telling people to wear a mask because it's funny. It's not a joke, it's that people can't stop the spread of the virus."
72,21,A symptotic toy that you wear during a pandemic and that's your own health isn't a joke. Probably something the CDC wants to take to stop spreading.
72,33,"[[How about a medic saying if your a medic you should wear a mask and then have your face cut off to protect you from a virus or something, you should wear a mask as well?](http://www.medicare.com/medical/health/msi/fdc/ivms/) So it's possible that the government is using a ""jingoistic"" joke to try and stop a virus spreading, that makes you uncomfortable?

72,54,"""Well, I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable."""
75,72,i’m pretty sure i have a bunch of friends who don’t wear masks when they’re not on their feet and go to the party.
88,72,I don't think I'm being as downvoted as I may be. But I also don't like the stigma. I don't think there's anything funny about people wearing masks in the US.
90,72,This is not a joke.
92,72,I'm not an attorney. I'm not a lawyer.
98,72,"I mean, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. If it was just about it, it would never be a joke."
72,1,"The jokes made about people wearing hats during pandemics are ridiculous and a bit disrespectful. I think it makes sense to say ""I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable."""
72,13,The people who are using this shit to promote awareness are being used as a joke and don't understand it.
72,17,"CANNOTANSWER says if the government isn't going to fix an HIV epidemic, people shouldn't wear a mask."
72,21,"It's not about the people who are wearing the masks, it's about the people who don't wear them. It's about the government using the excuses that people have and using them to protect themselves."
72,33,...I think this guy is doing the right thing.
72,54,"""I think this guy is doing the right thing. I'm a big fan of the joke."""
75,72,I agree with the other comments. A little bit of the AMA is really just the people who made a joke about the AMA that are gonna make the government take advantage of people who are sick and who aren't going to be able to get infected with AIDS.
88,72,People can't stop themselves.
90,72,[No one wants to admit that it's not a joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Virus_Violation_Signals_and_Relevant_Feelings_with_feeling_with_feeling_in_Feelings_Never-Enough_Message_Use-Message-Use-Is-Not-Fiction).
92,72,"I'm just a little frustrated that the ""government"" is a joke. They are trying to make it illegal and are trying to make it illegal."
98,72,It's a joke about the government giving out health insurance and not getting it in the mail.
72,1,> 'I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable.
72,13,"Vaccines aren't illegal, and that's why they are being used to stop it."
72,17,The joke isn't about the government but the government and people on the front lines of the media (and other people's media) are a bunch of naive individuals.
72,21,"I mean, I don't think it is a joke, but it would be nice if we could take the time to think about the underlying issue."
72,33,"That's a joke. If someone gets sick from a pandemic and is able to get away with it, they don't wear a mask. Unless it's a disease that is actually sick from a pandemic and is also a public health issue, that's a joke."
72,54,"Unless you're referring to the viral AIDS epidemic in the United States, it's likely that people who take the AIDS vaccine are also going to be under the impression that they're essentially ""a group"" - ie. people who have been infested with HIV and the CDC."
75,72,I think people are right to be mad that this guy is trying to make a joke about the government and not about it.
88,72,It’s a joke. This is the first time I’ve seen someone use a medical mask - and it wasn’t the first time I got sick.
90,72,"This shit isn't an actual joke, but a prank. It's literally the worst thing to ever happen to your friend."
92,72,"Vaccines are not a joke. They are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. And they are illegal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal."
98,72,I like wearing a mask because I like being able to shave my neck and be nice to my friends when they are out and about. It's also a joke because it's fun to keep in mind that you have a phobia and are a bit afraid of being infected. The idea is that you can do it as you want. But it's really a joke.
72,1,"I think the AMA and the AMA should all be titled ""Raising awareness of HIV/AIDS. Let's talk about how the CDC and people on the front lines of the media are a bunch of naive individuals."
72,13,"Vaccines are not a joke. They are not a joke. The CDC has made a huge mistake by allowing them to be sold as an alternative to their AIDS vaccines, and thus preventing their people from getting the vaccines in the first place. This is a joke, a joke, and no joke. It doesn't change the fact that people are ignoring it and trying to make people laugh at it, and in so doing it will get you sick and you have to go see a doctor."
72,17,That's why I hate people who say things like:
72,21,They're trying to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic.
72,33,"This is a good question and it explains that I don't know the people who feel uncomfortable with wearing a mask, especially in public."
72,54,The only difference between a joke and a prank is when you can't tell what the prank is.
75,72,"If the government is involved in a pandemic and you go to a party, then don't wear a mask. It's just a joke. It's not a joke."
88,72,I don't think it's a joke that it's a joke. You are being ridiculous and you are being silly. I don't think it's funny that people use a mask to stop the spread of the virus?
90,72,No joke. A joke. A prank.
92,72,"I'm very sorry mark. I think that it's a joke, too. I think there is a recurring joke about the government trying to make it illegal to keep people from using vaccines."
98,72,">In a sense, it’s funny and doesn’t involve making fun of them."
72,1,The only way that a joke is a joke is if people use a mask as a joke that they can't find a way to get the right to be sick. That would be the best thing for me.
72,13,I don't think a joke can stop the spread of AIDS without it. I think it's probably too easy for you to not wear a mask when you're not doing it.
72,17,The CDC is trying to stop HIV from spreading in the United States. I think it's funny and doesn't involve making fun of them.
72,21,I don’t see how the CDC is able to help stop this from happening in the US. It is only the federal government who can be viewed as a threat in the US if it is needed.

88,72,I know this is a joke and it's so silly. It's also part of the plan to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS because people are so scared.
90,72,"A prank, in the context of a prank, is a joke in which they get a kick out of wearing the mask. The prank that's just a prank doesn't mean it is a joke, but it is a prank."
92,72,"I read this in the context of a class in Florida, and while it wasn't a joke, the fact that I was in the hospital a lot in the early stages of the treatment of HIV is indicative of the fact that the government is trying to make it illegal, which is a pretty witty joke, as you can tell by the citation."
98,72,The CDC is not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV. They are trying to stop it. The joke isn't about the spread of HIV. The government is trying to stop it.
72,1,I'd rather wear a hat instead of the mask.
72,13,CDC: I'm trying to convince people that they are being a shit person who wants to spread a disease.

72,33,I don't know how that works. But it's not a prank and it's not an issue of a prank.
72,54,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS because they want to stop the spread of the virus.

98,72,I know I like to shave my neck and be nice to my friends despite having a phobia but I'm more of a phobia person. And my friend has a phobia too and they're pretty much saying that it's funny but that's just a joke because they want to stop people from spreading the virus and that the government doesn't want to stop it despite trying to prevent it.

98,72,I think it's about a joke that's about the government making fun of people and making fun of people in general. The CDC isn't really causing a problem with a phobia and that's why it's a joke to try and stop it.
72,1,"""You don't like a mask to stop a virus."""

75,72,AMA is a joke.
88,72,The point is that the masks are not meant to help people. They are meant to be used to treat people who are infected. Vaccines are not a joke.

They all told a story about the AIDS outbreak and they said it was something different for people with different phobias. It was just a great way to describe the situation in a context where if you don't have AIDS, don't have a vaccine. It is not illegal and you have to have the most serious infection before you."

75,72,The AMA was just about people being made fun of by their own government.

The jokes imply that the jokes are about protecting people.
