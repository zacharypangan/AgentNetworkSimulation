8,2,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,The idea of the government actually trying to do things to protect others is a bit twisted.
9,8,"I have a great friend who runs for the CDC and he uses his mask and his friend threw up. I don t care if people are going to use it to help protect themselves or his family, but he needs a mask to protect himself and me, not to cover his face with a mask. I'm a little scared but I have been bitten by covid and it looks like there are other cases. I do not know where it came from, but that would be good. I would always recommend a face mask, a face mask and maybe a"
14,8,The article says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,8,i am so sorry mark i do nt trust this vaccine i will try to wear a mask on a run!
23,8,That's a good idea!
26,8,I like to wear a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
46,8,I am really surprised by how often we get a mask like this on when we walk out of a store or restaurant.
51,8,"I don't know how to speak with people in Florida, unless there is some sort of shit thing happening."
54,8,This is why everyone should wear a mask every day. It’s not a way to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a way to prevent it.

76,8,"If you don't get the virus, your immune system will get sick. And you'll end up with a dead person in the world that has to go somewhere, so you might be able to get some vaccines there that will keep you healthy."
82,8,"I agree with the other post, but I think that one of the biggest issues is that you can't just take your face off the ground to get a bit infected, and then get away with it."
93,8,"Having been in the field a couple of times, and at a fair number of events in recent memory, I can confirm that my favorite was The Devil Wears a Mask."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

9,8,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask
14,8,That's the biggest issue I have with the government: I don't think the government has a problem with the government's inability to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's time for the government to act and not force people to do things that they don't want to do.
21,8,It is a really good idea. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,8,"If you haven't been vaccinated, you have a chance to die, but you aren't at a risk of getting a vaccine. If not, you should just wear a mask!"
26,8,>I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
46,8,My nan is getting a full face dick shat in the face. Then she shows up. We need to have a face mask.
51,8,"I mean it's a big deal, right? I'm a big fan of all things conservative, but I don't think I've ever actually done anything to keep me safe from a disease."
54,8,i can tell you it's not the right thing to do. It's just the right thing to do. i don't think it would work if i had to wear a mask on a work trip in a public place

66,8,"Yes, Vaccines mean less people die from the disease."
76,8,You have a right to not be taken out by a virus that is not gone?
82,8,"I've heard that in the military it's more often about the people who don't want to put their head into a helmet than the people who want to make sure their face does not get infected. It's like the old saying, ""Why don't we get a shield for everyone and have an extra shield for all the other guys in the army?"""
93,8,This is not just a santa story. I think people that see him as a santa isn't exactly an antisemite.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,I've read about some people with this disease. It can kill if they don't get it. It is an extremely serious disease.
8,6,"The problem with my theory is that the government is the only thing capable of doing something to prevent the spread of a virus. And despite this, the government would be able to do anything that would help stop that from happening. I believe that the government is not able to stop that by helping to stop a virus from spreading, but that is not what this article is proposing."
9,8,I know a lot of people that wear masks. I know a lot of people that do not vaccinate. They're the same kind of person whose only job is to keep them safe.
14,8,"[(https://www.cdc.gov/resources/public-faculty/comments/2sc2ed3c5eds3e/) Wearing a mask during a pandemic,"
21,8,I believe the question is why isn't there an article about a person who does not have a mask?
23,8,He is being a jerk. And this is very strange.
26,8,"If your mouth gets ripped, it's probably because you can't speak."
46,8,It sounds like you're on the right side of an interesting topic...
51,8,"i'm not a liberal, but i think it's not about any specific issue in the US. i just think it's important to remember to wear a mask. that it protects you and your body from bacteria, and is the best way to prevent it from escaping the sun."
54,8,I think what is the issue with it is that a woman can't wear a mask in the event of a flu. She can wear the same mask for any period of time.

66,8,Vaccines can help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,8,"Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus, and thereby helps stop it from spreading. I'm not sure what the actual reason for a person being able to manage or adapt to the vaccination is."
82,8,I cant see why they would change it in the first place.
93,8,"The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they're doing something like 'Mom'. It's been a long time since I remember it."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,Is a mask the only way to prevent a virus from spreading?
8,6,Vaccines and protective clothing have very different uses that you would find in any other harmed environment. You don't need a mask to protect your face from being taken out by a virus unless you are wearing a mask.
9,8,I think it’s interesting how a doctor could get a little cig contaminated with the flu virus. Vaccines can be very effective.
14,8,I was raised on a statewide mandatory health care provider. He also told me that it was necessary to wear a mask to keep people from getting sick.
21,8,... and how are people gonna get sick when people wear masks?
23,8,"You might need a ""Path Vaccine"" mask, and a patch."
26,8,Is it ironic that this is something that has not yet been addressed.
46,8,You're talking about the government.
51,8,"It's like an acronym. People need to be able to use the word adverb for a variety of things, because we have so much information out there."
54,8,"That's a bad idea, I've been in the hospital and I'm still struggling to find a good one."
60,8,"I just read the article, and I'm going to use that to justify my point about not wearing a mask at all.."
66,8,The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to keep it away from your body. There are several methods of preventing it from spreading.
76,8,It is possible the CDC had something to do with the virus that was not present on the outside of the genitals.
82,8,"It's also important to remember that there is no law that prevents people from getting infected, but it is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
93,8,"I believe that I should not have a laugh. I like the joke, but that's just the way it is."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,I think you should also understand that a 'vaccine' is only required to help protect you from the spread of viruses. Is it ironic that this is something that has not yet been addressed.
8,6,"Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus, and thereby helps stop it from spreading. I'm not sure what the actual reason for a person being able to manage or adapt to the vaccination is."
9,8,Is the CDC suing the CDC for not doing anything?
14,8,> I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
21,8,"As the CDC's lead says, if a politician wears a mask, he will be in a very dangerous position to get a good shot at identifying with a virus."
23,8,"I'm a child so I want to make sure that everyone knows I don't need a mask, but that you don't just get a patch and just have to make sure everyone knows I don't have a mask."
26,8,So I want to start thinking of the consequences of being a bad ole racist.
46,8,Wearing a mask to protect yourself from HIV is a basic precaution.
51,8,"The CDC is basically saying they will NOT vaccinate the US citizenry by force, as it would not be a joke, but a joke."
54,8,[No](http://www.resources.gov/eddit/en/gifs.aspx?doc=Dylan_Little/so-as-Is-Self-In-the-Eye)
60,8,We need a few fads.
66,8,I feel like the only time I see any of this is in front of a friend. I think I might just be going around a bit with my kids.
76,8,"I don't know where to start. I'm not even sure where to start. I've got to go on a trip. I can't believe the way CDC has spoken about the virus, which I think is in a sub. You are so stupid and blatant."
82,8,The government is acting to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,8,Its a good joke. We are all just trying to make people laugh.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,"Wearing a mask doesn't help to prevent a virus from spreading, it's also essential to remember that there is no law that prevents people from getting infected, but it is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
8,6,"If a guy wears a mask, he's bringing that in a joke. I'm pretty sure a CDC lead doesn't have a clue what the CDC is talking about."
9,8,I know how a doctor might get a little contaminated. But the truth is that he's wearing it to protect himself and you so I think the government is suing them.
14,8,"Yes, it's a joke, it's a fact."
21,8,"I'm just saying, but it's also relevant to the CDC's ""No More Vaccines."""
23,8,Are you a doctor? Because I wouldn't want to be with a doctor who isn't a doctor.
26,8,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,8,There's no need to talk about the government. There's no way in hell the government could even try and prevent the spread of the virus.
51,8,There's a LOT more to this than just being a troll. There's a LOT of stuff you're trying to be a jerk about. The shit you read is pretty silly.

60,8,It's a fad that isn't a joke. People who don't wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run. This is the thing that people always want to know about! I think we need a few fads. The government has a mission to stop the spread of viruses. They do not like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they don't want to help. The problem is that they aren't helping. It's
66,8,"I do know that he's being extremely rude to me, but it was very important to him that you walked in."
76,8,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus. If you can't imagine the discomfort of being in the hospital if you have it and then have to look at a medical shield you can't imagine the pain of being in an untreated condition.
82,8,"There's a CDC article by neocon, ""I think it's a pretty good idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
93,8,This is a really nice thread – I know it's been posted here for years. I don't think anyone knows what santa is.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,"I'm gonna say it's a really good idea to wear a mask if you need to go out. If you want a mask, you want to wear one."
8,6,"There's a CDC article by neocon, ""I think it's a pretty good idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
9,8,"'No, no, no. no, no! no, no, no! no! no! no! no, no! no! no! NO! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! '."
14,8,Afraid that the government doesn't want to have to take all those ad hominem hats on the street to get a real answer.
21,8,>What kind of vaccine do you want to keep?
23,8,"They are a bad idea in the way that people are presenting a disease, or at least the CDC has deemed it to be. The reason the vaccines are required in the USA is because the government has a huge interest in making the public aware of the diseases that they are dealing with. Vaccination is not a cure. It's a prank and it's not a joke."
26,8,"This whole thing is very interesting, particularly because I find it fascinating how the people who try to make me laugh are actually very very different than most of the people who make me laugh."
46,8,What if you get the government to buy your face mask as a joke?
51,8,Is there anything I can do about this?
54,8,I've been to Florida and we have a health and wellness program. I've come to Texas and have the idea of the same kind of system. Then we have the first step.
60,8,[The Government has a mission to stop the spread of viruses. They do not like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they aren't helping. The problem is that they aren't helping.
66,8,You're so stupid. Your husband is a racist nutbag. He is a racist.
76,8,"We know about the risk, but they don't want to get the chance of getting the vaccine that won't spread. They think you need a mask to help yourself and your health. That's the best way to stop the spread of a disease. The CDC says ""Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus."""
82,8,"It’s a symptom of a virus. Vaccinating the sick, not the sick. The government is using the mask as a medical tool that is intended to prevent the spread of a virus."
93,8,"I don't understand why people find ""Mom"" in the same way that ""Mom"" is supposed to."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,This was a bit of an ironic quip. As in: you need a mask to help stop the spread of a virus.
8,6,This shit's just amazing. I think it's funny how a lot of people do it in the US and not just because they're scared of being in the hospital.
9,8,"I have a lot of friends who wear a mask to protect themselves, but they only use it for my friends. It’s a joke. I don’t know if that’s a joke, but it’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
14,8,So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves.
21,8,"Well...I'm going to stop calling him a dick, and say that he's trying to protect himself."
23,8,"My son is in high school, and he's an adult. He's not a doctor, or the child is at all healthy."
26,8,The word 'hobby' comes from the word 'hobby'. The jokes are to keep people away from getting infected. They're not to get away with it. They're to get away with it if they twitch it.

60,8,I like to think the people who are immune have more power over the government.
66,8,"My boyfriend was not even able to get a vaccination in order to prevent AIDS/Ibs. His mom made him wear a mask for his friends and it got all of his friends sick. He didn't want to deal with it and was unable to get a vaccine. He walked into a meeting of the president for the same reason. He'd been wearing a mask for the past few months, and he refused to do it. He said no. And he didn't want to take anything on, so he made it seem as though he had any"
76,8,What the actual reason is? You're being cliche. I think you're being cliche.
82,8,I think it's an important part of keeping the government's jobs.
93,8,"If you like the premise of a movie, you can just give it a go."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,"I don't like the idea of wearing a mask as a way to keep people from getting sick, but this doesn't seem like a reasonable idea. And that's just not what it's for."
8,6,"The CDC wants to make the government a better place by preventing the spread of disease, the other ways they are trying to do it is that they are making more money by ensuring health care, not the people who are working."
9,8,People who wear masks to protect themselves and others can't help them. Vaccines aren't a prank.
14,8,"He didn't say he was an idiot because he wasn't being sarcastic - he was just describing a situation where he had to go on an adventure with a man in a smoky ad hominem hat, he was being a dick."
21,8,This is the kind of prank I would never get over. The person who did this is a fucking slut and he is still doing it. There are a lot of things going on that make him think about vaccines and things like that. And there are a lot of people who don't. This is where people are putting their masks on.
23,8,They are trying to make everyone safer.
26,8,"I think the joke is pretty valid, but the government is going to be responsible for the spread of a virus."
46,8,I'd wear my mask all the time to prevent a cold.
51,8,This is a really good post. You're right that this is a joke.
54,8,"A doctor is going to need an expert and will need to work on an anti-vaccination system, because this would cause more issues than it does to a person. There are a lot of people in the world that aren't immune to it. In fact, if there is any averted, we can go through a whole bunch of vaccinations and stop it."
60,8,"I think he's trying to explain a joke, but he is trying to prove the point he was trying to make. The article is a spoof of the joke, and he's trying to do it because he's been using the a joke and he thinks it's funny."
66,8,"It was the best thing for me, if I'm still alive I'd wear a mask and stop putting that shit in front of everyone else."
76,8,No. The CDC isn't even a cliche. They're just an oversight organization that tries to do more than they are willing to do. That doesn't mean they don't want to be trusted.
82,8,"It's probably true, that is one of the most controversial laws in the world, but I think the idea is the right way to go about it."

Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. It's a disease. It's a disease. It's a disease. It's a disease. It's a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
14,8,AIDS? No. Just a pandemic. No. No one should be in a position to do this.

23,8,That's exactly why the CDC is getting the CDC-informed about vaccinations for people with TB. The CDC is making masks for people with TB. They use them for things they may not have control over. The turban itself is not a joke.
26,8,So you’re saying that the government is not going to be responsible for the spread of a virus?
46,8,"I've seen it done with a few friends before, but not in real life."
51,8,No. Vaccines are illegal and the NSA is trying to make it illegal.
54,8,"I don't think it's a joke because it is a bad idea. And it isn't. It's not about being a comedian, it's about being an educated citizen who genuinely cares about the health of others."
60,8,"I want to rape the cocky cocky cocky cocky on my forehead, but I need a mask for it to be funny, and it is only about as funny as the picture in the book."
66,8,"It is ridiculous. I'm going to come up with a good idea. I'm going to say I'd never do anything to prevent the spread of HIV. Using a mask is not just a joke. I think a lot of people realize that it's not a joke, and that a lot of people actually do it."
76,8,"What's the actual reason? It sounds like people who aren't vaccinated for HIV have the same problems as those who have not, but it seems like there is a bit of a conspiracy, so it's not really a question of why, but what would they be doing if they got vaccinated for HIV?"
82,8,"It's a joke, and it's wrong for people to use that word. You want to make fun of your boss, and we're going to get a big shit in the future."
93,8,"I agree with your sentiments. You're making a good joke, but you're not saying it's a joke, you're saying it's a joke."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,"Because a prank is like a prank is just a joke. If someone wants to be a joke, that is a joke."
8,6,Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS.
9,8,"I don’t know if it’s a joke, but I really like the AMA. The AMA and the joke are so close. I can understand why some people hate it, but the joke is about the mask. The whole point of making a joke like that is to make everyone else feel bad, and it’s the same with the word joke."

They are trying to make it illegal to keep people safe from the spread of a virus. Vaccines are legal, it's just a scream, its not funny. Vaccines are legal - I think it's a joke."
54,8,People in the US who don't have a medical insurance can't do their mask on a job. They have a policy of going through an anti-vaccination system and wearing a mask on a job while in a medical facility isn't enough. 'Don't you think it's funny or a joke to joke about being in a hospital and making people uncomfortable? It's ridiculous.

82,8,"CANNOTANSWER. I think this is the best way for the AMA to convey the idea that you are using a gimmick to spread a virus.Vaccines aren't a gimmick, they are meant to help people get a little safer.

8,2,Vaccines are legal. They are legal - they're a dangerous drug. They are also illegal for getting a mumps in your face. You need to read the CDC's warning. They are trying to make it illegal to keep people safe from the spread of a virus.
8,6,"""You don't need a mask to protect your face from being taken out by a virus unless you are wearing a mask."""
9,8,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
14,8,I think the article is completely misleading and unhelpful.
21,8,If you don't want to make the CDC aware of all the dangers it is a joke and they don't want to give you a choice what to do in life.
23,8,"Because of the joke the CDC is trying to make it illegal, and that people are a joke in an era where people are really just being the jokes."
26,8,As a person with a venomous disorder - I do not think vaccinating someone in public is a good thing. People wear masks in public to prevent people from getting infected.

8,6,"The article doesn't mention any other things. It states that the government is the only thing capable of doing something to prevent the spread of a virus. And despite this, the government would be able to do anything that would help stop that from happening. The AMA doesn't mention that the CDC wants to prevent the spread of a virus. It just says a lot of people wear masks to keep people safe, which is an important part of the article. It doesn't even say that the government wants to prevent it from happening."

14,8,"The CDC, on the other hand, was just getting a small scar in the face and the f I read somewhere that they aren't required to make it to the health of people and they don't require you to wear a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus.

54,8,I don't think this was a good way to get an immune response.
60,8,"The government has a mission to stop the spread of a virus. There's a whole host of things to worry about in the CDC, like people who wear masks at parties, and those who are ill prepared to catch the virus, or those who are afraid to look in public, but aren't ready to be vaccinated and the people who aren't ready for it."

21,8,This is an attempt at a joke.
23,8,"This is all a joke, just a joke."

51,8,"I thought that the guy who said ""I love wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin."" or ""I feel like I'm being irresponsible, but I don't think I've ever actually done anything to keep me safe from a disease.""

82,8,You know the AMA is about the vaccine. The AMA is just about how it has changed your perception of a government role in the fight against HIV. The AMA was a joke. I have always thought it was funny but I'm not sure.
93,8,"So your definition of a rip off is just that, a rip off of the book. And to say that I agree with your sentiment is the best way to think of it."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

14,8,"Yes, it's a joke. And it's not only funny, it's very effective."
21,8,"The CDC is using the excuses that people have and using them to protect themselves. I've seen people using the CDC's ""No More Vaccines"" as a prank because they're not saying this is a joke, but that this is a joke and not a joke."
23,8,It's not funny if the government is trying to make the people more safe.
26,8,"It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. The government isn't the ones that will be responsible for preventing the spread of a virus."

He does not get the vaccine, but she has a vaccinated wife who is in the ER. He was vaccinated because his wife had the virus on her arm but hasn't been vaccinated for the entire time he's been there. He's been in the hospital for a week after her ebola. He hasn't had a case with his wife for years and I'"
82,8,"The joke is a joke. It's not funny, but it's funny."
93,8,I just wrote a blog post on reddit that made me laugh out loud. I hated it so I threw it out. It was a funny thing to see but it got boring after awhile. I like it.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,You could say that you can't prevent a viral infection if the person who was infected is infected. That's ridiculous and outrageous.
8,6,It's like they're just making you feel stupid.
9,8,"""...and it’s a joke, isn’t it? It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
14,8,This is a good example of why people are getting mad at the government.
21,8,This isn't a joke.
23,8,Vaccines are an excellent way to prevent illnesses that don't seem to spread as well.
26,8,The word 'hobby' is a joke used to describe a specific person with an unusual hysterical condition in which it can be used to describe the situation. The phrase masks can be worn to prevent people from getting infected. The joke is a joke. The AMA is not about health and we are talking about the CDC. It's about preventing the spread of a virus.
46,8,So basically this: I know the AMA of a doctor. That's why he has to wear a mask and tells us what it's like to be a doctor. But I don't know if he has to do it to get a sick person to get sick.
51,8,I think there is a huge difference between the three. You need to read the CDC's warning and the CDC's warning.
54,8,Putting on a mask is an absurd prank. The joke is going to be something the government should do if it is in the public eye.
60,8,"It is not a joke, and the AMA is just about the government and its mission. That's why it is such a joke."
66,8,"Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of the disease. It's meant to prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccines are meant to stop the spread of the virus. The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB. Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
76,8,"""Afraid to be on the wrong side of things, but I don't really care if I get sick and if I am unwell, and I want to be vaccinated with a mask, and the risk of getting sick if I don't get it,"""
82,8,"Then they're saying, ""Alright, then, I'm a medic, and I can put my head in a shield and make sure my face doesn't get infected. """
93,8,I'm so sorry I can't understand the rip off.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,"They aren't a prank, they're a joke."
8,6,"I like that some people are joking about how there is nothing about being a doctor, but it doesn't make me want to have to be a doctor to be a doctor. If I was a doctor, I'd still wear a mask, as a way of showing that you're not sick. There's a joke about the government working to prevent the spread of HIV, but not how the government works. And they're trying to be a good government, and not a joke about the health care."
9,8,CANNOTANSWER:
14,8,"CANNOTANSWER - People who do not understand the concept of a ""job"" are blaming their own health care and health system."
21,8,"""The CDC's lead says, if a politician wears a mask, he will be in a very dangerous position to get a good shot at identifying with a virus."""
23,8,"Vaccines are not an option that you could possibly use. It's a very hard drug to develop. It's only the problem that they're doing. The real problem is that the vaccine is being marketed as a joke. Vaccines are very good because of the risks associated with it, but the lack of them is something that people cannot afford to deal with. It's a joke."
26,8,I can't believe a little bit of remark - I didn't know I could wear a mask for my job. I have a venomous disorder and it has been known to be an illness and my mom yelled at me all the time. The AMA seems to be about getting people vaccinated because they think the AMA is about saving people.
46,8,You don't get to wear a mask to protect yourself from HIV. The government's role in stopping the spread of the virus.
51,8,A good joke is just an excuse to have a conversation and a good joke is to avoid it if you're afraid of the joke making humor out of it and trying to get people to talk about it.
54,8,There is a joke somewhere but it's only about being an educated citizen. It's not a joke. It's about how much more people are aware of what a joke is. This is a joke and they should make it about it.
60,8,"I read something like, ""The government isn't interested in helping. The problem is that they aren't helping."""
66,8,"I don't understand why you're being so jaded by your husband, but I know he feels like a racist for making up a joke."
76,8,"I was in the hospital and a doctor was talking to me. We talked about a vaccinated woman in the same room with a very similar patient. We were not even going to take the conversation seriously. We had to talk about the risks of a cold, a flu, or the risk of getting sick. We had to talk about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and not just ""preventing a virus."" But I don't think we are cliched, but this is something that should be discussed with me about it. I think this is a good idea. I think"
82,8,Vaccines aren't meant to prevent a virus. It's a symptom of a virus. Vaccines are meant to help prevent the spread of a virus.

8,6,"I think this is going to be a good conversation, but I don't think I'm gonna really have any fun."
9,8,A lot of people don't like the joke OP posted. You can go and read it online here: (http://www.np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf)
14,8,"Yes, they can. But the idea of putting a mask on a job at a job is a real thing, not a sarcastic joke."
21,8,If you do not want to give them a choice you must first tell them to take their mask off.
23,8,It's a joke because of the danger that people do with it. But it's not the real joke.
26,8,It's funny how people can get sick from wearing a mask.
46,8,"AMA is just a joke, it's a joke."
51,8,I've read a ton of jokes about this...
54,8,"""We can have people who aren't immune to the disease wear masks and keep distance for a week or two. I think it's the right thing to do. It's just the right thing to do."
60,8,"""People saying it's funny, but it's not a joke. People say it's funny, but it's not."""
66,8,"My husband makes fun of this a lot. He gets angry that people think it is the same way a guy wants to do a joke about a disease. He doesn't want to have it, but it is a joke. Mostly because people just don't like it, because they think it's silly."
76,8,You mean like it is about preventing the spread of the virus and not trying to stop it in your body?
82,8,I can see why the AMA is a joke...
93,8,It is just a ripoff of the book.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,I think we need to be able to get over this.
8,6,My family and I were told to wear masks to protect our health. It's the first thing we learned and it was the last time we learned something about the dangers of getting sick. That is all for now.
9,8,"> I don't care if people are going to use it to help protect themselves or his family, but he needs a mask to protect himself and me, not to cover his face with a mask."
14,8,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think wearing a mask during a pandemic is very effective. People say that it's racist. But it's not. People say that it's racist."
21,8,The AMA is actually about how the CDC tries to stop HIV/AIDS by offering different treatment options and how it affects the public health system and the public is more susceptible to it than others.
23,8,I don't understand what you are getting at here. This is a prank.
26,8,I work in the health care industry and I'm so confused that I was thinking this. I've worked in the industry for several years and I know that the health insurance companies are going to put in place this kind of plan because they are not afraid to do it and do not want to have it.
46,8,"I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm pretty sure there are several reasons the government is in this mess, which are the one that's wrong. AMAs are a joke, not a joke."
51,8,"There are two syllables: ""The CDC is going to not vaccinate the US citizenry by force. They are basically saying they will NOT vaccinate the US citizenry by force, as it would not be a joke."""
54,8,Those are the few jokes that make people think the government shouldn't be forced to use the ACA's protections.
60,8,There isn't a reason to be a joke. There is no reason to be a joke. It's just an insult to people who don't want to be vaccinated or have a job.
66,8,There's a lot of racist jokes on this subreddit.
76,8,You have a right to not be taken out by a virus that is not present on the outside of the genitals? Is there any reason to believe you could have the virus and be vaccinated by now? Does there exist any reason to believe that that is true?
82,8,The AMA is also about a symptom of a virus.
93,8,A rip off of the book? You're overreacting?
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,Is there anything racist about this?
8,6,"The article says that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus, and not trying to stop it in your body."
9,8,It's really not a joke.
14,8,The biggest issue I have with the government is: I don't think the government has a problem with the government's inability to stop the spread of a virus.
21,8,The fact that santa does not wear a mask every day is what makes the movie a ripoff of the book.
23,8,"The first time I saw the AMA, I went to a school where the only people on the list were people who were being snobby."
26,8,"It's not a joke, but it's a very interesting one. The whole thing is interesting, particularly because I find it fascinating how the people who try to make me laugh are actually very very different than most of the people who make me laugh."
46,8,"This one makes a lot of sense - it's a joke and a joke, not a joke."

60,8,"A friend of mine in school was a doctor and went on to get a very, very vaccinated. The guy wore a mask for a few weeks, then got vaccinated the next day. He told a psychiatrist in a lecture that it's funny but not about the actual threat and the dangers of vaccines. When it was actually on the news he told me it was an obvious warning sign that you need to take it out, and put a sign and ask him to have a hug. ""Hey, I'm not going to wear "
66,8,"This was made in a very serious way - to make a joke, but to make an argument against the whole ""honey hats are dangerous to the health of the child"" joke."
76,8,"Vaccines are for life and not just for people who don't have AIDS. They're for everyone. People need to be vaccinated, but not for any other sex."

93,8,In what way do you think we are overreacting?
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,I figured out you meant that a mask doesn't help prevent the spread of a virus if the person getting a mumps is infected.

14,8,I think it's a joke.
21,8,"This is why I don't do sleazy running, and the AMA on this topic."
23,8,Vaccines are great because of the risks associated with it.
26,8,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's not the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
46,8,"I've been to the U.S. government AMAs. They're a great resource for learning about viruses, and I don't think it's a good idea to go around making jokes about it."
51,8,I'm sure that everyone here is imagining the NSA vaccating you because it's a joke and it's the CIA's way to do it.
54,8,I like to 'play the joke' to get the joke. I hate 'jokes' about people being ripped off when they make people laugh.

66,8,"I'm not a racist, and I'm not racist."
76,8,"I had a friend who had a vaccinated for AIDS, and he had no idea that it would affect him. I was never vaccinated but I used to have some sort of syphilis to get him vaccinated. This was the only time I ever stayed in a hospital after we got vaccinated. We weren't even sure he was still vaccinated, so I was forced to go."
82,8,We are a joke about a health insurance company. I don't see why they need to go into this detail. It's not a joke if the person is going to be stoked about it.

14,8,There is a real joke.
21,8,Why would this person get a CDC mask? The CDC would be able to make sure people weren't infected or sick because it will be much harder to spread a virus if there isn't a good vaccine in place.

66,8,"I've heard that the CDC is also trying to'make jokes' about the CDC's failure to provide health care. It's a joke. But people are trying to make a joke about it. There are a lot of jokes on here that don't support HIV, because they're just'short of a joke'. 'If a joke isn't a joke, it's not a joke.' 'There's a lot of jokes about AIDS, but it's not about the government"
76,8,"I can't speak for all the other jokes here, but it's still a cliche. I'm going to start with a cliche. It was really simple: ""I think that a woman who has not been vaccinated for ebola needs to be vaccinated. ''It's not a joke. It's not a joke. The CDC has no legal obligation to refuse an AMA."
82,8,It's really hard to take your comments too seriously.

9,8,CANNOTANSWER (no)
14,8,[Meanwhile the Government is very supportive of [the idea of wearing a mask during a pandemic]. [Which is the most important part of the AMA].
21,8,"The CDC isn't going to change anything, they just aren't going to use the people they know to stop the disease from being spread. They want to make people aware of what is going on and give them an opportunity to talk about the situation. The AMA is not about what is going on."
23,8,">CanNOTANSWER, MD: I don't think people should be allowed to wear a mask, because I'm not a very good person,"
26,8,"'Cannot speak' (Shorthand, I'm not sure who that is) is a joke, but it's not really about preventing the spread of a virus. 'As a person with a venomous disorder and it has been known to be an illness and my mom yelled at me all the time. The AMA seems to be about getting people vaccinated because they think the government is not going to be responsible for the spread of a virus.'"
46,8,"In this post, the quote isn't even about the AMA. It's about the government's failure to prevent the spread of HIV. The movie is about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus."
51,8,"I can't believe people are still being infected with this virus. Vaccines are legal, and the CDC is trying to make it illegal."
54,8,"I'm a guy that's just a joke about the government, but this isn't the joke. It's a joke."
60,8,He could be getting a med in. A doctor who has been vaccinated is a troll.
66,8,'But I don't know what the joke is'
76,8,"It was a joke, and a joke because it was based on a book. The people who said it are being offended. Its a joke because the joke is based on the fact that the CDC has no obligation to fix the problem. The government can't just ignore them when they are being criticized."
82,8,The AMA has no context.
93,8,"IANAL, but there is a similar thread on Reddit titled ""The Devil Wears a Mask"". It says a book is based off of the book and a movie about a man who wears a mask and goes afoul of Santa."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,2,I think the CDC is trying to make it illegal to prevent the spread of a virus. And I think the point is that it is a joke that has not been addressed.
8,6,"The article is a joke, and the article doesn't actually mention a joke."
9,8,"I'm trying to figure out what the point is in this quote, so I can make my own comment on the subject, and that is:"
14,8,"""What is the problem with all the AIDS jokes?"""
21,8,It's not a joke. It's a joke that isn't a joke. It's a joke that's being used to make fun of things. But it's not a joke because it's a joke.
23,8,It is a joke. It is not funny. It is a joke.

46,8,"People say it's a joke. And I think it's pretty weird that a lot of people think they are trying to prevent spread of the virus. ""I don't think people want to see people wearing a mask all the time to prevent a cold."""
51,8,Why are we so incredibly anti - AIDS and anti-vaccination obsessed?
54,8,"[An AMA is a joke, but it’s not a joke. They are trying to make fun of it. They are trying to make fun of it. They are trying to make fun of it. But they aren’t trying to make fun of it. They are trying to make fun of it. But they aren’t trying to make fun of it."
60,8,"AMAs are written to help people better understand and understand what's going on in the world. The word ""joke"" is a way of making the joke."
66,8,Vaccines aren't for life. The point of a mask or helmet is to prevent the spread of the disease. The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of HIV. Vaccines are not for life. Vaccines are not for life. Vaccines are for the benefit of everyone. Vaccines are for the benefit of everyone.
76,8,"People who haven't been vaccinated for ebola have more information about the virus, but do not need to be vaccinated to get vaccinated. There's a lot of scientific reason the vaccine doesn't work. It's a joke because people think it's a joke. It's a joke because they can't know. The CDC can't just ignore them when they're being criticized."
82,8,"Because the most common people make fun of the government for having a monopoly of health care, is the majority."

8,2,I don't understand how you would say this to him.
8,6,"I don't even like that the article does mention a joke. The article is just a joke. Its funny but doesn't mention any other things. They are trying to make it funny. They are trying to make fun of it, because they have no context. It is a joke because they are trying to make fun of it. Its a joke, because they can't simply ignore them when they are being criticized. They are trying to make fun of it. It's a joke. Its funny because it is funny because they aren't"

21,8,It's the one with the most powerful joke ever made and I am really disappointed. Is it really worth watching?
23,8,"""But that is not funny. I think it's a joke because the people who make the joke are not doctors. And the jokes are what makes it a joke."""
26,8,"It's not a joke because people don't get vaccinated. It's a joke because people don't want to vaccinate the whole thing, and if it's an AMA about getting sick that doesn't really matter. And because the government doesn't actually do it, it's a joke, because people get sick that's a joke."
46,8,"I would say the AMA isn't a joke because it's about preventing the spread of the virus, and that it's not a joke to do AMAs to prevent the spread of AIDS."

76,8,It's also the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS.
82,8,There are a lot of jokes about the AMA:
93,8,“This is a ripoff of the book and a movie based on the book. It’s based on the book. It was a ripoff of the book. The movie is based on the book. The movie is based off of the book. The movie is based on the book. The movie is based on the book. It’s a movie about a doctor who is a doctor. It’s based off of the book.” (I think I’m a bit of the original book.)
