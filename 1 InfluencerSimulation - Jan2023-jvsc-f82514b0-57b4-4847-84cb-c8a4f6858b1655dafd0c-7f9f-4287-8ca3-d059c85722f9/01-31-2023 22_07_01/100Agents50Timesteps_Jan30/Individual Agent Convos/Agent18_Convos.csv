76,18,"Wearing a mask can help prevent an infection but will make you unable to manage or adapt to the vaccination. This is something that CDC needs to address. They don't have the authority to make a law against the transmission of the virus, but they have the power to prevent it."
78,18,"I think the whole idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight. It seems the idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight. People wear masks to stay in the habit, not to get sick. It's a good excuse for being too busy for it. Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."

It's not an easy thing to get vaccinated. Vaccines and meds are not the only things that may help in recovery. If you can't get vaccinated, you need to find a doctor with a doctor.

18,14,"I'm so sorry, but I am a public health professional in a school. It is very hard to stop an HIV pandemic if you don't wear a mask. If you don't like the way you see it, I'd wear a mask. Sadly, I am so sick and I'd just not have a mask at all."
23,18,"He was actually actually joking about that part and it's pretty obvious that it is a joke and has nothing to do with the vaccines. But as another poster pointed out, this isn't the only vaccine that can help you. It's not a cure, it's an emergency. It's a vaccine to combat the spread of infectious disease.

76,18,"There's a lot of good advice here. If you're using the CDC as an example, I recommend checking the CDC website to see if they are willing to make an effort to help you prevent the spread of the virus. The vaccine is so bad, it's useless. It's all the CDC has to do."
78,18,"It's pretty clear that the government does not want to take responsibility for any disease because people are infected. But if you’re not infected, it’s the government."

48,18,I don't get why people are upset about him being asked to wear a mask.
55,18,"""We are talking about the issue of people who are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two."""
56,18,It's the CDC who made that AMA. I would be very disappointed if they allowed a doctor to use his shit to be a lawyer. He's been in the country for 10 years and his wife is so disgustingly disgusted. The fact that he did that is part of why he's blatantly lying about it or anything.
60,18,"Well, yes, we can have a joke. But if you don't want to be the jerk, then stop and be serious."
76,18,"Is there anything in the article stating that a mask would not stop people with HIV from getting their vaccine, or is there anything in any way suggesting that the CDC needs to do something about it?"

60,18,"I mean... this is like saying you don't want a hat.... you're a jerk, right? You should've told him. But that's not what the article is saying. He's using a joke."
76,18,That doesn't make sense. This isn't the kind of thing that you get in a doctor's office. The only person you can get to put on a mask is your doctor and you need to get them to send a mail to them. Is that what you want?
78,18,You need to re read the title to understand that this isn't just a joke. You need to have an op's perspective and the op's perspective on his quote. You need to understand that the op is referring to a fact of the book.
89,18,This is the most common way to keep your face trimmed and in the proper shape for the virus. The only reason it's so prevalent in my country is because of the health and safety concerns around masks.

18,7,"It's been 10 years since I was diagnosed with AIDS. I volunteered at a CDC, went through all the adolescent programs, and then took some seriously. This was back in 2012 and I did the research that suggested that it's a lot easier to put your face on the ground or in a pocket. This is what my family did for me when I got to work in the fall. It wasn't until years later that I started to realize how many years of medical care I'd be taking me out and trying to tell the truth about it, and the"

18,14,"Well, it doesn't matter if it's a joke or not, unless it's a joke that explains why they say things like, ""We're talking about the issue of people who are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two."""
23,18,I can't believe I'm here now. My son is a doctor and his mother went to a doctor's appointment to get a vaccine. And now I've been wondering if it would help her recover from a pandemic...
38,18,"And in my opinion, there is nothing funny about that. What you're saying is that a lot of the information that you have is very wrong."
45,18,There is a difference between a joke and a joke. This is a joke.
48,18,I think the AMA article says that there are some other people who get into these kinds of pranks.
55,18,"It's like a ripoff of a book - the government makes you wear a mask to prevent illnesses. Until people stop doing it, it's not funny to them."
56,18,"I'm sorry, but it was a very, very small attempt to get people to understand that the CDC is using the medical knowledge of the health department to bring a patient with TB to the hospital in a medical mask, and that the vaccine is going to prevent it from spreading to other people, which is a very big no. The CDC did make this AMA and has now been a huge success. It's a shame he had to do so."
60,18,I've never even seen it. That's really crazy.
76,18,This is the first time I've ever heard someone say that it is about a vaccine.
78,18,"It is a joke about using a mask. You don't want to be sick, but it can help prevent infections and save your life. Its a joke about using a mask when you don't want to go to the hospital."
89,18,I think the issue here is that the health authorities have a very strong claim to power and they don't want to deal with the health risks associated with wearing a mask.
18,3,"[Women in public schools are given vaccinations at least every 5 minutes]. They're an inexpensive way to keep your face from getting sick, and it's a bit expensive to have the disease taken care of. They don't pay for it, so they wear masks to stay warm while they're out. The CDC is not going to do any other such thing, because they're a medical requirement of the government."
18,7,"This is so sad that the guy took a second to put his hand under a mask, and his eyes were gone for 10 minutes while he was talking about a disease he was defending with his name on the title. I think it's a bit of a ripoff of the book that the CDC is trying to make people understand that the government is making you wear a mask to prevent illnesses. But, it is a joke, right? The CDC makes you wear a mask for the sake of health. This is what happens when you are being a joke."
18,9,I've seen more and more people in the CDC/CDC AMA than in this one:
18,14,...which is really a good thing to have.
23,18,"In the books, the CDC is only slandering people for their use of the vaccine, not their misuse of it and attempting to make a joke. Vaccination is a medical requirement of the US government and you can't get a vaccine at the same time as being a joke."
38,18,There's no such thing as a joke.
45,18,"'As a woman, I can tell you that this is an awesome post. It was posted as part of the US AIDS program in 2009 and they have been a massive help to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
48,18,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,18,"There's a lot of nonsense in this thread. What's funny is when someone writes a piece about an actual problem, or is trying to do the wrong thing in an actual problem. Like the government making a mistake or stumbling upon the truth."
56,18,"This is the kind of thing that people are confused about. I'm actually a lawyer, so I understand a lot of people in the post."
60,18,"> ""I think it's funny that you read the title, but I think it's funny. Because the government doesn't want to have the health of their family protected."""
76,18,"It's not about the vaccine, it's about the treatment of the disease."
78,18,It's a joke. It's a joke.
89,18,I think it's funny that the CDC and the CDC are in a similar place.

23,18,You're assuming this is what the AMA is about?
38,18,I've had some very weird conversations about what the mask does to a person I knew. It's very funny how it makes you feel like you have to be very close to an unknown person to be safe.
45,18,"I am not a politician, but I have a job. It sounds like I'm making money and I'm also not interested in the health care industry."

55,18,'I think it's a great idea to do it. We need to take care of everyone as well as the world at large and let it shine through. I want to see the first season of season 2.'
56,18,There's literally no reason why anyone would put on a mask if it wasn't on the market.
60,18,I'm pretty sure this is one of those jokes that's funny about the government enabling people to wear masks. It's a really good idea to put on a mask and bend over and then not a joke.
76,18,"I'm not saying that I like to think he's being cliche, but what he's saying is that the CDC doesn't have the authority to make a law against the spread of the virus. I mean, they do have the power to stop the spread of the virus. This is the most recent of many cliches that seem to have surfaced since the beginning of time. You're the one who is being cliche."
78,18,"In this case, the CIA has nothing to do with the fact that people aren't allowed to wear a mask to protect themselves. It's just that the government has no ability to do it because it is a narcissistic, religious organization that is going to abuse everyone's right to do it."
89,18,The only reason I wear a mask is because of the health risks associated with it.
18,3,"There are some good questions here, and it really shows how much we hate the CDC. We do like our pranks."
18,7,"They are talking about a joke about a viral infection. They are talking about a virus that will spread through a virus and possibly a woman's heart, so the CDC has no right to make them do it."

18,14,It's a joke.
23,18,"The doctor who wrote it was probably referring to the actual vaccination, not the mask."
38,18,"This is a sarcastic joke, not a prank."
45,18,"""Way to protect your friends and family against AIDS and other diseases while I wear a mask."""
48,18,It's not a joke. The only thing that makes it funny is that the AMA is written in a way that people think the government is going to have a serious fight with them.
55,18,"I am going to have to say that I will not accept the fact that you're making it a joke, but that the question I'm asking is the question of ""What about people who don't want to wear masks?"""
56,18,>In the end the medical issue is the right of the person to wear a mask if it wasn't on the market.

78,18,Vaccines are for life. But there is no other reason to prevent people from getting vaccinated if they are not infected. They are a joke.

23,18,I think the only reason the government is doing something as funny as this is because people are ignoring what the real problem is.
38,18,I'm afraid we should be trying to stop the spread of the virus - to the extent that it's dangerous.
45,18,Is this a joke?
48,18,It's not funny if you get infected with a virus.

56,18,This is like calling a joke about the fact that you're not a doctor.
60,18,I think it's an insult. It's just an insult that people are going to be dicks about.
76,18,So you think this is being a political thing? We're not. What's the point of it? The people that make this stuff.
78,18,"Vaccines are for life, if you don't know."

56,18,The entire post is about the fact that the CDC did not make an AMA and they are trying to make a joke out of it.
60,18,"I'm actually not saying it's a joke, just that it's a joke, but a very good joke."
76,18,This is probably why people on Reddit do not look at the topic a lot.
78,18,"Vaccines are for life, but there are other ways to prevent it if you're not infected."
89,18,It's funny that people are going to take the risk of getting sick or having the flu and think that's a joke because they don't need a mask or it's a joke.
18,3,I don't see a problem with the CDC. They're trying to do something stupid but not illegal that does not violate the law.

48,18,I don't understand why people are upset about him being asked to wear a mask because it's so obvious. I think he's implying that people will be stupid enough to get infected.
55,18,"the government is supposed to stop a virus. The problem is that people don't want to wear a mask because people sneeze in public. They don't want people to come to the realization that they're going to be victimized for being able to get their hands on their face and have their hands shaved. The government's ""protective measures"" aren't meant to prevent the spread of a virus. ""The problem is that people don't want to wear a mask because people sneeze in public."

78,18,There are more effective vaccines than just just being a patient - a bunch of people who get a lot of sick from masks.
89,18,...that petty joke is not really relevant.

18,9,"I'm a doctor, but I've lived in the US for almost 20 years."
18,14,"The CDC's attempt to make a joke is completely unfounded, and frankly the only thing it's making is a joke. The government's attempt to make a joke is almost a complete failure, and the fact that it was made with ""no"" in mind is an excuse to do something."
23,18,"I think this is a really interesting comment, I actually like it."
38,18,The AMA is a joke. You know it isn't about the public and you are on the internet reading it?
45,18,"As an AMA member, I can say that the CDC is doing a great job of making people aware of their options to get sick, especially in the U.S. The AMA is satire. The NSA, in all its formative years, has been working to reduce the number of people who use them, including children, mainly in the U.S. The AMA is satire."

76,18,"What about ""I don't know if I'm being a cliche""?"
78,18,I see no reason to believe that he wrote a joke about how his job is to get someone to pay for vaccines.
89,18,The point is that the CDC is putting too much pressure on the health officials to help prevent their fads. They are trying to take this to the extreme. I believe it would be a petty joke that the CDC was talking about.
18,3,"The point is that the CDC is trying to create a virulent infection, not just some shit 'til it explodes'. The government is trying to make a joke out of it. The CDC is trying to make a joke out of it."

48,18,"AMA: In this case it would have been a better fit for a comical AMA, than for an actual AMA."

76,18,"Yes, a mask is for the benefit of everybody."
78,18,It has become a very popular thread with anti-vaccine supporters.
89,18,I've been around masks for about 20 years. I feel like there's a real connection between them and people who can't make a joke and want to avoid a joke. They are trying to take this to the extreme.
18,3,I don't really think people understand the need for the mask. Rather they just don't like the idea of getting a prank out of it.
18,7,Are you talking about the part of the movie that gets me on to the subject of AIDS?
18,9,I think it's funny because he's gonna get sick. He was just saying he's not going to have to worry about his health.

48,18,"It's not about what the person wearing it is going to do, it's about how it's funny and what a joke is about the person wearing the mask."
55,18,"i dont think it's a joke, or any joke at all."
56,18,It's not funny at all. It's just a joke. The CDC does not make an AMA because the person who is the joke isn't a doctor. It's a joke.
60,18,"As a patient who has had an AIDS diagnosis, my apologies if I've been infected with one."
76,18,You think they have to take an action for the sake of being infected? I've been there.
78,18,"Vaccines are for life. They can stop a disease, but only if you're not infected."
89,18,People are not allowed to wear a mask because of the risks associated with it.
18,3,"If you go on a prank in a public place that isn't a joke, I'd say it's funny, not illegal."

18,9,"I was going to add that I have a long way to go before it is a joke. I'm not really into jokes, but I have a lot to say."
18,14,"It's not about the vaccine. It's about the vaccine, not the people who are being infected."
23,18,I like your voice. But what are the pros and cons of having the vaccine at all? Do you really think the government is going to stop that?
38,18,"I think he's missing something. There are some really bad jokes on there, but this is just the idea. The headline is misleading."
45,18,It is a joke. A joke.
48,18,"I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase 'What a joke', ""A prank"" because you don't understand what it means?"
55,18,I think it's a great idea to do it. We need to take care of everyone as well as the world at large and let it shine through. I want to see the first season of season 2. I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two.
56,18,"As a lawyer, I know you need to keep your mouth shut. You're trying to cut off some of the people who want to get vaccinated and are asking why you're not getting vaccinated."
60,18,AMAs are a popular way to start a conversation. They're pretty funny and they don't require a medical opinion. The general etiquette of an AMA is that they're not about the government doing anything to prevent a disease. It's a kind of joke that people use in a joke to push the issue to the point where it's not actually a joke.

18,14,'People like to play the joke. People like to joke about people.
23,18,You're right a joke is a joke because of its sarcasm.
38,18,> I think we all need to wear a mask when we aren’t going out. They’re intended to help people get vaccinated. It’s about the government making the government do good in dealing with the spread of the virus.
45,18,I've had to go through about 25 and I am now getting it wrong.
48,18,AMA: Isn’t that part of the joke about the government? It’s about the fact that people do it because the joke is about the government.
55,18,It's not a joke.
56,18,It’s a joke. But it’s not the joke....It’s the joke. A real joke is a joke. A real joke is a joke. A real joke is a joke. A real joke is a joke. It’s useless and I hate it.
60,18,I've had an AMA about preventing the spread of an AIDS infection.
76,18,"The only way to stop the spread of the virus is if you wear a mask, but you have to get it. You don't have to put on a mask in public. You don't have to have to be a doctor to get it for free, because you are sick."
78,18,I don't really get why you're upset about this.
89,18,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
18,3,I see a lot of humor in this.
18,7,"Yes, it's a joke. And the headline is misleading. And 'I feel like the title of the post explains why this book is a joke."
18,9,I think people should have a way to describe a joke to the CDC.
18,14,AMAs are about how the government is trying to achieve a certain goal.
23,18,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
38,18,"I've been working as a septicologist for six years, and I can tell you this is about the government and not the people I have a relationship with. I'm a doctor and i can tell you that people are a bit scared of the government."

48,18,A troll can't be a joke. A troll can be a joke.
55,18,I'd rather wear a mask and a mask than have the AIDS virus spread by an airstrike.
56,18,"''A real joke is a joke, a real joke is a joke. But there's a real joke is a joke."
60,18,"There is a lot of funny things about the government, like it's part of a joke, as in that it's not a joke. That's pretty much the AMA (aka AMA for ad hominems), it's about the government and the government is able to provide a cure to a disease."
76,18,"A lot of people are referring to it as the only way to prevent infection, but it is just another term."
78,18,"A lot of people with AIDS are allowed to wear a mask, because that makes them sick. But they aren't being treated like they aren't. So it's very clear that the government is wrong."
89,18,"I don't think you can see the big picture, but if it's just the problem. A lot of people want to know what to do, but if they can't, then that's their fault."
18,3,I think people can appreciate a good joke as the only way to prevent the spread of the disease and even be able to appreciate the joke. The joke can’t really be a joke and the joke can be a joke.
18,7,Is this the only AMA?
18,9,The AMA is a joke about the government and not about how they are trying to help people with HIV. It is just a joke. The AMA is not about the government but about the people who are trying to spread it.
18,14,"CANNOTANSWER, MD argues that the government is able to give people and their families a fair chance to get HIV, regardless of how they are treated."
23,18,This is not a joke.
38,18,"I'm not sure what you mean by that. I think it's a joke about the government doing good, and it's not a joke about the government. It's just a joke about the government."
45,18,"'Making a mask in public. The CDC has a gimmick on hand to stop people from getting sick. If someone is sick enough to get tested, they will do whatever they can to help prevent that.''' ""It's funny, but it’s a joke."
48,18,i agree with you - and i agree - but i don't think that it's funny to wear a mask or a prank. i just don't like people asking for help.
55,18,"[In the article he talks about wearing a mask in a group setting and preventing AIDS. It's not really a joke, but a joke. The ""real"" joke is about the CDC and the CDC as a group and it's just a joke because the government needs to stop. It’s not really a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke, but a joke. It’s not really a joke. It’s a joke."
56,18,"I know you hate this guy, I just feel like I am getting what I'm doing wrong."
60,18,What's the best thing that can happen?
76,18,"This sounds like a very reasonable reason for a joke. Its not a dick joke, it's just an excuse for a joke. I can imagine a CDC employee joking about something like this. Its ridiculous. They make a lot of stupid jokes about it because of the government. CDC is just a little bit of a hypocrite, but they are making it ridiculous because people like him are getting sick. That's why they're so cruel, like I said."
78,18,"The CDC is a narcissistic, religious organization that is going to abuse everyone's right to do something. That's a great way to handle the situation - if there's any reason for that, you can simply tell the rest of us that this has nothing to do with the government's actions, a government is not going to use a CDC... a government is going to abuse everyone's right to do something."
89,18,"People have a tendency to wear them. The reason is because people wear them to keep their skin protected. The reason is because people haven't noticed how much sickness is linked to them, or because of the lack of a vaccine."
18,3,... but they don't have a prank to come up with a joke.
18,7,I think this is what's most common in many white people.
18,9,"''Hey, if you don't wear a mask, i wear a mask when I run. i think there's a big difference, but i feel it's a big difference.""''"
18,14,"The CDC has a policy of not providing vaccines. If you don't think you're safe, fuck the CDC. I'd be lying to the kids. And they're not ok with it, the kids aren't allowed to wear masks."
23,18,It's a joke. It's an emergency vaccination. Vaccination is a medical requirement of the US government and you can't get a vaccine at the same time as being a joke.
38,18,I would say that the fact that the AMA is a joke about the government is misleading.
45,18,They are not threatening health care for every sick person and the fact that the people who need a vaccine are not able to get to the center of it.
48,18,There is actually some evidence to suggest that AMAs and jokes on a lot of the other subjects are going to make a real difference in what people say and see.
55,18,"I think the joke is about the CDC, which is trying to stop a virus. That is what the CDC is trying to stop. It's a joke because the CDC isn't going to stop it, but they're trying to stop it, that's what it's about. It's a joke because they're trying to prevent it. But you can't just say that it's just a joke because it's a joke, that's why it's a joke, a joke. I've seen lots of people"
56,18,">I feel like I'm getting what I'm doing wrong. I'm not a lawyer, and I've worked as a lawyer, and I have a lot of people who think wearing a mask is stupid. It's not funny at all."
60,18,"People can be infected with the virus with their mask, but that doesn't mean they aren't going to stop them."
76,18,Using cliches is a great way to avoid them. I think a few people have already agreed that it's not a joke. I'm not sure why it's not a joke.
78,18,"You can stop a virus in a hospital when you are sick, you can stop it when you are sick, you can stop it if you are not infected. Vaccines are for life. But there is no other reason to prevent it if you are not infected. Vaccines are for life."
89,18,There's a huge difference between a joke and a joke. Unless you think the joke is a joke then the joke is a joke. Unless the joke is a joke.
18,3,"The fact that the CDC is trying to make a joke that will be hilarious and possibly make others laugh will probably cause them to come up with it. Whether it is a joke or a joke at all, the problem is the CDC is trying to make a joke and it isn't going to solve it. I would say that it's a joke and that it is funny and a joke because a joke is stupid and a joke."
18,7,"I don’t understand why the guy didn’t mean to be facetious, as he’s a pedophile."
18,9,"I believe the AMA was intended to make fun of someone who's joke was ""I don't have a mask, I have no way to go to the CDC if I'm wearing it. I've been around the CDC for 20 years and it was just a joke."""
18,14,This joke is funny because the government is threatening to revoke the rights of individuals and children who would otherwise be harmed. It's a joke because it is about getting a vaccine. The CDC doesn't seem to care that everyone is being abused.
23,18,It's not a joke. It's a joke. You can't get a vaccine at the same time as being a joke.
38,18,"""This is a sarcastic joke"""
45,18,"A bit in the same context as a joke. The AMA, on the other hand, is about the CDC and the government. The AMA is about the government and the government. This is a joke."
48,18,"I'm just joking, I don't think you can have a problem with it."
55,18,CANNOTANSWER is one of the only people who doesn't get the joke.
56,18,"""An AMA AMA is a joke. I believe that the CDC has no official policy regarding preventing TB."
60,18,"""Meet the man with a mask and I’ll bet he’ll be infecting me with a virus with his mask and he’ll be infecting the whole world with my virus."""
76,18,>I think it's really disturbing that it is so blatantly implied that there is a certain level of risk of spreading the virus. What's the real reason for the fear in the US? I think this is just a joke.
78,18,...and I don't think I can find any other way to say anything.
89,18,"I've always wanted to see how some of the jokes were interpreted when I was younger. I have not found anything funny about this one in particular, but I can't."
18,3,So the message is: Vaccination is for life. People just have to be kind to people. It’s a bad thing if you’re in public place.
18,7,"No. The joke itself isn’t a joke, it’s a dissenting opinion, and I’m not saying it’s a joke. I am saying this is something I can get behind."

23,18,I have no idea what this is about. I just thought that a lot of people on here are still slurring the government into thinking a CDC or CDC article was a joke or a joke. I had no idea the CDC had such a huge problem with the vaccine. Whether it was actually a joke or not is all up to the people who were making a joke about it. Isn't the CDC a med and is it a joke?
38,18,It's an interesting exercise about people needing to know how to be smarter. That's what AMA is about. You're thinking of an AMA about the government trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
45,18,"That joke was not a joke, it was a joke. I think that a good part of the joke is that this was a joke. The joke is about the government, not about the CDC. The AMA is satire and the AMA is about the CDC. The AMA is about the CDC and the government. The AMA is about the government."

18,7,"AMAs are used in an ongoing conversation with doctors about what their jobs are, why and how people should be informed about vaccines. They are intended as a way to help people to learn what their jobs are in the real world and the best way to protect themselves from getting sick and if they have a problem - it isn't a joke.
