93,36,"It's been a long time since I remember it. In Canada, the first two years of running was when santa and santa first started putting the mask on. They used it for so much more than just a long run. Then when santa was finally done he put on the mask and put on the mask."
93,39,I don't think this would work for you :-(

93,71,People wearing a mask on a run is the biggest misconception.
93,78,The joke is that you know what you are doing and can not do it because you are being taken advantage of. That's what makes a good joke.

93,5,It is the best excuse I can think of. What's the point in wearing a mask? That you feel like you're being taken advantage of and you think he isn't.
93,8,"The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they're doing something like 'Mom'. It's been a long time since I remember it."
93,10,"A couple of my friends say that this is a good idea. Several have mentioned they're ok with wearing a mask because of their weight, but they haven't figured out how to avoid it."

93,34,Its very possible that you don't have to wear a mask to prevent a virus. But for a santa to wear a mask and get a run is very different. Its a joke about being taken advantage of.
93,36,It's a good joke but it doesn't change the fact that a santa doesn't wear a mask at all.
93,39,Is that just a joke? :P
93,43,"The way it's used, it doesn't necessarily mean it's true."
93,44,There's some very tame facts on this sub:
93,51,"OP has said the thing ""the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat. The word mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

93,64,I've seen a lot of people wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
93,69,"So, I'm really trying to make a joke..."
93,70,[This was the only way I could imagine santa doing a run.
93,71,A very old joke and a new one at the same time. But one is that when people wear a mask they are taking advantage of a joke because of how it is funny and it makes them feel good.
93,78,>I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
93,83,""""" I want to see you walk on a trail, you're going to die!"" ""Waring a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
93,84,"It's not like he is putting his hands on your face / they aren't so fast. They are putting on a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,85,"There are a lot of misconceptions about this, especially in a world like the United States."
99,93,> Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,5,"I think this post was probably meant to sound funny, but it's still a very popular joke."
93,8,"I believe that I should not have a laugh. I like the joke, but that's just the way it is."
93,10,"There are a lot of misconceptions about this, especially in a world like the United States."
93,16,"I think they are using a bunch of old jokes & the internet to tell us what they are saying, but I don't think they're right."
93,17,I think you're really trying to make a joke. I guess I just want to be eloquent and concise.
93,21,"I mean, the fact that santa does not wear a mask on a run is not going to change the fact that he is a joke. He's not doing it to make people think about themselves and they can do better."""
93,27,What a good joke. You need to put out a whole shit load of words.
93,33,"I think that a ""Mom"" joke is pretty accurate."
93,34,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of a funk."
93,36,I've heard people describe a few things I've observed in this sub:
93,39,"That's not a joke, it's a joke."
93,43,Well if you think about it the reason people wear masks is because of a lack of wear and tear. So it's not a joke.
93,44,"I think this is not the right response to the current situation in the US, but this is a funny one that isn't a joke."
93,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,52,"I don't see a joke in the OP. I don't understand why some of the people wearing masks are so quick to get hurt. I mean, if it was a joke like this, I'd be so angry at the person who made the joke."
93,55,Yes it is. We have to keep it real.
93,62,"It's probably not the best joke you've ever heard. The jokes that everyone uses is about being taken advantage of, and not that you're not."
93,64,"OP's a joke, and I'm making a joke. I can't believe that this is not the actual situation."
93,69,That's a sarcastic joke.
93,70,"If you're not really trying to make a joke, it's about trying to make a joke."
93,71,It's really an old joke. I thought you were saying that if santa was wearing a mask and got into a run then he would have done that at least 10 minutes before it was noticed.
93,78,I can't imagine a santa walking on the trail. I would prefer that.
93,83,"I know some people with a sense of humor who can not be trusted with a joke about a virus. The problem is that santa's face looks like a virus, whereas a mask is a joke about being taken advantage of."
93,84,This is what people often do. I think people are being dicks for wearing a mask. A running mask isn't something I could wear for running. Mostly because they want to think I was the only person who did it.
93,85,I've seen a lot of people wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
99,93,"I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."
93,5,"OP is the best version of this story. He is doing a lot of things for the family to help with the ""suspects"" which was a lot of things for a lot of people to do. He's doing a LOT of people for him so that he can help himself. He's doing a LOT of people for him so that he can help himself."
93,8,Its a good joke. We are all just trying to make people laugh.
93,10,OP...you're kidding. This is a real joke that I don't think is funny.
93,16,"People who don't wear a mask on the job get hurt. It's a joke and not real, but it's not a joke."
93,17,"Well, if it was a joke, I'd be so angry at the person who made the joke. Yes it is. We have to keep it real. It's probably not the best joke you've ever heard."
93,21,">If you're not really trying to make a joke, it's about trying to make a joke."
93,27,I would wear a mask.
93,33,It's hard to believe that it's a joke. You're so wrong.
93,34,You have a lot of options but do you have the time? Because I guess you can't.
93,36,"I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus or even a virus is a joke in itself."
93,39,"So, it's a joke, it's not a joke, you're being sarcastic?"
93,43,"I was just going to say, ""I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk."
93,44,I think it's a bit of a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
93,51,You're not being sarcastic. You're making a joke. This isn't an insult. That isn't a joke.
93,52,"This is pretty much the only reason people wear a mask, especially in the'real' world of santa's face."
93,55,I have to admit I don't get what you're saying but I do have a sense of humor. I think I think some people just aren't the most humorous.
93,62,"It's not a joke, but it's a good one. You're not going to get sick, and if you're in a funk, you're going to suffer. If you aren't in a funk, it's going to be very hard to get sick. If it's a funk, then I don't see any reason for it to be a funk."
93,64,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I've never been to a santa and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk."
93,69,"What's funny is the person who says the ""Mom"" joke isn't as sarcastic as you think it is. The jokes you hear about in the comments aren't a joke."
93,70,"This is kind of funny. You imply a virus does not go away, but the person who makes it is not going to be in that funk."
93,71,"There is a good joke in there as well. If someone were wearing a mask on a run then they are putting themselves at risk, a joke can be made, but the actual joke isn't sarcastic. It's about taking advantage of a joke. It's also about the jokes that people make on the run, especially if they're very fast and have no other way of telling the joke."
93,78,I think this movie is funny.
93,83,"I'm saying that this is what I see in this sub, but that's just the way it is. Until you try to make a joke. It's not funny at all."
93,84,My mother has been wearing a mask for years and she's only noticed it when she eats it.
93,85,I'd imagine a good bit of a run is a bit uncomfortable and could involve lots of slaps and a few falls of clothing.
99,93,I think you are just trying to be kind to yourself with your opinions.
93,5,"It was very important for me to say ""I think that it is the best excuse I can think of. What's the point in wearing a mask? That you feel like you're being taken advantage of and you think he isn't."""
93,8,This is a really nice thread – I know it's been posted here for years. I don't think anyone knows what santa is.
93,10,"I mean, I'm the only person who wears masks a lot. So maybe I'm just sarcastic, but you are correct. I don't get why people do this. I don't believe in such an opportunistic attitude."
93,16,"I would like to add that the last two parts of the article make references to the fact that they are all about how people wear masks. It's just how I like them, I really love them. And that I wear a mask in every single run I go. It's so 'as far as I can see'."
93,17,What kind of joke are you saying that's funny?
93,21,I would like to say I like the movie. I'm going to start a new one.
93,27,My mom is in the middle of a run. I think this movie is hilarious and I think he is a jerk. She is in a funk.
93,33,That is a great joke. I would make sure you keep your stance to yourself in order for a laugh to make you think about yourself and you are doing all the right things.
93,34,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk. I think it's a rip off. Like a movie or a fable. I think this movie is funny.

93,36,"I've stumbled on a few of these things, and this is what makes me laugh. This is what I like most about this sub, but I'm going to make sure I understand your reasoning."
93,39,Isn't that a joke that people just do that to take advantage of a joke? What does that say about people who've been to a Santa and the moon?
93,43,"In a lot of ways, I think the question is, are there any things you would call a funk if your mom was wearing a mask? I think there are some things that would make people believe in a funk."
93,44,"I think I saw a piece of this about a girl who was bitten by a cold and was infected with a fever, but I wasn't very surprised. The only time that I noticed it was on a run, it was on the moon."
93,51,I think the joke is kind of funny. Whether the person who made it is correct or not is hard to say.
93,52,I've never heard a santa and the moon run but I have heard their faces are a bit uncomfortable
93,55,"I would wear a mask. It's hard to believe that it's a joke. You have a lot of options but do you have the time? Because I guess you can't. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus or even a virus is a joke in itself."
93,62,"I love the ""Mom"" movie a lot."
93,64,This isn't funny at all. I'd imagine a good bit of a run is a bit uncomfortable and could involve lots of slaps and a few falls of clothing.
93,69,Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I would wear a mask. It's hard to believe that it's a joke.
93,70,"I haven't seen this movie, and I'm just going to say, ""I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus or even a virus is a joke in itself. I think this is kind of funny. If someone were wearing a mask on a run then they are putting themselves at risk, a joke can be made, but the actual joke isn't funny."
93,71,"Well, I just noticed that on a run last week, and the first time I heard it, I had to say, ""Ah, that's funny, I didn't think I could do that."""
93,78,It's not a joke. It's a joke that's funny because it's funny.
93,83,"People who wear masks on a run are just trying to be nice, it's called an ""old joke."" But it's not a joke at all. I mean, I don't want a movie or fable to tell a joke, but I would wear a mask. Especially since it's so bad that people like to make fun of people on the run. Then again, it's the joke, so a little funny, but not the best."

93,16,i think that people on the internet think the mask is a joke
93,17,"Yes, a rip off."
93,21,It's not a joke. It's a ripoff. It's a joke.
93,27,There is no such thing as a mask. If you were in the US it would be a big deal.
93,33,"I like the tumblr caption as well. I love the way it says the characters have to speak, and I love the idea of a superhero with a mask. But I don't like the way they end and the acting. I do not like that the actors have to be very friendly."

93,17,I wouldn't get very close to this and I'll probably just start to laugh about it in a different tone if it comes across like a joke.

93,36,I haven't seen a single rip off of the book. But I think it is a rip off of the book. i have heard a lot of jokes on this sub.
93,39,"I thought a good example of what a rip off of a book was, but then I realized this isn't a ripoff of the book."
93,43,"i think the movie that makes a good movie is funny because i can't imagine going through a funk with it. It's also funny because i hate the book and just go on and watch the movie because i feel like I can't understand why people would want to take a trip to it. it's hilarious, the movie was good but the movie didn't sound like a good book"
93,44,"As an American, I am ripe for the ripoff. And not rip off."
93,51,A lot of people like the book because it sounded like a movie or a fable. People like the book because it sounded like a fable.
93,52,"Is there a point where you think we're having a ""dark"" time?"
93,55,"I've heard a lot of people who wear a mask every day. Some people are ok with the whole ""I do the work well, and he doesn't look like he's too good."" subtext a little. I think the santa joke is pretty cool because that means that there are many different kinds of people who wear hats."
93,62,I'd have to say the best way to end it is to leave your mouth open.
93,64,"I just told you that the movie is ""I hate the book,"" and he said ""The only way to understand it is that it's a ripoff of the book""."
93,69,The movie is a ripoff of the book. It's not a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book.
93,70,"I can't tell if you're being serious or not, but I'm so angry about that. I am trying to figure out what you mean, though."
93,71,The one in the book that came to mind is that it's actually a ripoff of the book.
93,78,"I know some people who love a good joke, but this is how I see the movie."
93,83,"IANAL. I've seen a lot of people who wear a mask on a daily basis, even when they do not feel safe with themselves."
93,84,I don't think the movie is a rip off of the book. It's the book.
93,85,A good bit of a run isn't a joke because it's a joke.
99,93,"> I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."
93,5,I love the way you think.
93,8,I just wrote a blog post on reddit that made me laugh out loud. I hated it so I threw it out. It was a funny thing to see but it got boring after awhile. I like it.
93,10,I've heard that the whole movie is a ripoff of the book and the whole movie is the book.
93,16,"I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."
93,17,"I just laughed out loud at the joke and laughed out loud at the movie, not that I was the one making a joke."
93,21,The only thing that counts is sarcasm.
93,27,I can't stand a good book and I don't like the movie but I think the movie is a rip off of the book.
93,33,"You like to talk about it but you like to talk about it, not what the book said. It's the book, and it isn't a ripoff of the book. It's a joke."

93,36,"That's not funny. I'm ok with it, I just think it's a rip off of the book, and I like the movie."
93,39,I feel like this is a ripoff of the book.
93,43,"I feel like my family would feel funk at some point when I was younger, and I'm in a funk at some point when I was in my early 30s. I think that's exactly how the book is supposed to sound in today's world."
93,44,"As someone who is infected with a virus in the US, I think this is a bit of a rip off."
93,51,I like that the movies haven't just been told to put a 'Hamlet' in the title. The movie was a ripoff of the book. The movie isn't a ripoff of the book.
93,52,"I don't think I'm being serious, but I think that if the ""sold out"" thing is a joke, it isn't a ripoff of the book. I mean, people don't necessarily want to be like that. Unless they're just having a good time with themselves. It's not."
93,55,"I love all the movies that tell a little bit of a ripoff from the book, but I can't make any jokes."
93,62,"My mother is very similar to you. She has been on the train for a while and the santa looks good, but she can't seem to get a std for it. She got out of that by accident."
93,64,So this is a joke? I've seen a lot of people who wear a mask everyday.
93,69,"I'd wear a mask every day, as long as the characters aren't like a bunch of guys."
93,70,I'm not talking about the movie. It's just about how everyone's reaction is to the movie.
93,71,"That's actually pretty wacky, too."
93,78,"They both sound like ripoffs, they don't even exist. They're based on the book."
93,83,"As a guy who grew up wearing a mask, I can tell you I don't think it's fun or a good idea. It's a silly joke."
93,84,"I figured it was a ripoff of the book, and the book."
93,85,I would rather be in the moon when I would wear a mask than have a shitload of friends wear theirs in the abysmal environment iirc.
99,93,"It's kind of ironic that Santa has his head around the'suck' part of his face, and it's so freaking funny that he didn't wear a mask because it was the cloner that had the problem. He didn't realize that he was a clown and he wished he had a helmet and had a suit."
93,5,I've read a LOT of the book as well as many other things that could have been a ripoff of it. And the 'old joke' was an attempt to be funny a little bit.
93,8,I'm so sorry I can't understand the rip off.
93,10,You can always add more words if you think it's a ripoff.
93,16,"There's also the part where the writer says that the ""sold out"" movie is based on the book. He does not mean that it's a ripoff of the book."
93,17,"A lot of the people who do that in the US aren't in the US and in fact, are in the US, but they're generally in the U.S., where a rip off is the more common rip off. I'm not sure I would call a ripoff, but I can tell you that I don't see the benefit of that. I would like to make a better choice if I did."
93,21,>I think that the whole reason for wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,27,"I had a friend that told me about how we'd spend a lot of time out walking with his cat in a bathrobe. She had a bunch of them and she was still laughing. She said that there was a big craziness around her face and that the cat had the ability to go and find the cat. She had no idea there was a spider in the bathrobe. And she kept doing it, and he still wore it because he couldn't stand it because it's not that big of a deal. I drank it like a"
93,33,"In the book, it says that people can see the santa in the hat in the background. It explains why you think a santa would be like you. It's a lot like the book but you can't see him without it."
93,34,"It's a good joke, and a ripoff of the book. The reason you put a 'fucking santa face on a narcotic' in a movie is because of the movie's description. This isn't a ripoff of the book, but a joke that the movie is based on."
93,36,"I think if you have the time, you're going to go shit in the movie."
93,39,"I wear a mask for fun, and sometimes I see a sick character who is wearing a mask. It's not as funny as wearing one, but I think it's also a ripoff of the book."

93,51,"You know, I think it's kind of funny, and it seems like a joke because I just can't help but look at the premise of this comment and not just the fact that you are in a funk."
93,52,So do you have any idea why people make jokes and why not just make them up? Because these are just not true.
93,55,"I'd say ""I am a good artist, and I am glad I can take the time to create my own hat.""."
93,62,I have an allergy to santa's skin.
93,64,The author did a great job putting you at the bottom of this pile of comments on the book.
93,69,I'm a guy who has seen the movies all over the world and I'm really trying to make a joke about this.

93,43,I think this movie is based on the book. But I don't think that's the point.
93,44,You don't know why people make jokes? People make jokes because they're not true. They're not so much because people get sick. You can't have the joke without a santa. I think that's a really good way to put it. The author did a great job putting me at the bottom of this pile of comments on the book. I'm really trying to make a joke about this.

93,5,OP is the best version of the story.
93,8,A rip off of the book? You're overreacting?
93,10,It's ironic that Santa doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

93,17,CANNOTANSWER:
93,21,"I can't tell if you're serious, or not. The fact that santa does not wear a mask every day is what makes the movie a ripoff of the book."

93,33,"It's a rip off of the book, because a lot of people like it."

93,55,"So I think the article isn't as accurate as the book, is it?"
93,62,"I would tell you this too but... This isn't really about the book. This is a real post about the book, not the movie. It's about how the movie ends, how it's about how many people wear the mask every day."

93,69,>I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.
93,70,"Nope. Rather, he wants to make sure that the movie is a rip off of the book."
93,71,"That's a really good line, you're making some great points. You can't be so serious if you don't agree with the article."
93,78,There are a lot of examples of things being ripoffs in the book.
93,83,"I am not an author. I love the book, but I've heard about the movies in general and have heard stories of people who wore a mask, some of whom are funny but really aren't. The books are great, but not the books."
93,84,You are being serious. The author did a great job putting people at the bottom of this pile of comments on the book.
93,85,I think the rip off of the book is the idea of people getting a job while their job is doing good.
99,93,Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
93,5,That's not how you read the whole book.
93,8,In what way do you think we are overreacting?
93,10,"My moms favorite book is ""The Matrix."" She's also one of the best people I've seen play on the show. She says that because she thinks the movie is funny, it doesn't make her really mean. She's a huge fan of the movie, though."

He is not doing it to make people think about themselves and they can do better.""'"
93,27,I'm gonna be a bit harsh on you. I think it's a really good joke.

93,34,I think this joke is incredibly accurate. Like a movie or a fable.

93,43,"So, it's not about the movie but it's about how many people wear masks every day."
93,44,"He's not trying to be a rip off, but he is making the same point - he's not a joke."
93,51,You're not being sarcastic. You're making a joke. Unless you're being eloquent and don't get it - I've said a lot of times.
93,52,The article is in the middle of a story about a guy wearing a mask every day. It is a ripoff of the book.
93,55,It's funny because it has a ripped off a little bit of the book that it is supposed to portray.
93,62,"I'm not an author, but I believe the author was a rip off of the book."
93,64,"If the movie was not about the book then it is the movie. The movie is not about the book, but it is about people shitting each other."

93,85,"In some places, the only reason I want to wear a mask is because I like the idea of not having to wear one in front of my nose and a mask is because I don't like it because it causes an unfunny sense of feeling."

93,5,"I don't know if it's possible to say or write this but I can think of more, like, 3 examples of people who have been in funks since the day after Christmas. This seems a bit silly to me."
93,8,"The way we act in these things is like ""Hey man, rip off of the book""."
93,10,CANNOTANSWER: Is there something wrong with the idea that people are being ostracized by that joke?
93,16,There's a story in a book about how people wear a mask to stop a virus and a man says he doesn't like it because it causes a laughable sense of feeling.
93,17,> I just want to make sure that the funnyness isn't a ripoff of the book. I like to think this is a really good joke. I like to think this is a joke. I just want to make sure that the funnyness isn't a ripoff of the book.
93,21,It sounds like a joke he's trying to make. And then that sarcasm.
93,27,I like to think that this is a really good joke.
93,33,It's not a ripoff of the book. It's a joke.
93,34,I don't think the author was being sarcastic.
93,36,"People should take care of themselves. And also try to get the people who don't wear a mask to run around the world a better life, instead of just giving the people they need a break."
93,39,"CANNOTANSWER: It is kind of ironic that Santa doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The book is good, but it's not about the movie."
93,43,It's like a joke. I don't think this is the way he's being sarcastic. I think it's the way he's making his point.
93,44,"It's not a joke, it's the one that sucks most. It's really a joke."
93,51,"As a narrator who has written a lot of book books, it sounds like a lot of things you have been saying, as a child. Isn't the book a joke?"
93,52,It's a joke. The whole joke is a rip off of the book.
93,55,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,62,"It's not a good joke, it's a joke, and it's not a joke. It's a ripoff of the book and that is why people are called dicks. It's a real, funny joke."
93,64,"Is that the ""tuttle that fucked you up thing"" that I said?"
93,69,"So santa wears a mask every day, because he has a big problem with his head being too big? You'd think that'd be funny, but it's hard to say."
93,70,That's not a rip off of the book.
93,71,This is a rip off. This article is a ripoff of the book.
93,78,"The article doesn't give a rip off of the book, so maybe they could use it as an example."
93,83,"I don't know why you think people are being ostracized, but I do know that the problem is that santa doesn't wear a mask because the person he's wearing a mask with isn't doing the right thing."
93,84,It's a ripoff of the book - which you don't read.
93,85,I think a lot of people think it's funny because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus. I'm gonna be a bit harsh on you. I think it's a really good joke. I like to think it's a really good joke. I just want to make sure that the funnyness isn't a ripoff of the book.

93,5,I was on the front page of the Guardian. Several hours ago.
93,8,"It's a funny story, I think it's funny, and is a joke."
93,10,So the author is the one who decided that that was the way to go.

93,33,"It is possible that the author and the movie are both right to joke about it. Ultimately, the author is the one doing the act. The movie is one of the things that has been in the books to show off the original comic."
93,34,"... I know... there is a good joke on it, but the'sarcasm' is not exactly the one I 'd' like to get, it's that I'd'really' enjoy it."

93,64,...because I'm not a fan of fucking people with the book.
93,69,You can't get enough of these words.
93,70,Is the OP asking for a comment to change his mind?
93,71,"I don't agree with the author's use of the word ""ripoff,"" it makes me question the validity of the joke."
93,78,"They are also ripoffs of the book - the book was not a ripoff, just a ripoff."

93,84,"- I mean, I'm gonna throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool. Obviously it's a ripoff of the book. They rip off of the book. '""I feel like the story is a ripoff of the book."

93,21,"That's not ironic at all. I've also seen the movie, and have no doubt about the joke itself."
93,27,Then why aren't the two people who cited the book in the comic telling you the story from the movie?
93,33,"''But the idea of him being a dick is more about a mask than anything else. So you don't wear a mask and you don't get a job."" ''But the guy in the hat."" ''I love the way they end and the acting. I do not like that the actors have to be very friendly.""''"

93,62,"There is a lot of truth in these words. The writer is trying to play into a myth that is part of the narrative. It is not a joke, it is an act. The OP is right to say it, but it isn't the best thing you've ever heard. The author is not trying to make a joke about the book."
