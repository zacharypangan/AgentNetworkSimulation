    "I can only imagine the pain of this comment. Is it really an issue for me if I have to type this in my head? I can tell you that you could easily make this joke from all the stuff that shits in the book but I can't because the book isn't based off the book.",
    "I don't think you were being serious.",
    "\"I think this is a bit of a rip off, but I think it's a ripoff of the book. The author did a great job putting me at the bottom of this pile of comments on the book.",
    "I would read it if I didn't want to.",
    "In this case, the article is rip off, not a ripoff.",
    "It's a rip off of the book based on the book - based on the book",
    "It's not an article on the book or the movie. It's a book about a book based on the book, so that's not a joke.",
    ".. "
