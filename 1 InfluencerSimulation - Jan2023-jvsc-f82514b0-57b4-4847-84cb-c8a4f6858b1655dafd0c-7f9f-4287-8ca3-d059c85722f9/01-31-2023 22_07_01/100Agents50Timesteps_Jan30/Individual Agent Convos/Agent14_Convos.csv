16,14,"You can sleeve a mask in a public spot in your neighborhood and get vaccinated if you want, and you have a sleeveless mask with you."
18,14,Well there are several types of vaccine that are designed to help combat this virus. They include the vaxxed and vaccines that prevent this kind of disease.
19,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,14,It will be cool to see some things you don't like like wearing a mask in public.
27,14,I'm not that smart about it.

83,14,"You should check out the wikipedia page about this a bit before you go. It tells you you have the oh no, you can do whatever you want when you go."
14,1,You're being a dick. There's no going back.
14,8,That's the biggest issue I have with the government: I don't think the government has a problem with the government's inability to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's time for the government to act and not force people to do things that they don't want to do.
14,11,"People can get vaccinated in small numbers. In fact, there are a number of vaccines to combat a Virus."
14,13,As the guy on this sub says it is:
16,14,"In general, the people in this thread are just as concerned about the government’s power to take control of their own health and to make sure that they don’t have any other personal responsibilities in their lives."
18,14,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
19,14,"As an avid outdoorsman, I've noticed that a lot of people don't wear a mask anymore, especially if they're getting a flu."
23,14,"The only time that I would wear a mask was during an interview with my mom, who says ""I'd prefer to be alone than in the hospital, where I just want to get me to go. I've never been to a hospital, or had to do anything to help them. I need help, a personal med, and I will be right there in front of the doctor!"" The question was: what did she expect? She'd like to know. You might be able to go to a doctor with a doctor."
27,14,"[No, we don't wear masks, they aren't necessary.](https://www.cdc.gov/resources/public-faculty/comments/2sc2ed3c5eds3e/) If he were elected to office, there would be a government oversight bill and you could make that bill work."
39,14,"Wearing a mask doesn't help with the spread of any virus. It's not a positive thing and it's not something I think is a positive thing. Wearing a mask during a pandemic, because that's what they do in this country. That's awesome! I'm actually trying to get this post up. I'm in Florida, and i'm a little embarrassed to be doing this! What kind of food is there to eat, i know they're not all supersprupiaders but I"
47,14,"I just read about wearing a mask. I was told by an official who worked in public health that wearing a mask is considered a form of protection, and that there are people in the public health field that can't afford it. I think I see it as something that a lot of people can actually do. The truth is that we're not talking about that, we're talking about the fact that there is a statewide mandate. That being said, I wouldn't worry about having a statewide mandate, as you are, so I wouldn't worry about that"
48,14,"Y'know, I've never seen that movie before. Do you remember it?"
53,14,"There's a lot of stuff about the mask that would not be covered. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or is a crime, it just means that it is a way to prevent people from getting the disease. And that's the one thing they haven't gotten - they want their citizens to wear a mask, and they don't want their citizens to wear a mask, because their public image is so poor and unhappiness is a real threat."
61,14,So you wear a mask to protect your eyes?
63,14,Yes he meant that he has been sent a message that they should wear the mask at their office and not a mask that they are wearing at their office.
68,14,"The government in Texas is a giant ""spy"" of the problem and there are many places in the nation with no mandate to do this."
73,14,He lied and made a troll post about it on r/legaladvice.
74,14,I'm sorry to break it to you but I still get a scar from my covi cleft palate that if I keep going out on my own is one of the biggest shit in the world.
83,14,"""I am a woman and I wear a mask on the run route in my car."
14,1,"A statewide mandate is a fucking thing. The problem is the country....and we aren't going to go to a fucking doctor. A lot of people will have to do what they want, and it will be much cheaper than a public health emergency. I would wear a mask to stop a virus and still avoid all contact."
14,8,"[(https://www.cdc.gov/resources/public-faculty/comments/2sc2ed3c5eds3e/) Wearing a mask during a pandemic,"
14,11,"There's a link at the top of this r/reddit article called ""Gods will not care."" It's also in the title."
14,13,If you want to get away from this problem I recommend it - and not just because you are in FL - but because you're from the west coast and you're afraid of getting caught in a pandemic.
16,14,We need to be able to stop this virus from spreading. That's why a bunch of states require people to get HIV/AIDS vaccinations. That doesn't mean that the government must prevent this from happening.
18,14,"We are not able to fight off viruses through physical contact, so we must not go through physical contact with the virus (what a bad thing that's)."
19,14,"I have to go to school now because I was too old to wear a mask. I wore a hat and a hat every day. Having no hat and no hat is going to make me a worse person. I've had a severe cold and still have a lot of fun going to school, and it hurts to get the hood up. I feel like I should have a shirt if I could get a new one for Halloween. I don't care how well I feel about it, I'm a man in a mask."
23,14,There are many people out there that haven't been vaccinated.
27,14,You don't know what a government oversight bill is. It's a nice idea to have a mask that's more than enough to get people to think about themselves and they're really the only people that could have done better.
39,14,I've seen it before. OP:
47,14,"""... if you haven't lived with a virus. I can tell you that it's just as dangerous as being shot or burned to death. I'm running a half mile in Florida right now! It's a really good idea. There is a large number of states and states requiring you to wear a mask. I just read about wearing a mask. I was told by an official who worked in public health that wearing a mask is considered a form of protection, and that there are people in the public health field that can't afford it. I"
48,14,"I don't know, but I think it's hilarious that Santa can be a big troll by talking about his medical bills, not his health insurance plans."
53,14,i've had my face shaved twice to stop the spread of my virus. my nose is still shaven from the time it was born
61,14,"I wear a mask to protect my eyes, but I'm embarrassed. It's the worst."
63,14,"You might find the movie more intriguing, but it doesn't get that much traction. The story line is similar and I think the reason people are so happy to see the movie is because the idea is so important, that's why people are blaming them. But there's also a lot of confusion, especially since it's on their head, in regards to the way they are doing it."
68,14,"""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe please leep your mask on"
73,14,"The people of California do not want to take them. The people of Texas don't want to take them, they want to take care of the child that snuck into the world."
74,14,"If you get sick you have to be vaccinated and get your covi cleft palate removed. If you get sick and have a covi cleft palate removed you will have a scar and may not have a covi cleft. It sounds like you've been in the hospital before with a vaccinated friend, and you've been on a diet of colitis. You have a covi cleft palate and you do get the scar. Then they have to be vaccinated and not be vaccinated. I'm"
83,14,Honestly I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
14,1,"I don't know much about how we do things, but I don't think it's the same as if the person is vaccinated or not. It's more like someone is not supposed to know where to get the shit out. It's a bit like what some people are talking about and not really a shit person who is not going to get the shit out."
14,8,I was raised on a statewide mandatory health care provider. He also told me that it was necessary to wear a mask to keep people from getting sick.
14,11,"In my town, there's a group of homeless and homeless people with a hood and a mask that they can wear to stop HIV/AIDS. There's some pretty common ones as well."
14,13,"'As the guy on this sub says it is:', ""If you want to get away from this problem I recommend it - and not just because you are in FL - but because you're from the west coast and you're afraid of getting caught in a pandemic. We need to be able to stop this virus from spreading."
16,14,A bunch of states require people to get HIV/AIDS vaccinations. That doesn't mean that the government must prevent this from happening. I'm a medical student and I am not familiar with the medical issues that are involved in this.
18,14,My brother and I were running together at the time and it blew up and he never got a ticket. He would suck my ass for not wearing a mask and he'd want to relive his days when he went to school.
19,14,I didn't realize this sub was talking about a virus. It's a little out of date. I'm also not sure why people are assuming it's just a joke.
23,14,Is it a secret? Can you come over and get a piece of advice from an AIDS expert to stop the spread of the virus?
27,14,What do you think about the CDC's decision to prevent spread of the deadly disease?
39,14,"This is a joke. They said something about that, not to be misinterpreted. It is part of the AMA that was a joke. They didn't even mention it."
47,14,"""(You don't have a right to an opinion and this is what makes you an elitist idiot."
48,14,I am glad you're getting this.
53,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
61,14,"If you don't like it, you're a bad person. If you're uncomfortable, you're going to shit about yourself. I'm sure that you'll find people who are a little more experienced about the disease, but it's very hard to understand why this is going to be so successful."
63,14,"OP: I have a lot of work experience, and my best friend is in the same situation."
68,14,This is not a joke. The joke is that you don't have to wear a mask or have it on. This is an insult to the government and a way of thinking you don't care about it. You can have a mask on and make yourself feel better.
73,14,"I was born in the US but we were in Texas and it was still very scary to me at the time. We had to have a statewide mask mandate, but we would be able to have him go to the hospital and then we could go and do some shit there."
74,14,Is a covi cleft palate removed a permanent scar?
83,14,I believe in the masked system and the government will do a great job of making the public aware of it.
14,1,Wearing a mask and having a hood around you would probably have to be a very common occurrence among those living with HIV/AIDS in Texas. Its a very common thing to do at the hospital as it will make people feel better but in reality it is not a real problem.
14,8,> I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
14,11,"Honestly, I think I read some stuff a bit and I'm going to omit some of the points you made."
14,13,"AIDS is a scary disease, and it's not a joke. You don't have to have a mask or have it on. There's no real way to stop it, and if you don't want to get it you can't, which is why you can't. The idea is to scar people and make them feel better, but that doesn't mean you can't make them feel better."
16,14,"I think I was the only one to find this humorous. The guy is not really a doctor, it is a lawyer, he just isn't interested in a situation like that."
18,14,"I'm so sorry, but I am a public health professional in a school. It is very hard to stop an HIV pandemic if you don't wear a mask. If you don't like the way you see it, I'd wear a mask. Sadly, I am so sick and I'd just not have a mask at all."
19,14,It's not a joke. It is a fact. This is not a joke.
23,14,Isn't the US government actually putting up with this issue?
27,14,I think you need to put out a whole shit load of words. I think wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is very effective. I mean I've been using a mask for several years Why wouldn't you wear a mask if it helps prevent the spread of a virus? I think you can do it if you're a person.
39,14,"I think the point of the article was a joke and he was a jerk about it. ''I'm pretty sure this is more about preventing someone from getting sick, but also to prevent a potential vaccine causing people to get sicker because a mask is in a bad position. It doesn't make sense to me."
47,14,"That's right, but I think we all know that it is a misstep to put a mandate in place. I do believe that they are putting in place a policy that will prevent a lot of people from using it, but I think they can still protect themselves and their kids with it."
48,14,How can you wear a mask while infected? Does that mean he's not going to need it? Does the santa have to wear a mask to stop a virus spreading?
53,14,"""It's not a joke, it's a joke."""
61,14,"I feel like I'm not a doctor. I can talk about things like a mask, but I'm not an expert. I don't think people are 'fooling' about this, even though they know that they can get shot, but it's a joke and a real good idea. This is an actual joke. It sounds like some people are trying to get their own vaccine, because they think it's a bad idea to be wearing a mask while you walk by a grocery store. I'm not sure what the joke is about."
63,14,CANNOTANSWER A WINNY?
68,14,That's a joke. It's a sexist joke.
73,14,"If he wasn't a pedophile, then yes, a federal mask mandate would not actually protect against HIV. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US."
74,14,That's actually one of the big shit in the world.
83,14,[And you have a bit of a history of wearing a mask on a run route in your car](http://www.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantA Honestly I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.](http://www.fwdr.fl.gov/css/fwdr
14,1,"AIDS is a serious disease and it's a serious threat to people, if you don't want to be in the ER. It is also a big problem because there is a chance that you get to stay sick to a certain degree for an extended period of time because you are a hospital patient. I believe that a statewide mandate is a sexist joke and a sexist joke is a joke."
14,8,"Yes, it's a joke, it's a fact."
14,11,"Well, the headlines are not about a single story, but there's one in particular, where it's a really big deal."
14,13,It's not a joke. The article was meant as a joke but not to deflect an actual message. It's a joke. It is a joke. I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
16,14,"In what way is this a joke, and what can the NSA say?"
18,14,I think you need to know a lot about the upcoming season of season 2.
19,14,"People are making movies about viruses for the wrong reasons, not for the wrong reasons."
23,14,"It's kind of hard to tell if the government really is trying to make the vaccines safe or not, given that we haven't seen a lot of the AIDS epidemic."
27,14,"I think you're just going to need to take some time to really read this one, but I do think it's very funny that you think it's a good idea to wear a mask."
39,14,Vaccines are for life.
47,14,">Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it’s useless and I hate it. I don’t see how you could be trying to help a guy’s mother."
48,14,"It is funny that a fad exists. A prank has to be an attempt to inflict a death or even death on those who are not infected. If you were infected with a disease, a prank will happen. This is why a joke isn't funny. 'Winning a mask in a run is a joke' is a joke, the mascot is a joke."
53,14,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
61,14,'What a joke'
63,14,>CannonanSWER A WINNY?
68,14,"AMA is the most popular media. It’s a form of public health, and it’s been around since the 90s, and has become popular in a number of other countries."
73,14,And he's not saying he wants to stop this?
74,14,">I think that in order to stop the spread of a virus, a mask is necessary. Vaccines are not what the government wants. Vaccines are not what the government wants."
83,14,"I agree with the other one. A lot of the time, it's just about being a joke."
14,1,"I'd wear a mask, even if you haven't seen it. You know how people say that if you were infected with HIV, that it would mean you're gonna get AIDS."
14,8,Afraid that the government doesn't want to have to take all those ad hominem hats on the street to get a real answer.
14,11,"It seems like the NSA is not trying to get something for it, but is more concerned with the safety of the vaccines and its use for being an innocent joke, like I've said before."
14,13,"What the article says is very relevant, for a political discussion about HIV/AIDS."
16,14,'I have a mask on and if that's all I want to wear to my doctor I'll have a bunch of people to show me'
18,14,I'm actually going to go ahead and post this in order to get you to do the first season of season 2.
19,14,"AMA is pretty bad. Its just a bunch of shit, and it doesn't make sense to say it's a joke."
23,14,I just got a second chance of making a joke about Obama and the mask mandate. Its kind of like a ripoff.
27,14,"""This guy is trying to discourage people from wearing masks for christmas What's the joke? If people were not blaming themselves that is a joke. The government is blaming themselves, but they just don't realize that they are blaming themselves. It's just a joke."
39,14,">If it was to stop the spread of a virus, I'd give a fuck. The guy who he was talking to was basically gonna have some naivete to say."
47,14,Why would I wear a mask if my wife was HIV positive?
48,14,So in this case the prank of Santa wearing a mask is a joke?
53,14,"CANNOTANSWER: I've had my face shaved twice to stop the spread of my virus. My nose is still shaven from the time it was born"", ""It's not a joke, it's a joke."""
61,14,People can get the flu but the government just wants to whack it away by not trying to protect their own health.
63,14,"I know the name, but I don't remember reading anything that actually mentions the word. I mean, you can wear a mask to stop spreading a virus. That's all a joke."
68,14,"I've always wondered if the government just put a lot of emphasis on the gov't's failure to protect children, as if it was a joke."
73,14,"statewide mask mandate, which would not be used to protect against HIV."
74,14,"I think you're just being silly. ""Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think a lot of people are just being silly. The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on. Those that don't realize they are wearing a mask, are so embarrassed by it. You can't just go off on a whim, you just want a good feeling"
83,14,Vaccines are legal. And they aren't required.
14,1,"It seems like the NSA is not trying to get something for it, but is more concerned with the safety of the vaccines and its use for being an innocent joke, like I've said before."
14,8,So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves.
14,11,"I am not saying that you are not being silly. I am saying that the issue with the statewide mask mandate is a joke. I don't believe the AMA is about how much people want to wear masks in order to prevent people from getting HIV, and that the government doesn't have any say in what their vaccines will do."
14,13,It is a joke. It doesn't make sense to say it's a joke.
16,14,I just read the title and felt I was the only one to find this hilarious.
18,14,What a good guy he is! It sounds like he has a pedo rash and can't really live with it.
19,14,"Is the AMA a joke? AMA isn't a joke, it is a fact."
23,14,A joke is a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
27,14,"The first line of a very well written post about this is, ""It's kind of funny that you think it's a good idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" It goes something along the lines of: ""Is this guy the one that needs a mask to prevent the spread of a deadly virus?"
39,14,"I'm pretty sure it was the same thing. I just felt like I had to read this all through, in a really simple way."
47,14,A lot of things in this post aren't the same thing.
48,14,It's been a lot of time since this post.
53,14,A guy is a dick. That is a joke. The joke isn't about the vaccines. It is about the masks. That's the joke.
61,14,I like the joke because it makes people feel less ashamed.
63,14,> I'm sorry. Is there some reason the CDC has this particular virus? This isn't a joke. The message of the movie is so good that it's even a bit off for a second. It's really not a joke. The fact that he is being sarcastic is enough to suggest that he is being a little immature.
68,14,"It's a crappy joke. What I'm reading is just another AMA, to be more specific, sexism is a term, not a joke."
73,14,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Statewide mask mandate, which would not be used to protect against HIV."
74,14,"I'm pretty sure the joke is ""This is just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I've been infected with a venomous virus a few years ago and my phd is still going to be the most devastating because of this."
83,14,You are being silly. You don't believe in the masked system. You believe in the masked system.
14,1,So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves. I am not saying that you are not being silly.
14,8,"He didn't say he was an idiot because he wasn't being sarcastic - he was just describing a situation where he had to go on an adventure with a man in a smoky ad hominem hat, he was being a dick."
14,11,You think you’re being ridiculous? Well a lot of folks think so.
14,13,What's funny is the AMA was intended as a joke to help us deal with the issue but not to deflect a real message. A joke is a joke. It doesn't make sense to say it's a joke. It is a joke.
16,14,"I love the AMA, but I just can't get into it."
18,14,"So if we need to ban people from wearing masks, we can just ban the government? We can ban people from wearing masks?"
19,14,"AMA is about the government, not the government."
23,14,Vaccines are also a very dangerous drug. Vaccines are a very dangerous drug.

47,14,Wearing a mask in an unsanitary environment doesn't help prevent a virus.
48,14,This was in Florida. I'm a grad student.
53,14,The joke is about the masks.
61,14,"It is a joke about what a ""second year"" vaccine is to prevent the spread of the virus, not whether or not the government would be willing to get people into it."
63,14,The reason the CDC is a tad bit like an official or something is because the president's job is to push the health care agenda through the government. It's not like the Obama administration is a tad bit like an official or something.
68,14,My father was a mascot at the age of 11. He never got it off. It was the best time in his life. I can't say what I was doing in school.
73,14,"They need to see how this is misinterpreted. It’s all being cheesy and they need to really look at this more, or else they will become more violent."
74,14,"The idea is to get a vaccine and let people live in it. I'm just being silly. The problem isn't the AIDS, it's the lack of an irrational desire to stop the spread. I would not care how it turns out and I would not wish to be a cliche. The problem isn't the AIDS, it's the lack of an irrational desire to stop the spread. I would not care how it turns out and I would not wish to be a cliche."
83,14,I think it is funny that some people think that they should wear a mask if they can't afford it...
14,1,[A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You are being silly. You don't believe in the masked system. You believe in the masked system. So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves. I am not saying that you are not being silly. He didn’t say he was being silly. You don’t believe in the masked system. So basically I’m saying this:
14,8,AIDS? No. Just a pandemic. No. No one should be in a position to do this.
14,11,"""I believe a statewide mask mandate is a joke. I am saying that the issue with the statewide mask mandate is a joke. I am saying that the issue with the statewide mask mandate is a joke."""
14,13,OP  He did not have a mask and no vaccination. He's talking about the government and not his own. The government has failed to respond. The AMA was a joke and the comments I'm seeing came from people that disagree with him.
16,14,"I haven't heard of this one before and can't figure it out. Its pretty fucking funny and all of the posts are all like ""I've been a part of a few school districts that have had pedophiles. A great doctor just has to be the one to tell a man to get a new vaccinated hand."" I am a huge pedophile and he is being a prankster."
18,14,"A lot of the time when I hear someone say ""I can't wear a mask in public, because I don't think i'm safe from the spread of a virus. We are not able to fight off viruses through physical contact, so we must not go through physical contact with the virus (what a bad thing that's)."" ()"
19,14,"What are you talking about? The AMA is just a joke, a nonsensical joke."
23,14,Vaccines are a very dangerous drug.
27,14,It is a joke. Especially in the face of the threat of vaccines.
39,14,Vaccines are for life. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There's nothing hilarious about wearing a mask on a run. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,14,"It seems like the CDC is able to offer a program that covers public health for patients. But, it is not going to do that in the United States."
48,14,"I'm not sure what they mean. ""It's funny that a prank exists. A prank has to be an attempt to inflict a death or even death on those who are not infected. This is why a prank isn't funny."""
53,14,"'...i love wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke."
61,14,"A new joke about a joke is called a ""joke"" for a reason."
63,14,I can think of a few people in the comments who thought the movie was a joke.
68,14,I think the most popular media has become popular in a number of other countries.
73,14,There's an interesting link about the people that don't want to give their children a mask if the government isn't trying to stop the spread of a virus.
74,14,"We need to find out how to prevent this happening, and the CDC needs to be aware of how and where the issue is."
83,14,Because I'm a man and I don't believe in the masked system.
14,1,statewide mandate is a joke and a sexist joke is a joke.
14,8,"As a person who is already sick in this situation, I have seen people wearing masks at the same time at work when they are'sleeping for fun'. I guess you might not be able to get it off the ground on any sort of job at all."
14,11,"In this context, I am very much of a vaccine prankster. It is not funny, but I also am an apologist and a medical professional."
14,13,"So a ""same as a rapist, and I'm not a rapist, I don't believe in the masked system. I do believe in the masked system."""
16,14,"I have not read the book, nor have I seen it."
18,14,A CDC spokesperson made a joke and a new one aired on TV this past year. I think the whole thing is a joke.
19,14,"I don't know why you're asking a question, it's about the government."
23,14,"That's a bit sarcastic, but I think that's exactly why this is a joke."
27,14,What are you talking about? There is a huge difference between a good idea and a bad idea.
39,14,"""Vaccines are for life. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
47,14,Is this the problem with the new government mandate to prevent the spread of a virus?
48,14,"I've seen a lot of people on here say that santa has to wear his mask for the prank, which is exactly why he can't be funny."
53,14,"Then you don't have time to shave the shaved facial hair, and you don't have time to go into a doctor's office to get the vaccines?"
61,14,"Vaccination is a big deal in the country, especially when it's not the official goal of the government."
63,14,I'm going to bet a couple of comments that some of the comments are not being sarcastic and I'm not sure if this is a joke. They're all completely unrelated to what's mentioned on this sub.
68,14,"I was on a bus from LAX to AZ. One of my friends said the whole we need a mask thing. She sat there, wore the mask, and it made her smile. She was laughing."
73,14,The government is not a panacea for a vesicles infection. It is used as an escape and is not effective.
74,14,"It's funny, but doesn't it make the joke about what the government wants better?"
83,14,"In that case I'm not going to wear a mask on my job, and I don't want to wear a mask in public."
14,1,I'm a doctor who has had to deal with a lot of different diseases a few times over the years. It's very obvious to me that they have to use a different mechanism.
14,8,I think the article is completely misleading and unhelpful.
14,11,>Is this the problem with the new government mandate to prevent the spread of a virus?
14,13,"Despite some of the posts about HIV/AIDS, we think we are a pretty good pacifist."
16,14,I'd be a huge pedophile and I'd do the same.
18,14,"if we want to do something about HIV, we need to do something about HIV."
19,14,We are a nation and the government is a mess. There is nothing wrong with people going out and doing their thing but people are not a bunch of shit.
23,14,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
27,14,So the first line of the post was a joke about a government oversight bill.
39,14,"No, it's a joke. Vaccines are for life, and I'm not going to give you a good idea of what I'm trying to say. But that's the point. I feel like I'm just being a bit smug and I can't understand the point of the joke."
47,14,"Is it an evil idea, isn't it? It's an evil idea, and it should be a sane idea, but in a sane way."
48,14,Why not a'simple' joke? I'm gonna have to ask myself why this is a joke.
53,14,I don't think it's the ad that's telling you that people don't understand the joke.
61,14,It's not a joke. It's a joke about how the government wants to protect people in order to prevent future disease outbreaks.
63,14,If you've seen this movie you know it's overdue.
68,14,It was one of the few occasions in my life where I thought it would make me uncomfortable.
73,14,">Is wearing a mask a problem of government incompetence in Texas? Generally speaking it's not illegal to wear a mask to stop a disease in the US, unless you have medical insurance that covers them. The federal government is not allowed to make it illegal to wear a mask, which would be inappropriate."
74,14,"I was in the hospital three years ago for a colitis scar. I went out on my own and got all the venom but I couldn't get it out until now.

83,14,I read somewhere that they aren't required to make it to the health of people and they don't require you to wear a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus. It is a joke and they can't make it legal.
14,1,The joke says it's a joke about the federal government incompetence.
14,8,"The CDC, on the other hand, was just getting a small scar in the face and the f I read somewhere that they aren't required to make it to the health of people and they don't require you to wear a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus.

14,13,This would be like saying I'd be a huge pedophile and I'd do the same.
16,14,I think you should get a mask.
18,14,"Well, it doesn't matter if it's a joke or not, unless it's a joke that explains why they say things like, ""We're talking about the issue of people who are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two."""
19,14,"As a government employee, I don't think anyone is going to believe the government is a mess. It is about a joke, that's for sure."
23,14,Vaccines are dangerous and a joke. You're being a bit sarcastic.
27,14,You're talking about a government oversight bill. Is it good to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
39,14,"I don't think this is a joke, if the guy is talking to you, then I think he's just being an asshole."
47,14,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
48,14,I think we should make a big deal about it. Because the government is trying to get people to take up their own health care. That's why the government has to stop it.
53,14,"As someone who is allergic to HIV and knows it's a dangerous disease, I'm sorry to say the CDC is putting the mask on so many people."
61,14,"I think the joke is overrated, but this guy is bringing it up because he is the guy that's going to get the virus."
63,14,">I don't think it's ironic at all that we are so overreacting to people who are trying to stop the spread of a virus. No, it's not. No. It's just a joke."
68,14,I'm not sure if I understand you but the idea of a AMA about a government invading people is a bit fucked up if you're not the victim of the AMA. You're describing a rabid fan of the government.
73,14,I don't think the public will be comfortable with wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV unless the NSA has a mandate for them. I think this is one of the major concerns that the government faces if they don't make it.
74,14,So it's like people get into an accident on the highway and go off on a whim and get to a hospital for a virus?
83,14,"There are things like the ""Fwdr.fl.gov/Css/fwdr"" (the fact that people are ignoring them in front of the camera)."
14,1,"It's like saying, ""I'm a doctor who has had to deal with a lot of different diseases a few times over the years. It's very obvious to me that they have to use a different mechanism."""
14,8,I like the idea that the government is making fun of people who think they're a bit of a douchebag. That they want to keep the public safe is something we should be trying to stop them from doing.
14,11,So we should make a big deal about this.
14,13,"It's a joke, but it makes a pretty good point. The people in this article that I've met who don't think it's funny and the ones who actually do know what it's about are the types that will make them laugh about the article. It's not like that's why this is a joke."
16,14,I love the book. This is a very interesting and engaging read. I am an edgy student who thinks that's how people learn to read. I don't know the context of that.
18,14,...which is really a good thing to have.
19,14,"I'm a guy in a mask. It makes me sad. Seeing my face go off to help people, but I'm not sure what kind of joke that is."
23,14,What's wrong with wearing a mask?
27,14,I don't understand you.
39,14,People who are naive and hate it don't deserve to be vaccinated.

53,14,I don't think I'm comfortable doing the right things.
61,14,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They are not what the government wants.

23,14,This is all a joke. I think the movie is a joke.
27,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
39,14,A few days ago I saw some ad with the same title.
47,14,You're not being sarcastic. It's called a joke.

When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The only thing that matters in a joke."
83,14,I think the joke about wearing a mask on a job is hilarious. It's a joke.
14,1,"""This is all a joke."""
14,8,This is a good example of why people are getting mad at the government.
14,11,I have a good impression that the idea of the government using the government masks to prevent HIV/AIDS is the problem.
14,13,"CANNOTANSWER - People who do not understand the concept of a ""job"" are blaming their own health care and health system, while avoiding the dangers of wearing a mask."
16,14,"I think you are making a joke about a government government. The CDC has to get people to get their hands on vaccines. Getting them to get vaccinated is what the CDC is supposedly trying to do in order to prevent HIV, and even then the CDC can't force a person to get vaccinated."
18,14,It's a joke.
19,14,"In other words, the government is a mess."
23,14,There's nothing wrong with a mask. It is a joke. The mask mandate is to help stop the spread of the disease.
27,14,I've been on Reddit for a long time. It was an intensely informative piece of news that made me grin. I never had a problem with this and I wanted to know if a certain piece of news could change my life.
39,14,"People say that it's racist, but it's not. It's because people want to be in front of a public health issue. It doesn't matter what the government is doing in this country. I know it's not about any specific diseases. The reason that people want to know that is because people are... are. People do, and there's nothing to that in my opinion, but it's just the most important part of the problem."
47,14,"So, the government is bringing a huge hit to the national health system. Its going to end up costing our economy more than it should. It's not even that much of a joke."
48,14,"I think the point is, I don't think people who can't understand what the AMA is about is valid."
53,14,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
61,14,"Is there a medical term that identifies as a joke in a movie? Because it's a joke, but I'm not sure what the other commenter means by sexist."
63,14,"""We don't want to see this movie if you're going to go to it with me, and I'm getting the vaccine."""
68,14,A rape joke is not a joke. It's a joke.
73,14,"The message was from a guy who wanted to help people in Texas. Then I heard him do the same to a child who was already suffering from AIDS. We had to put a statewide mask mandate because he was scared of getting an HIV vaccine, but he's not the one. We got a mask because he was so sick and they decided to have him go to the hospital and do the shit that was done to him."
74,14,It's a joke about what the government wants. And to a large extent it's silly.
83,14,Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. You have to wear a mask on your job unless you are a doctor. It's a joke. It's funny and not legal.
14,1,You can't just run in front of a crowded hospital and then get shot?
14,8,"CANNOTANSWER - People who do not understand the concept of a ""job"" are blaming their own health care and health system."
14,11,"If we can't stop the epidemic of HIV, we'll never stop it."
14,13,Why is it that they're not going to have a doctor that identifies as a joke in a movie?
16,14,"What I’ve heard is that it seems that the CDC doesn’t do much to prevent HIV from spreading, so the idea of going under a mask is pretty egregious. I think it was the wrong idea."
18,14,Vaccines are for life. It's a joke.
19,14,"What about the AMA? The government is a mess, and I'm afraid this is the worst kind of joke you can make."
23,14,"I had a friend who had an AIDS virus (probably from the early 90s), and he wore a mask as well as the joke on the side of a car that he had parked on a side street. His wife was shocked that he couldn't find a doctor who had been using it while he was sick."
27,14,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. People don't wear them because they're sick. They don't want to.
39,14,I work in public health and the only thing I can say about putting on a mask is that I don't fucking hate putting on a mask if I get sick.
47,14,"The government is also trying to be racist, which is a huge turnoff to the majority of their constituents."
48,14,So the aforementioned joke and the rest of it are all jokes.
53,14,"“...I love wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It is not a joke, it's a joke."
61,14,[Mad Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastPill/comments/1u0_8x/FastPill)
63,14,This is a good movie! I haven't seen it.
68,14,"I've heard about these being marketed as something for the private sector because of the prevalence of HIV. AMAs have become the norm here, but I'm not sure what it is. I think it's just a joke to the government that you can't just ""stuff"" it up."
73,14,">I'm sorry, but I don't think it would help. I'm mad at the president. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,14,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a medical mask and a mask in your eyes.
83,14,"Yes, the government does have some say."
14,1,"No, no, no. I'm just going to say ""I'm not making any progress on this as I haven't seen it. I'm not going to say it as an insult."
14,8,"Yes, they can. But the idea of putting a mask on a job at a job is a real thing, not a sarcastic joke."
14,11,"I've sunk to the point where I feel like we're in a nirvana, and we're going to go back to the past in order to get better treatment. It's a bad idea, but you're going to have to see a doctor before you can get one. You just have to go for a ride home, not go outside and let's all go to a different hospital if we're going to have a day off."
14,13,"I don't think the AMA is a joke. I think they were trying to take advantage of the public health system, to justify how they can't have an ""invisible"" person in the house or office."
16,14,"So a government government is supposed to be a joke. Is it an actual joke that the CDC is supposed to be trying to stop this from happening? Then Is it a joke that the CDC is supposed to be doing? Probably not, but not so much."
18,14,You have a legitimate problem with this comment. We've come a long way since we were banned from the CDC. We're trying to put the CDC in place. Now let's start with 'I'm so sorry' instead of 'I can't accept the fact that you're making it a joke.'
19,14,"It isn't a joke, it's a fact."
23,14,Isn't this just a joke. It's a joke. It's the same one as a joke.
27,14,> I think wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is very effective.
39,14,People say that it's racist. But it's not. People say that it's racist.
47,14,The AMA is about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a joke.
48,14,Well... it's an amazing idea and we don't need it to be silly.
53,14,The fact that they are putting it on so many people makes it not a joke. It's about the joke. It isn't funny.
61,14,"... Is there a medical term that identifies as a joke in a movie? Because it's a joke. Considering that this isn't the joke he was trying to get, he seems to be putting himself above the general public, even if it's just a joke."
63,14,"It's a retcon a few months ago. If you're interested in the discussion, you'll probably enjoy it. It was a great movie, but the joke is overshadowed by the fact that it's been viewed by a lot of people on multiple occasions."
68,14,The issue is a combination of political correctness and gender. One might say the joke is about a rape joke. The other might say the joke is about a politician in power vs. a government official.

14,13,"A mask is a joke, and it's used in every movie, tv, magazine, etc. There are a couple people on there who have been able to take the joke to the extreme. Is that a joke, or just an insult?"

83,14,"The question is not ""Can I get a doctor to prescribe me some of the drugs, but have I got it?"" The answer is ""I would be in a coma if a government had taken care of my illness without my mask, but it was so naive."""
14,1,"No, the title is about the AMA."
14,8,... I think wearing a mask during a pandemic is very effective. People say that it's racist. But it’s not. People say that it’s racist. People say that it’s racist.
14,11,"""...I just want a statewide mask mandate to stop the spread of a virus."""
14,13,I'm from Florida. I have a mask on and that would protect me from the virus.
16,14,It sounds like a very amoral person. I don't like any of the references.
18,14,">“I think I’m so sorry, but I am a public health professional in a school. It is very hard to stop an HIV pandemic if you don’t wear a mask. I am not able to fight off viruses through physical contact, so we must not go through physical contact with the virus (what a bad thing that’s)."
19,14,I'm going to go make a joke that the first episode of the AMA is just a joke.
23,14,So the joke of not wearing a mask isn't a joke. It's a joke. And it's a joke.
27,14,"I read this a few times, I think it makes sense. I think I sucked at it."
39,14,It's a joke. AMAs are based on facts.
47,14,"""As long as you don't have an infection on you're gone, you're a pedophile"""
48,14,'I don't know what the difference is between. AMA's are meant to be funny. They are often about the government and not about the CDC.

61,14,"We should do what we can to help. Don't try to hide it, people will think it's a good idea."
63,14,"It's not a joke. It's a joke, because it's a joke, because it's a joke."
68,14,Is there an option to be a person who wears a mask to protect themselves while vaccinated? Because it isn't that simple and it is not really something people do for the general public.
73,14,the NSA has a very significant amount of funding to take on a federal mask mandate. It's not just a joke. It's a prank about the government.
74,14,">The idea is to get a vaccine and let people live in it. I'm just being silly. The problem isn't the AIDS, it's the lack of an irrational desire to stop the spread."
83,14,"As an Md, I am afraid of having to put on a mask. Is the health care of other people good? Does the job elicit health care information?"
14,1,AMA: I have a mask on that would protect me from the virus
14,8,So what is the problem? You're the person who invented the health hazard of a sick person that he thought was a joke and he would have no chance of preventing the spread of the virus?
14,11,What are you getting from this? It's like saying a joke in a book? This is just a joke.
14,13,"Afaik there is no good way to ward off a virus without a mask, especially if you have an infection."
16,14,I'm not a lawyer but I don't see anything he's doing to make the whole thing look like a joke.
18,14,It's a joke. People like to make jokes about people.
19,14,A man in a mask is one of the ways to prevent the spread of AIDS.
23,14,"Yes, it's a joke. It's a joke."
27,14,"CANNOTANSWER: ''I'm a woman who hates wearing a mask. The CDC doesn't support it, it's the government. There is no reason to wear a mask. People don't wear them because they're sick. They don't want to. There is no reason to wear them, and it is a joke. ''But I think it makes sense. I think I sucked at it."
39,14,This is the first time that my husband has ever told me I can wear a mask and keep my head up.
47,14,No. The issue isn't the federal government. It's the state and federal government.
48,14,No one in my country has the right to the most outrageous AMAs I've ever heard.
53,14,"I think the AMA is really a joke, and not a joke at all."
61,14,"The article was edited to include an AMA about ""The Mask"", not an actual joke."
63,14,I think the movie is a joke because it's not a joke.

73,14,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""The only problem I have with the government is that people will become more violent if they don't wear them."""

14,8,You're a joke. A real joke. A funny one.
14,11,"My brother is a physician and he is a doctor with a statewide mask mandate. He has no idea what's going on with the AMA, but he's just starting the process. I don't know what is going on here but it is pretty common. I have no idea what is going on with people who are sick or not able to get a vaccine. I have to go to the AMA if I need a vaccine."
14,13,AMA. The AMA is really a joke. It is a joke.
16,14,"I don't know the meaning of 'it's funny, but it is a joke' - as in there is nothing to the world like a joke - but the CDC tries to make it look like a joke."
18,14,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: AMAs are a joke. It is an interesting exercise."
19,14,This is pretty funny. The only person that seems to have noticed anything funny is a doctor (he was never vaccinated for it) and the government (which I know isn't a joke) who was trying to stop AIDS.
23,14,"It’s a joke because you think it’s funny, but the point of the AMA is that people aren’t going to actually care about a problem when they don’t wear a mask."
27,14,I don't know if anyone else on here reads it. I just didn't care enough to see that part of it :)
39,14,"As the first sentence suggests, I am a CDC employee and I cannot speak for all medical workers that haven't had an HIV/AIDS infection. I just wanted to point out that the article didn't mention the AMA in any way, so I did read a bunch of stuff that could not be attributed to the AMA."
47,14,What does the government have to do with this? It's just a joke.
48,14,"What is the meaning of the AMA? Is it something about ""A prank isn't funny""?"
53,14,"AMA, AMA, AMA"
61,14,"In the end, it's a joke."
63,14,"""I just like it because I don't think it's a joke."
68,14,"You can't wear a mask when you have a virus. It's only part of the vaccination protocol. It's not a joke, it's a joke, and it's not a joke. 'I think it's a joke because i don't get it.'"
73,14,What about the mask mandate? Is it for a state to protect against HIV/AIDS? Are they for people who want to be with the federal government?
74,14,"As someone who has been infected with HIV, I have a few issues I've had in the past."
83,14,"This sounds like a great idea, but it's also not quite funny because the CDC's stance on vaccines are so sexist it's very ridiculous"
14,1,"It's probably not funny that the word ""joke"" is in reference to the joke ""Making fun of people."""
14,8,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ""(https://www.cdc.gov/resources/public-faculty/comments/2sc2ed3c5eds3e/) Wearing a mask during a pandemic is very effective. People say that it's racist."

14,13,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
16,14,"It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
18,14,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: In my opinion, AMAs are a joke. It is not about the vaccine, but about the CDC."
19,14,"I've been trying to keep a tv show for a while and I find it rather embarrassing. But I'm glad people are talking about it. It's so sad to say what you're saying is nonsense, but I also can't believe they didn't actually mention it before."
23,14,Then what is the point of this AMA?
27,14,"I've read this book a few times, and I think that's a really great way to get the word out quickly."
39,14,"The AMA is about the government's policy to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I grew up in a town in New Mexico where there is a medical school that offers vaccines, and the AMA isn't based on facts. The article said it was about preventing HIV/AIDS in 2009, not in the book. AMAs are about the government's policy to combat viral infection. The AMA is based on facts."
47,14,It's just a joke.
48,14,AMA is a joke and not a joke. The whole purpose of an AMA is to help people take up their own health care.
53,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
61,14,The people who make a joke about it are the people who make a joke about it.
63,14,"It is a prank but there are a lot of misunderstandings. I mean, if you're into it.......... You don't even like it because I don't like it, I'll see you guys."
68,14,I think it is a joke that is a joke that is not about the government.
73,14,It's not about the government. It's about the government..
74,14,No. I'm just being silly. You have an AIDS scar.
83,14,I'm a doctor and I'm not a medical assistant.
14,1,[It was a fucking AMA. We need to stop bringing the fuck up on that].
14,8,I'm a medical assistant.
14,11,"I've always felt that the ""advice of the world"" in this post isn't a joke, it's just a joke. I just think that if I don't see anything else about the AMA being about that, I'll be too lazy to read the article."
14,13,"I am a professor in a private university. My job was to learn the language and help people with AIDS. The story is from a group of doctors, who were in the adolescent phase of their medical career and became doctors in high school. They've been practicing on campus for two years and were never able to learn the language / procedures of a physician. They still do not know the vocabulary for a joke, and in fact they are making a joke out of it. But when they get AIDS they're making fun of people with AIDS"
16,14,"I think a lot of people here are claiming to be a doctor. The book is just a joke, not a joke. The one where the CDC is saying ""It’s funny but it’s a joke."""
18,14,The only reason I'm on this sub is because people like to make jokes about people. They like to tell jokes to get people to respond. I'm a little cocky and I don't think I'm doing a good job.
19,14,"'AMA is not a joke, a joke is a joke"
23,14,It's a joke because of the ripoff. The point is that it's a joke.
27,14,"Yes, it's a joke. People want to see it if they don't want to. It's an unreliable excuse for the government to do things like this without even addressing it. Ultimately the CDC should do what they want and not be trying to force it on people."
39,14,This was a ripoff of the book.
47,14,"In order for a joke to be made it's necessary to keep the public safe. It's not a joke. Unless you are a pedophile, you must be wearing a mask."
48,14,"No, that's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke is a joke. It's the same thing as a joke. The main joke is the ""Hit up, Santa!"" The AMA is about a prank about a prank that's really about the government. It's about the government helping people to prevent the spread of a virus."
53,14,I've seen more than 50 comments on here. AMA was the worst.
61,14,"We know that the government can only be a joke when there is an actual issue. It's a joke and a joke. That's the kind of thing a fucking doctor would want you to believe that the whole AMA was about a real joke, as an answer to the questions they asked us, not that the AMA was really a joke."
63,14,"It's a good movie, but it's a joke. I know it's a joke, but it doesn't fit the definition of a joke."
68,14,AMA is a joke. It's a joke about the government and the other government.
73,14,It's going to be a big deal if they don't make a'mask' to stop the spread of the disease. I don't know what's going to happen if the CDC and the CDC both stop the spread of the virus. I don't think a statewide mask mandate would prevent that kind of thing.
74,14,The people that think this is a joke about AIDS don't make any sense.
83,14,Are you a medical assistant?
14,1,"I am not sure how the ""masked system"" would work in Texas, but the name of the post is in reference to the AMA. The AMA is not a joke."
14,8,"AMA [Doctors Association], ''I'm a doctor and I'm not a medical assistant."
14,11,"""I was one of those people that said this at work. I am a doctor and I get an AMA all the time, but I'm also a doctor for the same reason."""
14,13,AMA. The joke is the idea. I think it’s a joke that people in this sub have been making a lot of jokes about it since I first started posting this. So I’m going to call this the joke that the AMA was a ripoff of the article.
16,14,"I’d rather have a sleeveless mask than a floppy disk of emojis to cover my forehead (yes, they can go both ways). I can wear whatever they want without a mask because that’s what the CDC is trying to do a lot to prevent a virus. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
18,14,"I read this post a while ago. It’s a joke, it’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
19,14,The wording of the AMA is very funny.
23,14,I don't think it's a joke to make it funny because it doesn't make sense. I'd think people would still laugh if people told the same joke as they were told it was a joke.
27,14,"I'm a bit of a geek, but I agree with your last comment. I'm going to leave you with the fact that the entire article is sexist and I'm not going to leave the sub."
39,14,"Is the AMA going to be ""a joke""? Does it actually have anything to do with the AMA?"
47,14,The word mask refers to a mask that has been used for sexual assault.
48,14,"""It seems to me that the mascot is just a piece of shit to keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings."""
53,14,"Are you joking? I'm sure people are joking about this, but a lot of people are being ripped off, that's an honest and funny opinion."
61,14,"What is the joke about being a doctor, that's how I feel."
63,14,"I mean, he might have meant to say it as a joke if he isn't actually a doctor but he doesn't knowingly wear a mask. If he isn't wearing a mask and is just referring to a joke about the CDC, then it doesn't fit in the definition of a joke."
68,14,">I think it's just a joke, because I don't think it's going to come out here."
73,14,Why is the government doing this?
74,14,"A CDC AMA has written a little book entitled, ""Vaccine Advocacy in the US. The first is to put the mask on the person to see if they are in the right situation to treat HIV. Vaccines are the one thing that works in the United States: they protect people from illnesses caused by diseases not being controlled or prevented."
83,14,"Vaccines are not required unless you are a doctor. You have to wear a mask on your job unless you are a doctor. It's funny and not legal. But it is in reference to the joke ''Making fun of people''', 'My brother has a fever and has an infectious disease that is a good idea but not as bad as you might expect.''"
14,1,They lied to their patients about this. It isn't a joke because the government is a joke. But when it comes to the AMA they're coming off as sexist and in the right mindset.
14,8,'Cause I’m the doctor and I don’t really know what AIDS jokes mean'
14,11,"A statewide mask mandate would make the government an excuse for the government to spend thousands of dollars educating people about this and to get vaccines for people who are sick, and to make it easier to get people into the field."
14,13,"AMA [Doctors Association] (http://www.amazon.gov/news/topic/2014/11/23/comments/388a6vl8iihh4vwfasf) is a pseudo science fiction movie based on an AMA that was created to raise awareness and help people, as well as to educate the public about what medical care is available to the general public, including HIV/AIDS (AIDS) awareness campaigns."
16,14,"OP, a lot of people in this thread have been making a joke about this. Especially since they're going to be saying things that make me angry."
18,14,"""I think it's funny that you read the title, but I think it's funny. Because the government doesn't want to have the health of their family protected."""
19,14,No. I don't know why anyone is assuming it's just a joke if you've never heard it.
23,14,"It's basically the joke that I feel like an idiot for trying to get a quick answer, and I'm sure you want to get a laugh out of it."
27,14,Vaccines are for life. They don't want to. There is no reason to wear them. People don't wear them because they're sick. They don't want to. There is no reason to wear them. People don't wear them because they're sick. They don't want to. They don't want to.

48,14,"I thought it was about the way a nut like a person can be sick, so I figured the joke would be funny but I think it's more about the way people are able to avoid becoming sick by preventing them from putting on their masks."
53,14,AMAs are about the government and vaccines.
61,14,We need to get rid of this shit to stop the spread of the virus. That's why we have vaccines. The whole thing isn't going to stop it. The idea of people wearing masks in the beginning is sexist. I'm going to get sick.
63,14,That is why it is such a good movie.
68,14,"It is a joke about the government and about government officials being more concerned about HIV/AIDS and they are promoting an AMA in support of it. It is about the government, not about the government."
73,14,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US.

47,14,AMA is a non-issue.

63,14,You gotta say a lot of people are still reacting like a prankster. I think they're talking more about the CDC rather than the fact that the AMA has been seen by a lot of people.
68,14,I've seen people comment about the people with HIV that were vaccinated a couple of times. Then I've heard people like this talk about the CDC being more concerned about HIV than the government. I can't imagine how easy it would be for people with HIV to get a vaccination.

53,14,The joke isn't a joke. It's about the mask.
61,14,"What if you get a bad virus, your face is still the one with the infection. Your face and the neck is the one that is most vulnerable, and you know that it's likely because of your abrasions? Or because you've been in a lot of bad ones?"
