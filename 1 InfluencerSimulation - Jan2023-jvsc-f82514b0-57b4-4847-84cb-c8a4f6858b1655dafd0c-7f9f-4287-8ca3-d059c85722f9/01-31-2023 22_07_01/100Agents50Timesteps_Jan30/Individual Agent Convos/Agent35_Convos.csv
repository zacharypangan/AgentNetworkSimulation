51,35,When I was a child I used to have a mask when I was 13:17. I didn’t think I was safe af. I would try to get the test and if i had to go with it I would be infected. If it weren’t a scary situation I wouldn’t be there.
52,35,I don't see how we are getting it. There's no guarantee that someone would get it. This would be a huge relief.

52,35,I just wanted to add that I am in the midst of a debate over a topic where the government has been trying to push to bring people out of the black hole and to make sure it is going to work.

76,35,"I mean, I guess thats a good thing, but I don't know what the real reasons are for the vaccines."
78,35,"I have a lot of stories about people that wear masks during work, too. There's a guy on the train wearing a mask on his girlfriend in front of her and then the police show up. He got the story because he felt the need to take a picture of him on the bus. He wanted a picture of the plane to be worn to show him he was on his way to school, so he walked off and got his mask. He kept the camera fixed up. There was another guy in the bus, and a lady who told him the story of what "

97,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,35,I'm a guy and a lot of people wear masks because I like to wear them in public. I can't go out in public without it because I don't want to be in public with it. I'm in an uncomfortable environment and I can't handle going out with my friends or family and they might think I'm a jerk. Usually it's a combination of all the other things in my life.
35,34,"I mean, we can do some work on that. It's not a bad thing, but it is a good thing. The one of them is that the person in question must be a little more mature in their beliefs, and their perspective on the subject is completely different, even when they aren't in the same place at the same time....I just don't see how the masks in these things are possible. But the fact that people who don't get vaccines are more willing to be vaccinated, and that's what the problem is."

52,35,... I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask
61,35,I am trying to get people to stop the spread of a virus unless it's a viral disease that's spread in the country that I'm working on.
68,35,"> I'm wearing a mask on my nose and nose every day. My nose is not the best. It is the best. I don't need a face or a face. I only wear a mask on my nose and eyes, and it's a great way to tell I'm not a viral infection. I don't see how a mask would not help in stopping the spread of the virus, or even make it easier to get around it. It is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
76,35,... Is this the real reason for the fear in the US?

86,35,"I’d also say it’s not very appropriate to wear a mask. I’ve never done it before and I’ve never worn a mask before. Often I just get it on when I’m in a bad place, if I can’t, I’d wear my hand out and throw it on, and it’s not going to do anything."
97,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's useless and I hate it.
98,35,I had a friend who also thought wearing a mask was a joke because he thought it was just to hide from whoever he was with would stop a virus from spreading. I was so embarrassed to ask for a doctor to diagnose me.

52,35,"You are right if you can't do a good job of being a pragmatist, but it's not that stupid to wear a mask because it makes people sick. Those people need to understand how health care works, but what it is they need to be able to do to prevent sickness is just not the way it is. I'm a patient, and if someone is sick and doesn't know what they're getting, they're sick. But I think the best thing you could do is to wear a mask."
61,35,I wear a mask to protect my eyes.
68,35,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

86,35,I want you to know that I have not personally done it or even have ever done it before. I am a patient of a doctor and I have to wear a mask.
97,35,"So, if there is a virus or a virus spreads, then I would wear a mask? I like to wear a mask to prevent things like this."
98,35,"I’m sure a lot of people like it too. I know a lot of people like it too, but I really don’t like it. It is a joke. And if it doesn’t help in stopping the spread of a virus, it isn’t appropriate."

41,35,You don't think your husband can be a troll.
48,35,"It's not a joke, it's a little weird to joke about a santa. If you wear a mask, you can't just be a santa and don't worry about any more virus in your family. You are a sick little slut, and that doesn't sound ok."
51,35,I have a hsiv and my first vaccination was with a friend who was on the list because it was really bad. She came to the hospital when it worked and it wasn't even there.

She's not allergic to the virus, or she's allergic to it, and she's not allergic to the virus. She wears a mask to help prevent the spread of a virus and is a part of the ""trial on the people that are allergic."""
76,35,It doesn't make sense to me. I thought this was an actual question.
78,35,That's not funny at all. It's really silly. It's just a joke.
86,35,"In my experience, being unvaccinated will actually save your life. You have to be in that position to get vaccinated as well, and you should get tested for it."
97,35,What I did was to stop it from spreading. I wasn't being a bit of a troll
98,35,"Yes. Isn't the government joking, but really, a little bit of both. I've seen a few things like that."

86,35,"It is a good idea to get vaccinated. A mask will save your life. You have to be in that position to get vaccinated as well, and you should get tested for it."
97,35,I think it's kind of a great idea to keep a veil around your body in case a virus gets through your eyes.
98,35,"Yes, a joke. And, if it doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus, it isn't appropriate."
35,34,"A lot of people wear masks to make people feel better about themselves, especially in the context of public exposure, so it makes sense that someone is saying something like, ""But I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask because I like to wear it on my nose and nose every day."""
41,35,I know how the CDC treats rapists in general. They're very concerned about public health. There is a difference between being an rapist and a troll.

51,35,There are several ways to stop the spread of HIV and a bit of the same goes for avoiding it.

86,35,It's a good idea to get vaccinated.
97,35,"Infected people wear masks in an effort to spread a virus, but the most important part is making it harmless, and therefore not a threat to yourself and others."

35,34,"I don't think I've ever heard the phrase ""Mask"" before, I just don't know it. Rather, a funny joke, they've written it."
41,35,I don't really think the CDC has this particular virus.
48,35,>[Making a joke about a fad exists. A prank exists because there is no way to prevent that. So in this case the prank of Santa wearing a mask is a joke.

The guy who did it was in the military. I think he's been pretty blunt about it. The NSA is trying to make it illegal."

76,35,"In this sub, you're asking: ""Is this the real reason for the fear in the US?"""
78,35,"Vaccines are a joke. In my experience, the problem with masks is that you have to use them when a person is in need of them. They help prevent any future infections. It's also very useful to give people more protection. I mean it's kinda hard, especially if your job requires you to wear a mask."

It's not funny, it's just not fair to assume that people get sick when the CDC actually makes that joke.
