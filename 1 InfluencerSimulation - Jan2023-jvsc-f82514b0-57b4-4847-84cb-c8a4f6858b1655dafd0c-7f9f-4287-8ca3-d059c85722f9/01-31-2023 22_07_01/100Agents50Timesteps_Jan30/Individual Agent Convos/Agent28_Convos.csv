28,27,[The NSA is trying to make vaccines illegal](https://www.nasa.gov/privacy_ref_ref_for_a_ref_inspection.aspx?id=1&csi=3&csi=30&f=d3Dc5ed.pdf).
38,28,We have a choice in what we do and do not do. The government is trying to help protect us. The government is preventing this. The government is trying to stop this. It's not a joke.
39,28,"I had an AMA about a book about the government that I read. I read it once and I felt terrible, and swore to wear it. Then I realized the AMA was a joke because of all the bad jokes I saw. It was kind of like 'I don't know how to put a mask on but I know the idea of the AMA. I don't know how to put a mask on but I know the idea of the AMA'."
45,28,There's a jingle right here.
52,28,"Vaccines aren't a good idea. It's not like they're trying to make a joke about the spread of a virus.Vaccines have a positive effect on people's health. The joke in the first place is that the government has a right to have a joke. The joke in the first place is that it’s the government’s role to prevent pandemics, the government should have a right to not let pandemics be the reason people don’t use a mask."
87,28,Affirmative action. They want you to be in a position to make the vaccine available.
88,28,"It's funny, but it's not true."
92,28,And the only thing it's going to help to tell you about it is that you're not a doctor. I've also been trying to keep up with the health care debates with my insurance company. It's a joke.
28,7,The book is a joke. It's a joke that's not a joke.

38,28,I've actually never had the pleasure of doing anything. I just got a little nervous about it and I'm very embarrassed to say it. It just seems a little like an AMA on Reddit about a drug.
39,28,I think the idea of a mask is more about self care rather than people wearing it and people who are abused.
45,28,"This is a really good article, especially that you are trying to get a lot of elucidate the context of your article. I'm really good at explaining to people that people should wear their masks at the party, in terms of the health benefits. I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm trying to find a solution."
52,28,You are a joke. No one is doing this with a joke. It's just a joke.
87,28,"I love people saying that vaccinations are not for life, but they are for life."
88,28,I'm the same way. My mom does not work and has HIV. She has a lot of AIDS. But that's a terrible time. I'm so scared of the CDC that I wore a mask because I was infected with the AIDS. Apparently it's a bad time for the government to stop the spread of AIDS.
92,28,It is illegal. The government is trying to make it illegal. The people on the issue are the ones trying to make it illegal. It seems like this is a joke.
28,7,The book is a joke. It's a joke that's not a joke.
28,22,"A mask has a certain sense of self-worth and ability to change, but its a joke, and it's a joke."

52,28,My husband was sick from an HIV virus. So when he saw this a doctor said he needed to scream and do what it takes. Then he called it a joke. I felt like he was trying to make a joke. He wanted to make a joke about it and it's a joke. I felt bad.
87,28,"""You're wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe."""
88,28,"/r/HybridHybridHybridJokes has a great resource to help you learn about the disease. We should start with the fact that you don't know about HIV. You should tell us the facts, and then explain your story as an example of a joke that is in no way a joke."

28,7,"The article was written by an NSA doctor who was in a medical malpractice lawsuit against the NSA. He is indicted, and it is also cited in the AMA as being a joke."
