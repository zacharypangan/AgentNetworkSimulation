57,56,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
60,56,please wear a mask and bend over
67,56,please mask up and maintain social distance people
73,56,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
77,56,wholeheartedly agree in the last weeks i have had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask
86,56,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
89,56,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
98,56,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,So...what are you using to say the same things? Do you know where this is going?
56,10,">I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,15,If you need any more information about this vaccine.
56,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate
56,18,It was in a public place and in public places and everyone knew the truth.
56,31,I understand what you mean by that but I do not believe this vaccine is the right thing to do. And he's clearly just trying to make a statement that is based on a false conclusion.
56,45,Doing the right thing would probably be good for the health of the county in a pinch.
56,47,I’d say that the best thing is that there isn’t any good reason for people to not wear a mask. This is just so fucking awesome he s doing this in a terrible way that no one would fucking like.
56,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,53,"A statewide mask mandate, though very weak and very likely to become a permanent threat if adopted by states or counties would be the least of the problems."
57,56,You do realize that most people aren't immune to the symptoms attributed to a virus or a weakened immune system? The only exception that this has to be a rule is to go a walk in the morning and leave your face in the cold. That's one of the most dangerous ways to be ill.
60,56,"You can do it at any time you want, as long as you don't have the scars or the pain of a concussion."
67,56,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,56,So you think wearing a mask will stop the spread of the virus?
77,56,Do you have a mask? I mean it should be a mask for someone whose mother has died of a contagious disease?
86,56,"You could put a helmet on and wear it outside to protect yourself, or just make a mask on yourself to keep you in shape."
89,56,Hey shave your face in the morning if you have one!
98,56,"oh boy, how weird. I never wear them anymore but I'm not wearing one because i'm so hot and have no one around to take care of me."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,"If a doctor has a vaccine to help a sick person, he needs to see the doctor. I've never had a bad experience with a sick person, but that's how it goes - in a lot of cases."
56,10,"I don't think you should wear a mask, or the only option is to leave your face in the cold. This is one of the most dangerous ways to be ill."
56,15,So...what are you using to say the same things? Do you know where this is going?
56,16,"In terms of health care in your county, I would not recommend using a mask to protect yourself from HIV/AIDS."
56,18,That was the last thing he ever asked me when I was about to be in a big emergency room when I was sick.
56,31,If you want to hear a doctor say that someone who didn't go to an area to be vaccinated could possibly get a concussion.
56,45,"I am just telling you that if the government tried to push a vaccine to stop a virus, it would be much better to be out in the cold with your face and have a helmet."
56,47,">I’m so sorry mark but i don’t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere ', 'I’d say that the best thing is that there isn’t any good reason for people to not wear a mask."
56,51,"Is there any real reason to not wear a mask? Because in my opinion, wearing a mask is really more effective. It's not even as effective as a statewide mask mandate. The fact that he didn't say that is wrong. Does he have any objective reason to not wear a mask?"
56,53,I hate to be the one to say that...But I d really like to go to bed every morning!
57,56,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

86,56,"The only way to get vaccines is to go to the doctor and get tested for it, then to have them removed, or else they will wear a mask for another month. I don't think that is a valid idea, but I do want to see how this will work. Wearing a mask or helmet does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
89,56,You're being so literal in that you don't want to use your face. You have to shave your face in the morning.
98,56,"A fat lip is a way to protect your skin, mainly against the spread of a virus. I think it's the same saying. A fat lip and a man without a face, or some combination of both, can both be a sign of an autoimmune disorder. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.

56,15,... and then he says I think that this is something that has been made public and is intended to be done in order to help those people. So I think that he's being so literal in that he's being so literal in that he don't want to use his face in the morning.

Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,53,And the masks are not going to be used for statewide health care.
57,56,"I was vaccinated for a very severe flu. In the UK, that was a very common scenario. Then the virus spread to everyone."
60,56,"No, the people who wear a mask aren't the ones who go about wearing a mask and bend over. They wear a mask and bend over. They wear a mask and bend over. The government doesn't really do that."
67,56,"I think you know the problem, you should wear a mask."
73,56,A federal mask mandate would be a good idea.
77,56,"I'm so sorry Mark, but I've a really, really bad feeling about this vaccine."
86,56,There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines.
89,56,"I can't think of anything else but a couple of things that make me think of you. My wife was in a similar situation, and they both have been wearing a mask. My dad would always tell us to wear a mask when he was sick to prevent infections. I was so annoyed at him that I thought he was so embarrassed that he would wear a mask when he was sick and not have to shave it. He was surprised at the fact that I thought his hair looked as dirty as a man, so I just used it."
98,56,Is it weird that your friend made you wear a mask on your face and is putting it on?

56,10,"Well, in the US, you'd still have to go through a whole process of ensuring that someone in the US isn't exposed to the disease, so we're not denying the fact that people who aren't exposed to the disease are on the hook for a concussion, but I'm not sure if it would make any difference. But I do know that there's a lot of science to be found about vaccines."
56,15,"I had a friend that told me that in order to stop this, she must wear a mask on her face. That she doesn't trust the government and wants the public to be involved. We talked about the problem because he felt he was ignoring the facts and trying to smuggle facts into his mouth."
56,16,A bit of the joke here: a guy wearing a mask is gonna throw a concussion on your face and a swiss woman's face.
56,18,"That's what I'm going to do. Have you tried some of the masks in the picture, and what's the difference?"
56,31,"""...and then he says I think that this is something that has been made public and is intended to be done in order to help those people. I think that he's being so literal in that he doesn't want to use his face in the morning."

I wore a mask once when I was sick to protect myself from an infection. I wasn't really sure how long I had been wearing it."
56,47,It sounds like you are gonna be left out in the cold.
56,51,""" Is it weird that your friend made you wear a mask on your face and is putting it on?"""
56,53,"No, it is not the problem. If a doctor has a vaccine to help a sick person, he needs to see the doctor."
57,56,This isn't a joke. It's an issue.
60,56,"Well, I think you need to make a mental note: You are essentially saying that the person who was trying to prevent the spread of the virus is the one who did it. And this isn't a joke."
67,56,">We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000."
73,56,I don't even know how a guy can say that.
77,56,"So you're trying to say, ""Oh, let's go over the details here, please."" It's a very weird part to be honest. The wording is really wrong. A mask is not a good thing."
86,56,"Vaccines are pretty common, mainly to help the body get healthy. A mask can be used to prevent people who are sick from getting infected."
89,56,"IANAL, but I have no idea why I hate wearing a mask. I do know that the government has been trying to prevent and stop the spread of a virus.

56,1,"The US has a lot of anti-viral drugs as well as some pretty serious diseases, like AIDS and the like."
56,10,"This is one of those posts that just sounded like some kind of kind of nonsense, but it's one of those where you've said you don't trust the government and want the public to be involved."
56,15,That's how the shitballs got started.
56,16,"As someone who has been infected with the flu, I can assure you that you have never been infected with the virus. There are other kinds of viruses that can kill you, but I believe that your friend is putting a mask on your face. That is essentially saying that you are going to die from the virus, and it makes you think that people will pass the virus on and not get the virus. It isn't a joke, but it's the right thing to say."
56,18,">We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. I don't even know how a guy can say that."
56,31,I don't get why they keep people with HIV in public health. Its pretty common to put people in sick areas and then have them on their side.
56,45,"“>I don't believe that we are seeing a virus, only a doctor who is in the U.S....?... and then he says I think that Well, in the US, you'd still have to go through a whole process of ensuring that someone in the US isn't exposed to the disease, so we're not denying the fact that people who aren't exposed to the disease are on the hook for a concussion."

56,53,The article outlines several things about the vaccination policy in the state.
57,56,"Vaccines aren't needed in the US, but it has to do with pandemics."
60,56,The government isn't doing anything that is in the public interest. The problem is people like you are making an obvious point about the government. I've never heard of the government that doesn't do that.
67,56,"'We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000."
73,56,You're just being a dick. We're not here to tell the truth.
77,56,"Well, you have a lot of right to be concerned, and the thing about the vaccine being a joke isn't the truth. You're the one that says that """
86,56,"You can wear a helmet and a mask. You could put a mask on and wear it outside to protect yourself, or just make a mask on yourself to keep you in shape."
89,56,I'm a total nutjob.
98,56,"I think your husband's gf is making the most of your comment - but if you're an honest person, then you're missing the point of this whole thread."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I am not a government official."
56,10,I read this as the guy that lied about the virus and then got very pissed off about it. I had the same thoughts if that's what the guy said. He said a lot.
56,15,>Is he being irresponsible?
56,16,It isn't the right thing to say. This is a nebulous situation.
56,18,A few months ago a guy blew my mind. It was just a joke he made to get out and help a neighbor. They tried to resuscitate me by telling me to wash the hand. It was the fucking joke he meant. It's not like he's blatantly lying about it or anything.
56,31,You sound like a nutjob and you're clearly being a dick. What do you think? You can't trust anyone to protect your health. You don't trust people who aren't infected with the virus.
56,45,">I'm a total nutjob. I think your husband's gf is making the most of your comment - but if you're an honest person, then you're missing the point of this whole thread."
56,47,I wore a mask for the first time on a date.
56,51,"Getting a vaccine is not what you need in a healthy population, but a bit of a big issue."
56,53,"I know I've been sick, but I am a few months into life, and I have the feeling that the doctors are putting their hands on the sick, and you are right about that. The guy is saying he's being irresponsible, and he is lying, and he's really insecure about the way things are supposed to be done."
57,56,"The first part of this isn't a joke, it's a legitimate idea. It's about the lack of a protection system."
60,56,"I know that the most annoying part of this is people don't want to see this guy. But, you know what I mean. It's not really a joke."
67,56,"Yes, it can stop the spread of the virus. The government has done so to deter a lot of these people from getting sick, they are actually doing a good job at that and they need to make sure the people who can t eat or drink it are safe and they can do that, so there's no need to act like they're just trying to fix the problem."
73,56,"The fact that the people in his city are on his watch list and that is why they need to abide by the law is beyond me. The ""Made in Texas"" policy."
77,56,">I'm a person who was recently diagnosed with HIV, and I think I may need to learn how to use the mask. I am currently on an AIDS-preventive drug treatment program. I don't know how to make it sound that way."
86,56,"People don't like having to wear a mask, unless there is a vaccine available. Or it may just be because they don't want to go outside."
89,56,"They're really not about the virus. They are about the people that are wearing the mask, not the government."
98,56,"I'm sorry to say this, but your friend has done a good job of proving that he's going to continue to use it when necessary. You sound quite rude, and you could use some constructive criticism of it, but the way you're describing it sounds like you're trying to push a little side of the envelope."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""I'm not a doctor, but I am not a government official."""
56,10,"I know a lot of people who don't wear masks, but that's just it. I think a couple of things aren't as important to us as the vaccine."
56,15,"I'm not sure if I understand what the word ""responsible"" means in the context of this, but I see a lot of people who think wearing a mask is stupid. The word mask is a valid word."
56,16,"I'm going to go on and tell you what I can't really understand. I have a bit of a problem with my mask, the amount of times I use it is outrageous. It's a gimmicky joke, but it works."
56,18,You have done what's right.
56,31,"Wearing a mask does not help the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps it spread AIDS, it's useless and I hate it."

56,47,People who don't wear masks are probably very sick.
56,51,"What do you think about the vaccine being outlawed? If they are not, then why does anyone have to go through the ""Made in Texas"" thing to get vaccinations?"
56,53,">The first part of this isn't a joke, it's a legitimate idea."
57,56,I think it's a joke and the only way it's supposed to work is to be cool and sarcastic.
60,56,"I can relate to the guy, he's trying to do something for us (like get our face a crinkle) and I want to be able to wear a mask. I've seen people doing that. I hate it and don't want to be around other people and people in the US who think it's a joke and don't see what it's about."
67,56,"This is a good point, and a great one, that I'd have to disagree with."
73,56,This is not the most important thing in Texas. He's a pedophile and he's not even on the statewide mask mandate. The statewide mask mandate does not apply to Texans in the US.
77,56,"Well, let's try and figure out where the ""I'm not a lawyer, but I think you have a right to a full body mask. You need to learn how to use it. I have a mask."
86,56,"I think i read this as ""We are just doing this to help people get healthy."""
89,56,YAY. TIL.
98,56,"I mean, the joke is, when I'm not dressed with a mask, that I'm still dressing. But it's funny to wear a mask for no reason at all."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,"So in other news, I've heard that Texans who wear a mask can get a concussion. They think they have a good idea, or at least an idea that is possible."
56,10,I don't understand why we are getting sick in America and why we need to wear masks to avoid being hit with the virus. I don't know how to feel about the vaccination program. I'm not sure what the point of wearing a mask is. It's the most important part of our health care system.
56,15,"Well, let's try and figure out where the ""I'm not a lawyer, but I think you have a right to a full body mask. You need to learn how to use it. I have a mask. I think i read this as ""We are just doing this to help people get healthy."""

56,51,Isn't it obvious that your friend didn't make you wear a mask? Because he obviously lied and is lying and is being rude.
56,53,"In Texas, people do NOT have to get vaccinated in order to get HIV. But there is something about it that makes them sick - they can not give you HIV or something like that."
57,56,"I'm not sure if you read any of the comments, but I've seen them."
60,56,"If it's a joke, it's a joke. And not just for a joke. Whether or not you want to be around others doesn't matter."
67,56,"> The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
73,56,>The whole Texan thing is so big that it needs to be explained.
77,56,"CANNOTANSWER: Vaccines are not a gimmick, and they are meant to help TB patients get a little safer."
86,56,My father and I were vaccinated for TB last year. The CDC and their partner are trying to prevent the spread of the illness. Basically the government is using the CDC's medical knowledge to get us infected.
89,56,"No one wears a mask, because there's a danger in it."

56,18,"I would like to tell you that the CDC is using the medical knowledge of the health department to bring a patient with TB to the hospital in a medical mask. TB can be a very serious condition, especially after a traumatic childhood."
56,31,"> So in other news, I've heard that Texans who wear a mask can get a concussion."
56,45,"The best way to get rid of this virus is to put a mask on your face while in the cold. You don't have to wear it, you can take off the mask, and then put a mask on afterward."

56,45,"Well, your husband's gf is joking."

67,56,Why is it silly? Why are people willing to pay for it?
73,56,It seems as though this is the reason why a mask must be required if a government agency is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They don't do anything about it

67,56,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick.
73,56,The only reason a mask is an effective panacea is because of a government's incompetence.
77,56,A mask is not a gimmick. They are meant to stop the spread of a virus.
86,56,It is an interesting exercise. It's an exercise in how to understand the situation and explain the issues.

77,56,I'm a doctor. I would get a fecal virus vaccine. But a mask can't help prevent them from spreading. The mask can also help treat certain infections that the public cannot treat. A mask can stop the spread of the virus. I'm not sure that it's something to worry about. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to make a doctor feel bad about his apprehensions but he could be right about wearing a mask to prevent infection.

56,16,The CDC is trying to spread a joke but it's being a gimmick.

56,31,"I don't know if that's correct or not but you're right, I would be very concerned about someone exposing their face to the cold, especially if the person is infected. They don't know. And you aren't infected."
56,45,Your friend who uses a mask to protect herself and her boyfriend from the spread of AIDS in public is a nutjob. You don't seem to care. You don't care.
56,47,In the end the medical issue is the right of the person to wear a mask without their consent. He can’t possibly get infected if he is going to get sick or if he is a child in that case. You could get your fecal virus shot if he is on your side. In the end he is a pedophile.

98,56,> I was afraid that someone would see me wearing a mask and the CDC would have no interest in me wearing one. I was referring to a joke that has a bad name but the whole story is so absurd that I don't know the context of it.
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,A lot of people will come to the CDC to have a conversation about the facts about the CDC using the mask.
56,10,So when do I find the CDC and government that I work for?
56,15,I would not consider it a joke. But it is one of those things.
56,16,The whole thing blew me away.
56,18,The entire post is about the fact that the CDC did not make an AMA and they are trying to make a joke out of it.
56,31,- I've heard that people who wear a mask can get a concussion.
56,45,I am a doctor and I am just going to share my views on this...

57,56,Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician.
60,56,I would have never been a doctor if i wasn't in the hospital because of the jokes and it doesn't have a real purpose.
67,56,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick. People would go to a hospital and get sick if they tried.
73,56,This isn't a great way to discuss AIDS. It isn't a good way to talk to AIDS or the CDC or to talk to a doctor. It's a ridiculous way to talk about AIDS.
77,56,"I think the joke i was thinking of was: ""Do you have a mask? I mean it should be a mask for someone whose mother has died of a contagious disease?"""
86,56,AMA is a joke. It's a joke.
89,56,I don't wear a mask because I'm sick. They don't want to. I think they're uncomfortable for them to wear.

56,10,"Despite what some of these posts have said, my experience with the CDC is somewhat different than it's recent attempts."
56,15,I want to make a joke about how people think that. But I can't understand what that is.
56,16,"Having said that, I really don't understand the point of the AMA."
56,18,"As far as I understand it is being misused to be the most funny thing on the internet - I've seen and heard of dozens of examples of such ridiculous misuse that has gone unnoticed, but is completely legitimate."
56,31,I can't tell you why I'm a doctor. But a doctor can tell a doctor that a mask doesn't help the spread of a virus. A doctor can tell someone that a mask isn't sufficient to stop the spread of a virus. A doctor cannot tell someone that a mask is enough to stop the spread of a virus.
56,45,"""... if you have a mask on your face while in the cold. You don't have to wear it, you can take off the mask, and then put a mask on afterward."""
56,47,The CDC is trying to make a joke out of this.
56,51,"The CDC, in this case, is making a joke about the AIDS crisis he was in and is getting sick, and is trying to fuck them."
56,53,There's a lot of overlap between the two problems.
57,56,"It's a joke, but it shouldn't be funny. Vaccines aren't the only thing that is dangerous and obnoxious."
60,56,I can't even imagine the guy wearing a mask and I'm not a doctor.
67,56,"I think this isn't a joke, but I'm saying if I'm going to have to laugh then I'm going to do it anyway because I can't get sick because I don't get sick from a medical mask."
73,56,The CDC doesn't care about you because it's a problem. The CDC's mandate does. It's basically how the public perceives its actions.
77,56,A mask is not a gimmick. They are not a gimmick.
86,56,"""Hi! Aren't you sick of TB? You're sick of TB!"""
89,56,"I just want to say that the person who made the joke, and made it up about what they think, is an unreliable, naive person, which is one of the primary reasons why people should wear masks."
98,56,"I can't even describe this, but there are still people who are making fun of the jokes and this one isn't a joke."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
56,1,There's the fact that the CDC is trying to make a joke out of this.
56,10,... and if this is what CDC needs in order to be effective. And for the same reasons:
56,15,The problem with this is that a lot of people think that the government is doing something so bad. I would say that they are trying to make it funny to people in terms of making a joke about people putting masks on them.
56,16,AMA: Is this a joke?
56,18,The CDC is trying to make a joke out of it.
56,31,"I think it's a good idea for the government to take the time to educate people about this, but it also sounds like it is a naive joke."
56,45,This is an AMA. This is a joke.
56,47,People can wear a mask in the summer. That is a very real danger.
56,51,"I have to say that I'm not a lawyer, but I know the CDC isn't the best place to start. And the CDC isn't the best place for people to learn about it."
56,53,"I just want to say that the person who made the joke, and made it up about what they think, is an unreliable, naive person, which is one of the primary reasons why people should wear masks. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
57,56,A doctor who was in the hospital with a contagious disease in a public hospital in his home had a very severe infection and he was not immune to it. He is a doctor so he is concerned about his family.
60,56,"There are plenty of people who are vaccinated, and some who aren't."
67,56,This is why a mask is a joke.
73,56,The CDC is doing nothing with the AIDS/HIV ACA.
77,56,"I've always wanted a ""Masked Mandate"" but the idea of a ""Masked Mandate"" is so obnoxious that it seems like it's a joke."
86,56,"The issue here isn't that it's a joke, it's that a joke is just a gimmick. The question is that it's about the government, and it isn't the government. It's the government. It's not about the government. The question is whether or not there is anything wrong with the AMA. It's about the CDC and the world's population."
89,56,"There's another snoopy joke on here. It's called the 'What's the point of a petty title? ''I don't want to say that the person who made the joke, and made it up about what they think, is an unreliable, naive person, which is one of the primary reasons why people should wear masks."
98,56,"I've been doing this for about 9 years. I hate being on my face in public and putting on the mask I feel like a shitload of people are going to think I'm being stupid. I just don't see the point of any of this, but I'm getting downvoted for it. I just like being on my face for a bit."
101,56,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

56,18,"I believe that if the CDC had made a joke, it could be a joke. The way I understand it, the question is whether or not the CDC needs to do something that would make a joke."
56,31,I have a mask in my hands and I have to go up to the doc to wear it because it's not necessary to stay healthy.
56,45,"IANAL but I've always wanted to go to the CDC. But that's not the point of an AMA. I just want to say that the person who made the joke is an unreliable, naive person, which is one of the primary reasons why people should wear a mask."
56,47,The point is that you're a lawyer. That's a ridiculous excuse for a lawyer to get a doctor to prescribe an antiviral to help a concussion victim. It's a joke.
56,51,"I don't see what the problem is with the joke, but the joke is about the government."
56,53,You're not going to change your minds. We should be able to make the whole issue a reality.
57,56,Vaccines aren't legal in the US.
60,56,There is a joke of the type that is a dick in the face. The problem is a joke about the aforementioned blunder.

56,45,A joke is an idea. They're trying to explain the reason they don't need a mask. They don't want to take advantage of what they see happening. They want to get the vaccine. They want a joke to get it.
56,47,No. There is no legal exemption for a concussion victim.

I believe they believe that because they don't have any empathy for those with HIV/AIDS, the government will make that joke ridiculous.

57,56,Vaccines are not legal in the US unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required in other countries too. The CDC is a private agency. The CDC does not have to change it.
60,56,The whole thing is a joke. It's not a joke. It's a way of telling a story.

89,56,a friend of mine used to wear a mask when he was sick to prevent the spread of the virus. the truth is that he was a pedophile. he just couldn't help the virus spread. it was a snoopy joke.

98,56,"It seems that the reason a man wears a mask is because he is afraid of HIV and it makes him feel uncomfortable, but because he doesn't know what it is it is pretty funny. He seems like an asshole. The idea of a man wearing a mask means that he fucks a man. The idea is that he is more likely to go to the doctor if he is concerned with it. The idea isn't funny, but there are a lot of people in the meds who wear a mask."

56,15,It is a joke. We don't want to fight it. We need a doctor or a doctor or something to keep the disease at bay. We are referring to it as a 'fake joke' because we have no idea what it is. We have an official policy that people with HIV who have been infected with HIV have to wear a full body mask to stop the spread of AIDS. We don't have an official policy because we cannot keep the virus at bay.
56,16,I think you're referring to the one part where Mark explains that he's going to put on a mask. He says he thinks that it helps people. He says he is a very good friend but he's trying to make people feel better so he can make the best of it.

56,15,It doesn't seem like the CDC has a legitimate policy for the prevention of AIDS.

86,56,The people in question are not saying that the article is a joke.

56,1,"I'm a lawyer who works in the public health system. I've a couple of friends that have gotten sick from smoking weed because they feel like they're immune to a variety of medical conditions.

56,51,">The CDC, in this case, is making a joke about the AIDS crisis he was in and is getting sick, and is trying to fuck them."

56,10,"In the US, it is a joke, not a joke. I've seen it, but the US AMAs and the AMA have gotten very bad. People seem to be taking things literally. You're a joke."
