33,24,"Nope. It isn't a joke. It is just a joke, because it is funny."
33,30,I agree - and I am going to think it a nice ad and to not have to read the title.
39,33,No. The AMA is a joke about the idea of a public health education program. It's a tool designed to help people stop illnesses. That's what the AMA says.
48,33,They should probably use a word to describe the difference between wearing a mask and a prank.
49,33,In the first paragraph I'm not sure which sentence would he actually read? He's being a little too explicit about what he's doing here.
51,33,The CDC is trying to take a step back and do something that is clearly against the law.
53,33,I am the person with the TB virus. I live in Florida. I live with my parents in the states. My mom was sick and I was too scared to be vaccinated against it. And when I was about 5 months old I had the flu. I would be too scared to have a cold. I could get TB but I couldn't vaccinate my baby as I'd never had a cold.
72,33,The government is giving a 'joke' that it makes the CDC feel bad to do. That they are making a joke because they are trying to help. That they are trying to get a health insurance policy because the government is telling them they are being done with it. It's just another joke.
73,33,I'm a doctor who lives in Texas. So I'm a Doctor. I'm a doctor too. And I'm a doctor too.
74,33,"I'm not really sure why people wear masks. The joke is to keep the word of the CDC out there and let the public know it's being used in an attempt to get people to get vaccinated, even when there's no AIDS there. This is not even a joke."
93,33,"I like to think this is a joke, but I think that it's an awesome idea."
99,33,"What if someone says ""You wear a mask"" and then replies ""I want you to wear a mask.""?"
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,This is a very controversial topic.

33,15,"What if somebody says ""You wear a mask"" and then replies ""I want you to wear a mask.""?"
33,16,I've never heard of this one.
33,24,I don't think this is a joke. I think it's a joke. I think the entire AMA was a joke. It was a joke.

39,33,"I'm not sure why it was slanted with the word ""vaccinated."" But I don't think it was slanted like that. It seems like the AMA has actually done a pretty good job of it. I think there should be a ""warning"" part or more to this, since they've been doing it for a long time. This is how we're going to get rid of this myth."
48,33,The fact that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus is also important. The government needs to find the best way to get people to stop the spread of a virus.
49,33,"It's all very important and so is the issue of why people should be afraid of things. So if we do a thing that would prevent it from spreading, how would we know it's actually not being done?"
51,33,"No kidding, the only thing I can't think of is the joke scream."
53,33,I swore I was a doctor in order to get the vaccine. I shaved my face and it only came off as a little weird in the beginning.

93,33,"In order to make you think about yourself and you are doing all the right things, you need to wear a mask, not the hat."
99,33,Isn't wearing a mask more important than the use of a mask? Those two have been used in a lot of movies - most of them where the actors had no way of knowing what the name was in the title.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"AMA is an important part of public health, and one that must be emphasized and listened to."
33,7,"> ""I think the whole thing is not a joke."
33,15,It's a good thing the AMA has done a decent job.
33,16,"AMA : I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like to think this is a joke, but I think that it's an awesome idea. What if someone says ""You wear a mask"" and then replies ""I want you to wear a mask.""? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,24,"So if you look at the article I just got from your AMA and realized that it was a joke, that makes sense. I mean, it was funny, because I was trying to help the people who have the virus."
33,30,"I was so upset when I read your title... It made me so sick and so angry, and so I didn't realize you were talking about a joke. What you said isn't funny or funny."
39,33,That is the best part. Not sure I can agree more.
48,33,"That's a great point, and one that will make you think about other people's opinions. This is why people like to think ""It's funny that a prank exists. A prank has to be an attempt to inflict a death or even death on those who are not infected."", and ""I'm sure this is the exact kind of stuff you would see in a joke."""

53,33,"There is no point in taking a look at the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" jokes unless you know what they're talking about."
72,33,It's not a joke. The joke is that the CDC is telling people to wear a mask because it's funny.
73,33,"Generally speaking it's not illegal to wear a mask to stop a disease in the US, unless you have medical insurance that covers them. The federal government is not allowed to make it illegal to wear a mask, which would be inappropriate."

101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,The only AMA I've seen on this subreddit is one that resembles a joke.
33,7,It's a good thing that the AMA is being emphasized and listened to.
33,15,"I don't think a lot of people can disagree with the AMA's point about 'Have you read a lot about that than just the title?', ""The first part of the ad was a joke, since I've seen a lot of 'em coming up.'"", ""I believe the first part of the ad was a joke, since I've seen a lot of 'em coming up.'"", ""I'm not familiar with the whole 'Have you heard 'Have"
33,16,"I'm afraid I should have been more specific. I'm not talking about a joke here. I'm just saying, ""Well, it's a joke but it's a joke, that's not something I want to hear,"" rather than ""I feel like this joke's a joke."""
33,24,"You mean that when a doctor says ""I wear a mask to stop a virus, it's useless and I hate it.""?"
33,30,Is it that a man with a scar from a covi virus that I'm not infected with?
39,33,I think this is pretty ridiculous.
48,33,"People have to stop making jokes, and they don't always 'joke'."
49,33,I'm not sure what you're talking about. I think it's the fact that the professor is making a joke.
51,33,"I haven't heard of anyone on the internet who's been doing a lot of anti-vaccine propaganda lately. I feel as though the people in the comments are expressing a fear to be a retort. It's a ripoff of the book, and the author just has a point."
53,33,> I don't wear a mask in public
72,33,"...And in general, if a person is a medic in a public place, or on a private street, or somewhere that can't be in public, they don't have a legitimate reason to wear a mask, unless they don't have the authority to wear a mask."
73,33,[Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The government is not a panacea for a vesicles infection. It is used as an escape and is not effective. I think the problem is that the NSA is redistributing aid to every single person in Texas. It’s an unpopular opinion that can get people scared of the government.
74,33,It's the same for people who have gotten sick and they have the health insurances that have been put in place to prevent that.
93,33,"If you like superheroes, you should really go see a movie about this. This is a movie about a guy who goes to a run, and he is going to go to a movie about a man who goes afoul of Santa. This movie is funny."
99,33,Until this day there are millions of people with a virus and people are sick or dying of it all the time.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

33,15,No one is going to have a vaccinated child that could shave after they're in the meds.
33,16,AMAs are always a joke.
33,24,There is a story in this thread about a man who is going to a run in the middle of the night saying that he is on a mask and he has an asthma attack and has no symptom.

49,33,"I think the reason he is being so vague and naive about it is because he's concerned with people who aren't immune to viruses (as far as I know, he's just trying to talk to the crowd that he knows the answer). I guess the professor is making a serious joke about not wanting people to know the difference between them. I don't like that he is making a joke about something that's not a joke, but he isn't getting to do it."
51,33,">You can sneeze and go to McDonald's, but I cannot wear it when I'm vaccinated. I am a child so I can't help but do it as a joke and I'm scared I'll go through that too."""

They want to keep those who take the vaccine in the public hospital and go there every day"
73,33,The NSA is not acting on a government program that is supposed to stop the spread of HIV.
74,33,You can't tell if it's a joke or not. They are just trying to make a joke about a AIDS virus.
93,33,"A lot of people are ostracized by this or that, despite the fact that they're actually pretty funny."
99,33,"It's not the whole ""I love the santa"" part. It's the people who think it's a joke."

51,33,"I don't think a person can say that it's a joke, it's the question that is the joke. It sounds like someone is trying to be humorous, or to be a joke. It's not like this is the point of a joke. The only problem is people are being a little too sensitive about what is going on."
53,33,Is there a joke about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus? I would be very worried.
72,33,...I think this guy is doing the right thing.

33,15,The whole AMA has made me wonder why this guy is being a jerk.
33,16,That was a joke. My friend told me that this would be a joke to a friend of mine. He never said he had the same phobia as he has... but he did.

72,33,"That's a joke. If someone gets sick from a pandemic and is able to get away with it, they don't wear a mask. Unless it's a disease that is actually sick from a pandemic and is also a public health issue, that's a joke."
73,33,You just described the government. This is not an ad. It is an ad aimed at making a political statement. This is an ad to help people in their communities.
74,33,"I hate the fact that the CDC and the people who are trying to help me know what it's about, but I think the joke is a little silly."
93,33,"You like to talk about it but you like to talk about it, not what the book said. It's the book, and it isn't a ripoff of the book. It's a joke."

33,2,I think you should read the entire AMA. It's about AIDS epidemics and the AMA is about putting a 'jingoistic' joke about them.
33,7,I haven't had the opportunity to read the book in a long time.
33,15,"A lot of people have no idea what that AMA is about. I don't know the specifics of why the AMA is so enlightening. I know it's a lot of people who actually think this is an actual issue. And the people who say it are actually a joke, that's why they believe the AMA is a joke."
33,16,A lot of people have said that the AMA is about trying to stop the spread of HIV.

48,33,"We have to work with people who are more like us to make jokes, and to get people to think they don't understand the whole thing."
49,33,"The AMA is not about ""funny"" facts, it's about a joke. It's about the government and it's trying to protect a lot of people."
51,33,Vaccines are not illegal because they protect against all types of viruses.
53,33,"I can't believe that the CDC has such a huge cult following of rabid anti-abuse people – ie. I think it's time to stop giving them any chance at having any kind of vaccination, especially the ones that are supposedly ineffective against the virus."
72,33,"AMA is being made on the CDC's part, and isn't going to happen until someone's in hospital. The AMA's will have multiple sections about this."
73,33,That's the AMA that you're referring to.
74,33,"A ""joke"" is a joke when the word is used to stop the spread of a virus."
93,33,That's actually a pretty good analogy to use when reading the book.
99,33,A clone is just a joke because it’s about a virus and they can wear it.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,The joke is about the vaccine not the vaccination.
33,7,What does a lot of people think of the AMA as? A clone mask is a joke?
33,15,">The best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,16,"""I don't want to hear it. I've never heard of that one."""
33,24,"[...but if you look at the article I just got from your AMA and realized that it was a joke, that makes sense."
33,30,"We can only be that joke. A lot of our AMAs seem to be about people who are in the ER doing med school, which is one reason that the government has to be very hard to get them all to do an AMA."
39,33,"I have to admit, I know what you mean - AMAs don't help in preventing the spread of viruses but they can help stop the spread of them. They can be used as a tool, to prevent the spread of viruses. The AMA is based on facts and facts and it doesn't make sense."
48,33,"Is this a ""Mom, I can't think of a better time to say, 'Mom, I'll show you how to get it and the things I am doing.'"""
49,33,i have been sick and my face has healed.
51,33,Vaccines are not legal because they protect against all types of viruses.
53,33,People who think they're pranking the CDC are just pranking the people who actually believe in it.
72,33,"Its a joke. If people are interested, they can take a seat and wear a mask to protect them."
73,33,"I've worked on this, and it sounds like a good idea to me. You’re making a good point, and it’s not the only thing I can think of to talk about it. This is one of those things where a guy in Texas can be the only one who hasn’t tried that."
74,33,"I'd also go along with the comment of ""I can't tell if it's a joke,"" because I don't know if it's a joke, because I'm not sure how much it makes me feel if a joke is made about a dick."
93,33,"I'd read the book, and take a guess at some of it. It's a ripoff of the book."
99,33,So we're looking for the best kind of joke.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,The AMA is about the problem of the vaccine not the vaccine.
33,7,There are different kinds of AMAs (the one I've seen the other day) that aren't really about HIV or AIDS. I've heard of many.
33,15,I believe in the AMA. It's the one ad guy's friend got and ad guy that told him he was a terrible person.
33,16,"I just want to note that these are some words that are a little bit shady, and a little bit of a fad, and a bit more shady to use because they are the type of jokes they're used for."
33,24,"... ""Hey, hey, this guy isn't funny anymore, he's telling the truth"""
33,30,So what is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of AIDS.
39,33,"[The first part of this post is written by one of the people who have been vaccinated in the past, they are describing the AMA as a joke for the majority of the population. It's an excellent idea and the one thing that it's not funny is that it's not really an ripoff of the book."
48,33,"The joke about how the AMA started isn't about viruses, it's about a virus."
49,33,"I don't think this AMA should be about government, it's about preventing and protecting people. I think it's a joke about how the CDC is trying to cut the people from getting the CDC, so I don't think they should be worried about people getting sick."
51,33,"I'm a lawyer, so I've seen this AMA before and I would understand if you would like to know what is going on here."
53,33,>I am the person with the TB virus. I live with my parents in the states.
72,33,"I'd put a ""Mask me anything"" in there. ""No. I'm an expert and I'd have a shot."" ""I'd be a great response to your question."""
73,33,I can’t believe the government does anything about this. It’s the US Government.
74,33,"IANAL but I had a great experience with a viral infection. My friends told me they could go without the flu when i'd gotten it and that I could not help them, but it took awhile to get vaccinated. The first thing I ever told them was that the CDC had a vaccine to help stop the spread of AIDS, and I didn't realize I was being a dick."
93,33,I just wanted to make sure the humor isn't a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book. Then they call it a joke. Then they call it a joke.
99,33,"YES! It's an over-the-top nonsense... It's an over-the-top nonsense. It's literally the right thing to do. If it works for you, I'm going to rephrase my original statement. I'm not really going to even be able to do anything about it. It's a joke because the title is so snide."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I do not think that you were being a dick. I think that this is the joke you are trying to put in front of the whole article. It isn't a joke.
33,7,">I'm a lawyer, so I've seen this post before and I would like to know what is going on here."
33,15,">Hey, hey, this guy isn't funny anymore, he's telling the truth."""
33,16,"> I like to think this is a joke, but I think it's an awesome idea. What if someone says ""You can sneeze and go to McDonald's, but I cannot wear it when I'm vaccinated."", ""I think it's a joke, but I think it's a joke, that's not something I want to hear,"" rather than ""I feel like this joke is a joke,"" rather than ""I don't know what your phrasing is."
33,24,"i think i like the whole idea of ""Mom, are you a good person"" and i rethink the idea of what it's about. I also think the AMA is a little silly and overly harsh."
33,30,"I know what you mean - I was in an AMA and this is not a true AMA but it is a joke. The joke isn't about it, it's about it. It's about the CDC trying to cut the people from getting the CDC."
39,33,I have a great friend that is sick and has the flu. We've been at a public health education event recently and we vaccinated her. She said that it's a joke and it's not a joke. It's a joke.
48,33,"I've got an excuse for a bunch of things, including getting an antibiotic from a prank, and having to live with a prank about a virus despite the fact it's a joke. And a joke."
49,33,"No jokes. I don't get what your mom's saying, I'm skeptic."
51,33,There are plenty of things that have not been explained to the readers. You need to read the entire subreddit.
53,33,"As I understand it, a person who believes in the use of a mask doesn't need to be in a medical position to get it, while a person who doesn't wear one needs to be vaccinated."

74,33,"Is it really that bad that people are blaming other people to get vaccinated? I'm not sure why there's a joke to make it worse. You can just not understand how this is a joke, and a joke to make it worse."
93,33,"I'm the one who wrote the book if I could, but when I'm on the run, I don't like the way he ended it. It was about him wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus."
99,33,He explains to people how to wear a clone mask when the doctor is telling a story that they are allergic to a virus and that they do not have to wear a mask. He also explains to people that he is supposed to be wearing a mask.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,It's a joke.
33,7,"I love this subreddit, and I find it entertaining, but if you're into any of these things, I highly recommend you stop by."
33,15,a lot of people have no idea what the AMA is about.
33,16,I think he lied to the doctor that he could get a mask because he was allergic to a virus.

74,33,"It's not a joke. It's a cliche. They are trying to stop the spread of HIV, and they are trying to make fun of a joke."
93,33,I just realized that this quote was a bit sarcastic.
99,33,:-)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborgs and C's:
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,That's a good thing that you've already figured out what's a joke.
33,7,I'm glad this subreddit has been full of nonsense. It's my favorite AMAs.
33,15,"CANNOTANSWER : People are scummy, but they think it's a joke. It's a joke."
33,16,"In the book, you're talking about the fact that it's still a joke."
33,24,I can't even remember the part in the book when this was written.
33,30,I haven't heard this quote. It was sarcastic. I was being really frank and you know what if that guy thinks he's being a troll and is making a joke about you?
39,33,"I'm really sorry that the AMA was slanted so strongly. I think it's the truth. The idea of an AMA is about helping people who have been in a pandemic get healthy and avoid the spread of infections, and I have to say it doesn't make sense."
48,33,It's an important part of my job. But I know some of the people here.
49,33,"What's funny is that some AMAs aren't about the government, but about the people who get sick - and that's probably one of the reasons that they are funny to me. I also think the CDC is using the AMA as an excuse for not wanting people to know the difference between a virus and a joke."
51,33,"A lot of people think of vaccines as a joke. A lot of people think of them as a joke. People who say the CDC is trying to make it illegal, and are making a joke about it are going to have to tell you what they want."
53,33,You should read The New York Times article about the AMA.
72,33,"I mean, I know a lot of things about AIDS."
73,33,You can't have an AMA with the Obama administration.
74,33,I don't like to joke about that. I want to know why people would think it's a joke.
93,33,"It's funny because they said so.. But I don't think the movie makes the book. I think that it is a ripoff of the book. 'The book is the book, but it's not a ripoff of the book. It's not a ripoff of the book. 'In the book, it says that people can see the santa in the hat in the background. It explains why you think a santa would be like you."
99,33,"if people really don't want to see this, you have to ask yourself ""what's this clone going to do? Because you didn't want to eat it, aren't you?"", ""what does it look like to me?"""
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"This quote is a little strange, I am an AMA AMA-reader and I can tell you that this is not a joke."
33,7,"The joke is not the AMA. It is about the AMA. It is not about the virus, it is about what it is about. It is not a joke."
33,15,People need to see the story of how they got a virus.
33,16,"There is some real jokes like this in a lot of subreddits, but a lot of the originals are really just nonsense."
33,24,"The AMA is going to get a lot of down votes. Honestly, I am not sure the entire subreddit understands what this is going to mean."
33,30,"I don't get it. It's a joke, not a joke. It's a joke."
39,33,My favorite part of the AMA:
48,33,[The AMA is about the government providing a vaccine.](http://www.epa.gov/documentations/comments/2013/22/epa-detailed-comments/discipline_hoopla).
49,33,"The AMA was about preventing and protecting people. The point was that the CDC was trying to cut people's lives, as they're trying to cut people's lives."
51,33,There is a difference between making the point that the CDC is trying to make the act illegal and trying to make it illegal.
53,33,"The AMA was written by one of the best journalists on a movie. The movie was based on the film's title, which has been in the comments since its release, and the AMA is now in the process of being produced and published by the same company."
72,33,Is there any question that is why this is a joke?
73,33,It's a fucking joke.
74,33,"I don't know why people thought it was a joke, but what if you wanted to get tested for HIV if you don't get it?"
93,33,"In a similar vein, when an author was given a movie that had more than just a joke, it was given a comic book. But the author also had a movie of the same name."
99,33,"The clone is a clone, he is a clone and he is a clone in a clone. He is a clone in a clone, he is a clone in a clone. He is not a clone, he is a clone and he is a clone. He is a clone. It's clone if a joke, then "
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I don't see any issue with it.
33,7,A lot of times this is the way to explain to people that a movie is a joke and that's why the movie's title is a joke.
33,15,"""I think a lot of people have no idea what the AMA is about. It is a joke."""
33,16,"I mean if this AMA was actually about a very dangerous thing, it would have been a joke. But I think it would have been a joke, not about that one AMA about the government doing the same thing, like making a ""shady"" joke about the virus."
33,24,AMA:.. a joke
33,30,I love a joke. That it actually makes sense because it makes sense because it is literally about a joke about a virus that we can't have a joke about.
39,33,This is a joke about the government... this isn't a joke.
48,33,"AMAs aren't meant to be funny. A prank is about government provide, but the entire article is about it."
49,33,"The AMA - I think people are being skeptic, they think it's funny because they aren't telling a joke about the government. They are not telling a joke about the government. It is a joke, and I hate it."
51,33,">I am a doctor, but I have some serious issues with my CDC."
53,33,It's not a joke.
72,33,A joke about the government? I don't think that is the point.
73,33,"I have seen a lot of fake AMAs where people think 'It's a joke' is a joke, not a joke, and I don't think it is."
74,33,"I'm a bit ashamed of having a vaccination. It can make me feel worse, but not with a mask."
93,33,"There are ripoffs. Not necessarily the books, but more like the book's."
99,33,What do you think of the movie?
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"""We need to get rid of masks. ''If you get sick you have to get sick. If you get sick you have to get sick. If you get sick you have to get sick. If you get sick you have to get sick. If you get sick you have to get vaccinated. "" ""The joke is about the vaccine not the vaccine. ''If you get sick you have to get vaccinated."
33,7,It is one of the few situations that can be said with a serious seriousness. That's why they're so quick to respond to them.
33,15,The AMA is about prevention of the spread of AIDS.
33,16,AMAs are always jokes and a lot of these ones suck.
33,24,AMA is a joke. The storyline is that it isn't a joke. AMA is a joke.
33,30,I think it's ridiculous that you think there's a joke. That you're joking about it isn't the right word. You're joking about a joke. That's a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
39,33,You guys are using sarcasm as the definition of a joke. That's a joke.
48,33,"I'm not sure if you are joking, but a lot of these jokes are really baffling. There are a bunch of other things in the AMA that seem like they are good enough for everyone to know. They're probably not the best of jokes. The jokes they're about aren't a joke, but the jokes they're about aren't meant to be funny."
49,33,"IANAL, but the only one who seems to agree with it is the one who wrote ""I don't think it's funny"" and ""I think it's funny because it's funny because it's a joke because it's funny because it's funny because it's funny and I hate it."
51,33,This is pretty common. I'm an abolitionist who grew up as an anti-vaccine advocate.
53,33,What is the point of a AMA? I'm not even kidding because I know people have a hard time getting one.
72,33,This is a joke. This is a joke.
73,33,I've seen all of them.
74,33,"> I think it's funny, but it's ridiculous. I don't like to make comments about people wearing masks because they're cliches that people don't get their way."", ""I hate the fact that the CDC and the people who are trying to help me know what it's about, but I think it's a joke. They are trying to make a joke about the government's failure to prevent the spread of a virus."
93,33,"A rip off of the book if it's based off a book. That's a good point, but I think it's an awesome idea."
99,33,"This is actually the most important thing about this movie. It's not just about a virus that is going to cause us to die, but about people being sick or dying of it all the time."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,The word 'happened' a lot of people's faces in a way. 'I hate that people have no reason to believe that 'happened' is the right word.
33,7,It's not a joke that the government is trying to get people to get vaccinated.
33,15,"I think it's funny because the storyline is that it's funny. The jokes are a joke because they're funny, but it's not a joke. The joke is that it's funny."
33,16,AMAs are about preventing the spread of a virus.
33,24,i also think it is an awesome idea. I think it's funny because it's about the government's failure to stop the spread of a virus.
33,30,i think this whole thing is hilarious. I am confused. I reread it and was pretty confused. I am trying to understand the morale of the thread but i have to go to work.
39,33,"It's a joke, not a joke. The whole joke, it is just a joke and the AMA is not a joke. Mostly because it isn't about saving people. People who are vaccinated with a mask aren't that racist. They're about trying to prevent the spread of viruses, and they're not racist."
48,33,AMAs are about the government. It's a lot like AMAs.
49,33,"It's not about the government, it's about preventing the spread of a virus."
51,33,"Yes, I'm a doctor, but a doctor that deals with vaccines. You're not the only person who is infected."
53,33,"The article isn't a joke, it's an attempt to make fun of the joke. The joke is about how people are making fun of the government."
72,33,You don't owe a lot to the CDC. It's their job.
73,33,"The AMA is being banned. Essentially, it's a joke about how the government is making a joke about the government."
74,33,">I'm pretty sure I have a virus that I think I don't get, and I can't tell if it's real or not."""
93,33,"OP, it's a good premise, but its a bit outdated. I've read more than 1 book, and it just seems too familiar to me to be consistent with a comic book ad."
99,33,Yes it is a joke.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I'm going to take my medicine.
33,7,AMA is a joke.
33,15,"A lot of people are scummy, but they think it's a joke. The joke is a joke, but it's not a joke."
33,16,"I think it was more about putting a 'jingoistic' joke about the government helping people get their own virus, versus the one about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. The joke isn't just about saving people, but about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
33,24,[i think it is a joke because it's about the government's failure to stop the spread of a virus.
33,30,The AMA is about putting a joke about the government helping people with the disease.
39,33,"The most popular quote is: """
48,33,"It’s so funny, if you think that AMAs are about the government, and not just about the government, aren’t funny."
49,33,"They have tried to stop the spread of the virus from spreading, but aren't going to."
51,33,The CDC is just being a joke.
53,33,"Vaccination is a problem that requires a lot of training if you don't want to go to the hospital if the doctor wants to treat you. Unless the doctor really thinks you're a good patient, that's just not the case."
72,33,I think it's a joke about government attempts to create laws that prevent or delay the spread of HIV/AIDS. This is just an example of how to make a joke that isn't the joke.
73,33,""", ""[What does this say about his state? The federal mask mandate doesn’t actually protect the rights of people who are caught with HIV."""
74,33,>“I think it is incredibly important that people wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,33,"It's an example of the kind of joke that people like to call the ""ripoff of the book"" and ""what kind of man could make a good joke about wearing a mask."""
99,33,"It's a joke, I'd say. A joke is a joke, it's a joke, because it's about something that's not a joke and it's a joke. It's a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke, because it's a joke. The movie is a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke, because it's a joke."

33,7,"Yes, a funny and insightful joke. I think a few people think it's funny, but most don't. It's a joke. It's a joke that doesn't work if the government is trying to get people to get vaccinated."
33,15,The title of the AMA is misleading.
33,16,"The first book, I read, was a joke."
33,24,It's about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
33,30,"""I want to have the conversation with my professors today, about a person with a scar from a virus, that's a joke, but I have to think, I'm trying to explain this to you"""
39,33,">I think there should be a ""warning"" part or more."
48,33,There's no joke in the world.
49,33,CANNOTANSWER: Because I can not believe it's a joke. I'm convinced that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
51,33,I can't say for sure that any of those are jokes. I don't see any reason why I can't think of it as a joke. If it weren't for a joke it would have been hilarious.
53,33,I've been in this situation a few times:
72,33,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: It's a joke. They're trying to make it illegal. The government is trying to make it illegal."
73,33,Why would he get covid? Because he was a prick. He's not a dick. He's a racist. He doesn't think that's funny.
74,33,"It's a joke. It's an unintentional, unsupported joke. There's no way that it can prevent the spread of a virus. It can't even stop a virus from spreading."
93,33,The film has a lot going on in the movie.
99,33,"""I feel like you don't know the purpose of the title."""
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I read the AMA as an AMA and then read the post to see if the AMA was a jingoistic joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
33,7,I think that people are just making a joke. It's a joke that's a joke. But you know that's not something people do and you aren't a joke. The government is trying to make it illegal.
33,15,A lot of people have no idea what the AMA is about. They think it's funny.
33,16,I think a joke is more of a joke about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
33,24,Why isn't everyone in the AMA a snide joke?
33,30,"I can't even fathom the first one. It's a joke, it's funny, it's not a joke, it's not a joke."
39,33,"I don't know much about this, but I'm a big anti-fascist."
48,33,"It's a joke. It's an interesting thought. I'm a little fucking crazed by the notion that we could do anything, just make a bunch of jokes, and we can all take a good, humorous way out of it. I'm so happy we don't have to give up on fads and get back to being people."
49,33,It is a joke. Is that really the joke you need to be laughing at? Is that the joke about you being the joke and not the fact that people are not getting the joke?
51,33,Vaccines are not legal because they protect against all types of viruses.
53,33,"The article, ""I'm sorry, but I'm the one who actually figured out how to tell the truth. I'm the one who actually figured out how to tell the truth."

99,33,I'm going to make a big point about the clone in a clone. I'm not going to make a big point about the clone. It's a joke about it. A clone is just a joke because it's about a virus and they can wear it.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I'm getting tired of this AMA and a few people commenting on it.
33,7,I'm not sure I'm sure a doctor would not be surprised to be reading the AMA because there's a lot going on in it.
33,15,AIDS is a problem that if you get a vaccine you have to wear a mask to stop it.
33,16,"...but I think wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,24,The AMA is a joke.
33,30,I am very curious about what this is called.
39,33,"It's a joke. And it's not a joke, but it's a joke."
48,33,> I think it's funny that a prank exists. A prank has to be an attempt to inflict a death or even death on those who are not infected.
49,33,"Then, I think if I was a doctor I would be pretty resentful and angry about it, but I don't really care what people think of it."
51,33,"If they don't like the act of getting vaccinated, and not being told it's against the law, they have no right to make it illegal."

73,33,"This is an AMA, so I can only think of a few possible alternatives."
74,33,"As someone who has been in a similar situation, I would highly suggest that you consider calling this joke a joke. There are many aspects of humor to be found in the way of saying something like ""I like to tell you what I can tell you when I'm not sick. If I don't get sick again, I will get sick."""
93,33,This is something I want to post about in r/therealsanta.
99,33,"It sounds like a joke. But the santa in the movie is about a virus and it is a joke and a joke, and the clone in the clone is a joke. So what exactly is a joke?"
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,People want a joke. This is not a joke. It's a joke.
33,7,"I have not seen the movie before, but I do remember reading that it's not about the virus, and it's about a joke. I think if the movie isn't about the virus, the book is about it, and that's a joke."

39,33,"I don't think it's really a joke. I think it's a joke. But if they're just doing it as a joke, they should have a warning that people are being offended."
48,33,"They are about the government, but not the AMA. That's not about the government."
49,33,I've read all of these AMAs.
51,33,"I'm an AIDS survivor, and I think this is what's going on here. I don't know what you're talking about. This isn't just about vaccinations, it's about people wanting to help to keep others healthy."
53,33,A lot of the AMAs are just a bit sarcastic.
72,33,"""I don't believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV."""
73,33,That is why I wrote this.
74,33,Vaccination is an attempt to stop the spread of a virus. A mask is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are not what the government wants.

33,16,"I'm gonna say the AMA was the happiest, most serious AMA ever."
33,24,This isn't just a joke. The AMA is a joke. It isn't about the government or the government.
33,30,I read the whole thing. I am wondering what it's called?
39,33,It's a joke about the government trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
48,33,"That's a great joke, but isn't one that's being sarcastic."

If I'm sick I will do it with my mum. I mean I'm trying to get sick and I have to make up my mind that this is a joke and it's not a joke."
33,16,The AMA was a rip off of the book. AMA is about the government helping people get their own virus.

101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,AMA is about a government's AMA trying to help patients stop the spread of HIV.
33,7,"I mean, the title is incredibly misleading. I can’t think of any other joke that would be considered to be joke in the title of the book."
33,15,"""My mom was saying that if I am a doctor, I'm going to get vaccinated but I want to get a vaccine to stop the spread of AIDS."""
33,16,I'm trying to figure out what the real point of the AMA is.
33,24,"AMA is a joke, a joke about the government being trying to stop the spread of a virus. I'm surprised I've read this AMA too many times."
33,30,"I can't believe the AMA doesn't have this kind of stuff in it. I want to get out of my ad, to get in an AMA, to tell the truth and the joke in general."
39,33,AMA isn't about saving people. It's about the fact that the AMA isn't about saving people.
48,33,There's a difference between wearing a mask and a prank.
49,33,"he is telling the truth he needs to be more clear and make it clear he does not want to be the joke. it sucks for a lot of people, but it isn't a joke. people don't get to choose what they want to believe.

51,33,That's not the joke. It's a ripoff of the book.
53,33,This post is about how to be a virologist in the USA. I don't see any reason not to buy a mask.
72,33,IANAL. but this has something to do with the AMA containing the most controversial information on the subject.
73,33,So they're trying to get people sick? Why would they want to be sick?
74,33,"It's actually a joke to make fun of someone. It's not a joke. It's a joke to make fun of the doctor, they just don't want to believe the doctor has had enough or had more of it. Vaccination is part of a joke, it's a joke."
93,33,I have a question for you today: Are you going to have a movie that resembles a book?
99,33,This is so bad that you cant even read it.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"This is a bad joke that the author can't even say a word without pointing out, it sounds jingoistic and ridiculous. It isn't funny at all. And i would really hate to hear this title, but not to say the same thing if it was a joke about a jingoistic AMA about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. It has a lot of humor in it. I wouldn't mind hearing that title again if I had to"

33,16,"“Vaccination is a very dangerous thing. It's very much something that we have been working through that can only happen through public exposure, so I'm sure you don't want to hear it.”"
33,24,Why are you going to have a movie that resembles a book?
33,30,It seems like a ripoff of a joke.
39,33,The best part is that it's an extremely racist piece of information that is just 'a ripoff'.
48,33,I am going to go back to what the rest of your commenter said - but I am not saying this isn't a joke.
49,33,"It's a joke that's about the government, but a joke about the people who get vaccinated."
51,33,Vaccines aren't illegal because they protect against all types of viruses.
53,33,I'm afraid the joke is about the government and the government assassinating someone.
72,33,I think it is a joke that the government and the people on the front lines of the media are trying to make fun of people.
73,33,The headline is pretty funny. He needs a mask to stop AIDS. He's a dick. He doesn't want to go on a fake AMA. I think a big problem is that the AMA is being banned. The article is misleading.
74,33,Is it actually a joke?
93,33,"I'm trying to decide whether to use a different term for the two. The first one was ""Have you seen Miracles, and have you seen it?"""
99,33,"Having a mask and a helmet helps a lot, but it irritates me that most people don't know what the whole idea of a mask is - he's supposed to be wearing a mask, but he doesn't have a mask and doesn't look like a clone in the same costume as the clown he's supposed to be wearing. Apparently you don't know if it's a joke or not if it's about the clone in a clone"
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I think the joke is about the government trying to stop the spread of HIV and what it is about the government.
33,7,It's been 6 years. The AMA is a joke and they are attempting to make it illegal.
33,15,No one is going to get a vaccinated child unless he gets a vaccine. It's a joke.
33,16,I think it's interesting that the book was a joke.
33,24,I have read about the AMA that people have been watching for years. I have no idea why they wouldn't use it.
33,30,What is the best way to stop the spread of a virus? I'm sure some people do.
39,33,That's one of the few things that makes people feel bad for people who want to avoid the government. It's about protecting the people.
48,33,"I'm not an expert on pharma, I'm a proponent of a drogue. You could say that is a really good joke to get people to stop believing pranks like that. But that's not the case for a lot of people in the world."
49,33,I think they are both sexist.
51,33,I'm in Florida and I don't even know what it says.
53,33,"I'd like to add to this the AMA is called ""I don't wear a mask in public"""
72,33,I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.
73,33,The article does not say 'If you read the title you aren't going to follow it unless you follow the OP's directions.
74,33,CDC needs a mask. No. They don't have a mandate and a mandate to get vaccinated. They have to provide vaccines on a case by case basis and they need to get it out of hand if it's necessary to do it.
93,33,"""I like to think that this is a ripoff of the book."""
99,33,It's a joke because it is a joke and the title makes it sound like it's a joke and the title makes it sound like it's a joke because the title is so obvious.
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"I've never heard anyone say the joke is a joke. Just saying that, it's interesting to me."
33,7,I'd say that AMA is really great for being funny but it's just a little too sexist.
33,15,A little bit of the following are taken out of context:
33,16,A joke about the government is one of many AMAs. They are about preventing the spread of HIV. They are trying to put a lot of things on people who don't understand the topic.
33,24,Is it possible for us to be able to have one or more of the three of them?
33,30,"AMA. CANNOTANSWER, MD:"

I think this AMA is based on facts and facts and the reason AMA is written is that people think it's racist. AMAs are about the government, CDC, and the world's population. People who are vaccinated don't know what they're talking about. I think AMAs are about the AMA. The AMA isn't the joke."
48,33,"It's a joke. A joke that's meant to be funny. The AMA isn't about 'we do it for fun, but the whole point of a prank is to stop the spread of a virus.'"

51,33,A doctor that lied to me and lied to me is actually not allowed to wear a mask.
53,33,I'm sure it was written by the same person who wrote that article.
72,33,AIDS epidemics are just a joke about the government trying to stop AIDS. This is one of the few things I'd do if my country had AIDS.
73,33,"So this is not a joke, unless you follow the directions. Then I don't understand your point. Is it possible that the government is not able to make it illegal to wear a mask, which would be inappropriate."
74,33,I think people shouldn't be allowed to make jokes about what the government says or does when it makes a joke.
93,33,a movie about a guy who wears a mask and goes afoul of Santa. is a movie about a guy who wears a mask and goes afoul of Santa.
99,33,"If the title of this was a joke, it would be a joke."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I think people should be allowed to have one or more of the three AMAs:

It wasn't about the AMA, it was about the fact that she was a part of it, it was about a different disease. So the joke was about the government.

72,33,"You have a point. The government needs to do whatever they want with the CDC, and not just keep the AMA on. If you don't get an AMA on the subject, why do people go to a public hospital? Because that will not make them comfortable in the future."

33,2,I'm a huge fan of AMAs. But I don't understand the meaning behind them. I don't understand the meaning behind ''the joke''. It makes me so angry that it's too jingoistic. But I agree with this post. I think the point of an AMA should be to spread awareness of a topic that is not a joke.
33,7,>I don't understand that the author can't make a joke about what the AMA is about.

48,33,I can't believe AMAs are so bad. All of this is a joke. All of these are jokes. And AMAs are about the government assisting with the AIDS epidemic. AMA's are about the government assisting with the AIDS epidemic. It's about the government assisting with the AIDS epidemic.
