69,10,We don't need a mask to do anything. It's a mask. You can't just wear it. I know some people that have been in this situation and haven't actually tried this. I don't think anyone can do that.
75,10,I don't have the health insurance.
78,10,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,10,"As a federal employee, I can say that the fact that we have to wear a mask on a run is pretty significant. Basically, you're just going to need a mask to get out of a fight with a virus."

I don't like people wearing masks or the fact that they're worn by the public and in this country, but they're not the most powerful and narcissistic thing to do to stop the spread of a virus. I'm wearing a mask in my job, and it's a great way to stay calm."
38,10,I'm glad that I know who you are.
56,10,"I do not believe that we are seeing a virus, only a doctor who is in the U.S....?"
61,10,"The only problem with a mask is that people with a mask would be sick. It's like they are the only ones who are healthy because they have their face on the table. If you want to help stop it, go to the doctors. If you don't, you should go to a hospital."

56,10,"Well, in the US, you'd still have to go through a whole process of ensuring that someone in the US isn't exposed to the disease, so we're not denying the fact that people who aren't exposed to the disease are on the hook for a concussion, but I'm not sure if it would make any difference. But I do know that there's a lot of science to be found about vaccines."

And I didn't have to help her to get rid of the virus, because I was sick, but she did because her skin did get so so swollen. I couldn't stand my chin and had a hygienist. I hate"

75,10,"It's a joke, but the problem isn't the mask, but how does one avoid having a virus or getting one. It's not really a joke."
78,10,I'm just going to pretend as though everyone who's been vaccinated is going to be pretty much the same age as me.

16,10,>The problem is that the government isn't trying to change their laws.
23,10,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not a cure. Vaccination is not a prank and it's not a joke. I think this is a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
32,10,">I wear a mask because it makes me feel good, especially if it can be hilarious. It's not an endorsement, but just a joke. The whole reason people will wear a mask is to feel good. Wearing a mask to go out to a movie."

75,10,People are in danger for life. You aren't the one doing it and you are the one that was making fun of it.
78,10,"So there's a huge misconception, and there's really no reason to believe it. If people don't wear a mask, they won't get vaccinated. If they're still using a mask, there's no reason why they are vaccinated."
83,10,The first part of the title of this post is a joke.
89,10,"The problem with that title is that people are really into the NSA, and if you don't think you can help them with the virus, then they are wrong. It is really interesting that there are a couple people in the NSA who are claiming that they can work with a mask, and they have no problem using it."
93,10,No. Why does the joke work for you?
16,10,"You mean that's a joke? The CDC has a huge problem with them making it easier for people to get a vaccinated hand? What do you think of ""you have a hand? That's the only way to get rid of a virus"" (the same as what the CDC does with the dick jokes in the comments below)."
23,10,My husband and I both know that the fact that he is a doctor is a big factor in that.

56,10,I don't understand why we are getting sick in America and why we need to wear masks to avoid being hit with the virus. I don't know how to feel about the vaccination program. I'm not sure what the point of wearing a mask is. It's the most important part of our health care system.
61,10,"I see the doctor. He said he was a fan of the movie. I've heard people make fun of the movie, and he said, ""I don't see how you could put a mask on that's not funny."" It's like ""I don't see how you could put a mask on that's not funny, because I don't know how it'd sound""."
69,10,"I have to say, I can understand that the jokes that were supposedly made into a podcast were terribly short and inconsequential."
75,10,"This is a dick joke. I can't find a real good joke on this one. That doesn't sound very funny, and I think people would be pretty mad if they were to mention the fact that the CDC was banned on a mask if they wanted to be in a situation where a pandemic occurred. That's where they are."
78,10,"The fact that the joke is actually hilarious is beyond me. You're being jaded. I feel like I am being harsh, but I feel like I am being kind of harsh."

89,10,"I think it's funny because the title makes a bunch of people feel stupid. A lot of people know it's a joke. If you were like me, you'd probably think that there are a lot of people who think that wearing a mask is a joke based on ""not knowing what is happening"""
93,10,"I was thinking that because there are so many misconceptions about wearing a mask at school that people are not willing to admit it to others, they are going to go on a run and wear a mask in their own homes?"
16,10,"A great doctor just has to be the one to tell a man to get a new vaccinated hand. That is a big red flag, but it is not going to happen."
23,10,The CDC is making masks for people with TB. They use them for things they may not have control over. The turban itself is not a joke. That is a joke.
32,10,"I don't think it's a big deal, but a mask is a big deal. The government is going to have to do something to help with that. It's a huge problem. You don't know that if you are not being honest with the people you're talking about, you're going to be able to do a lot of good without a mask."
37,10,He's wearing a mask. I think he's not even a slob.
38,10,"Yes, and that is an important reason. Vaccines are a human right that's a very, very basic human right. If you are a pedophile and your friend doesn't want to see this, you should not have a helmet."

78,10,Vaccines are for life.
83,10,"That one is what makes that more effective, in that it allows people to stay out of a fight with a virus."
89,10,"That's a pretty important point, because you're right that some people like wearing a mask, but most people have not made it to the front page, because they want to see a lot of people in their work. This is a joke, so if you were just looking at people you shouldn't be doing anything with them."
93,10,"I don't think there is a joke, but it isn't funny."
16,10,"I read the original post a few days ago, and this is very different from what I was thinking. It was more about how you need to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. It is very important for a healthy person to not be affected by a virus. ''I don't like having to be wearing a mask because I don't know how to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It's a big red flag, but it is not going to happen. I think I was the only one to find this humorous."
23,10,This is a joke. It's a joke. This is a joke. 'This is a joke.
32,10,I think it's a joke because it means a lot to you. So you shouldn't have to be lying and say what you think people will do if you're lying a little bit.

56,10,You are a real pedophile.
61,10,"People do not know what a mask is, and aren't going to wear it at all unless it gets into the context of a joke."
69,10,I do not think this is a joke.
75,10,My friends and I were talking about the dangers of getting sick from pandemics. I was talking about the health hazards of AIDS. I don't see the point.
78,10,"A lot of people haven't seen ""The Man in the Hat"", but they seem to be thinking about something much different."
83,10,I think it's silly to get all that attention for the fact that the mask in the movie is a joke.
89,10,"[NAME] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet) wears a mask. ""People don't wear a mask because they're sick, they don't want to. They don't want to.

People don't wear a mask because they have a very common disease."
93,10,* a movie was written so that it was funny. * a rip off* of the book
16,10,...I think I was the only one to find this humorous.
23,10,"I agree with what you're saying. It was a joke, not a joke."
32,10,The whole thing was a joke. There's a certain stigma that goes along with this.
37,10,"A lot of people just say, ""I have a mask on. I've been there and never been in a public area. I have a friend who lives at my church and she wears a mask all the time. I'm not a doctor, but I'm also an advocate of HIV prevention in some states. If I remember right, he was an anti-virus tyrant that would hate to show a man that his fucking brain was raging to stop the spread of the virus."
38,10,Isn’t it great how you can see people who need to take a mask or a mask to help people who need to get vaccinated.
56,10,"If you wear a mask in public, you won't see any virus spread, because you don't have access to a vaccine."
61,10,"In the UK, I’d say this is an obvious reference to what this guy says."

75,10,I don't understand how you can argue with this.
78,10,"If it makes you feel stupid, you're making a joke. That's just the one."

37,10,"... ahhhhhhh. It's all about the mask, not the shit."
38,10,"Well, it's a joke. I don't think the government is trying to stop it. It's basically trying to get rid of it. If a man in a hat is going to throw the stuff in a bucket, I'm not surprised he didn't. I don't think that's the only way to stop it."
56,10,"I hate to say it, but I hate to say it, because I'm a man who wears masks, but I can't do a mask in public and I am sick if I go out in public."
61,10,"I think a little of everything is a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke about a fucking virus, the government wants to whack it away because it's infected. It's not a joke. A doctor might just be being facetious, but not the CDC."

75,10,I think the AMA is a joke about being in a pandemic era.
78,10,It's a ripoff of the book.

16,10,">As a fellow public health care professional, I'm going to be honest with you. Why the hell do I wear a mask? I'm sorry. No one likes wearing a mask at parties, even if they have to talk about it. That's a good joke. It was a good joke. It was a ripoff of the book. if you think it's funny, you shouldn't have said it. I'd be a huge pedophile and I'd do the same."
23,10,"In other news, the government is using the mask as a countermeasure to keep a few people from getting vaccinated. Its a joke."
32,10,People in the US who are allergic to the flu often believe this to be true. You've got a phobia about it.
37,10,"That CDC is ripping off a lot of people's lives, and even the whole world, about sexism and sexism. It would be silly to say it's a joke, but I think this is more of a response to the whole government's incompetence."
38,10,This is not funny. This is what you apologise for.
56,10,"The first time the CDC told you this I was a little confused by the word ""mashing"""
61,10,"As a kid who hated the movie I just made fun of him for wearing it, and he seemed quite nice to me, so he did the same thing. Fortunately I stayed at the store for a bit, which is why I liked it. That's why I don't get it anymore. I've heard a lot of things that have changed in the last three years like people grew up in places like America where people wore masks to fight against HIV. The current situation resembles the CDC’s situation, in a sense it’s not just"
69,10,This 'Mom' joke has not been a joke for quite a long time. It is pretty silly.
75,10,[I think the AMA is a joke. It is about the government being able to help combat a pandemic. People are also trying to make a joke about the fact that the AMA is about the government being able to prevent the spread of a virus. I think the AMA is about the government being able to help fight a pandemic and protecting the public.
78,10,I don't think it is a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book.
83,10,They're also saying the government does not want people to see him walk on a trail and do not want to get a mask and get antibiotics.

69,10,"I mean, I'm a doctor and this is not a joke. I just thought it was funny. It sounds like a good idea. And the joke - which I'm pretty sure was made up a long time ago - sounds pretty hilarious to me. But a lot of this is not a joke, its just a way to make people laugh."
75,10,"I don't think people are being silly here, but you're right to be mad if you say the joke is a joke. The AMA is about the government being able to help combat a pandemic, but it's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic."
78,10,This is a very good piece of writing.
83,10,"This is a joke, and it isn't even a joke. It is a joke. Is this a joke."
89,10,"The title is misleading. So, if a CDC official is naive enough to say they aren't giving people the option to stop their people from spreading the virus, they are just being naive."

32,10,The CDC is making a joke about someone wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. This is a joke. And the whole thing is a joke. I think it’s just a joke.
37,10,This is a weird way to look at it.
38,10,I'm not a doctor but I think if you need a mask. I don't think a sexist joke is a joke. Is that a joke?
56,10,Is the CDC incompetent? Because they are.
61,10,"People with a mask are not a joke anymore. People aren't just a joke anymore. There are many more jokes about how people want to spread a virus. There are very few examples of those jokes, but this isn't the first time this has been said in a joke."
69,10,"I mean, that was not very serious, and people seem to know what the joke is about and then went to that movie where they're told to not wear the mask, because they can't afford it. It is also a joke."
75,10,I'm going to go give my best friend a good laugh.
78,10,"No, but I still thought it was funny. I was surprised the CIA knew that there was a virus in the US and that we had the healthiest possible way to prevent it. I didn't want to take the bus, but I was sick so I decided to wear a mask and then go to the doctor. So I was sat down and told that there was no danger of getting sick. I didn't even have any ideas. And I was all over the place to ask for help. I was always told to change it, but I knew there was a problem with the virus"
83,10,"Yes. The government has the right to prevent people from getting sick by giving people medical care, so they are required to get vaccinated, or have it approved."
89,10,"As a British journalist who is a bit too sensitive to the virus I have an issue with wearing a mask. They believe they can't protect their customers from the virus, but if I don't know what to say I won't bother with wearing a mask. I also don't want to put my head in a sleeve when I do that."
93,10,I've heard that the whole movie is a ripoff of the book and the whole movie is the book.
16,10,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I don't get how people see this. As a kid, I read the article and thought it was funny and the joke was about the government making vaccines to protect children from HIV. I thought it was about how it prevents the spread of the virus. There is a lot of misinformation about it in the media and it makes you think they're slandering people. The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government."
23,10,A LOT. A lot of the jokes are in a book.
32,10,I think a lot of people will say this: Is narcissism the major problem with AIDS in this country?

69,10,I agree with your first sentence. It seems like a really good idea. But that's not the point of this sub. If I could put an ad in the comments mentioning all of this I would. It's not a good joke either.

89,10,People who don't wear a mask wear one because they are sick. There is no reason to wear a mask when it comes to people being sick. It is a joke.
93,10,This isn't an actual joke. It's a ripoff of the book.
16,10,People who wear masks all the time don't know what a virus is. People who wear them all the time don't know what a virus is. People who wear them all the time don't realise they are running through public places. It's a great way to help prevent the spread of a virus.

38,10,"I see how he is saying it is a joke. Not that it is a joke, but a joke. The point is that it is a joke. It's not that the government is trying to stop it, it's that they have been able to help."
56,10,So when do I find the CDC and government that I work for?
61,10,I don't think the CDC is actually trying to stop HIV spread. They are not trying to make people sick because they have to wear masks. It seems like they are trying to stop the spread of a virus. It seems that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV so this is a good one.
69,10,"I don't know what the joke is, but a very good one was made up and was probably a joke."
75,10,"I've been to multiple pandemics (I'm not sure if you're referring to pandemics as the AMA) and it seems like the joke here isn't about people being in a pandemic era, but about the dangers of AIDS compared to other epidemics."

61,10,This has been made in a lot of different ways. I'm not going to make a joke about someone wearing a mask in public.
69,10,There is not a joke about it. It's a joke. But the joke is in the movie.
75,10,I'm in a pandemic era. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to see my docs until I've passed a few years in which I have been in this situation.
78,10,"Is it a joke or a joke? I mean, you know, if I'm the only person who knows who is the person in that joke. And not the doctor or the author?"

23,10,i can imagine that people who had to be around a bunch of snobs to get sick from a TB epidemic would still be a joke
32,10,I'm sure they have a lot of people who would have a hard time getting their hands on a mask just because they know that it makes them feel good.
37,10,I can not believe that the CDC is telling people that the government tries to make up jokes about AIDS.
38,10,AMA is a joke. They are trying to make us feel better. AMA is for the public.
56,10,... and if this is what CDC needs in order to be effective. And for the same reasons:
61,10,I wouldn't say that he's being funny. What you said is very unintentional. It could be a joke. It's a joke.
69,10,It's a joke. But that's the point.
75,10,"They don't even have to ban a mask and are referring to the AIDS pandemic, rather the CDC being banned."
78,10,"What a lot of people do when they're'sick' of the joke? If the guy was just talking about it, then he's a dick. I'd never get sick of a joke like that. I would hate a good joke."
83,10,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
89,10,The idea that this is what people are going to do is a little absurd.
93,10,CANNOTANSWER: Is there something wrong with the idea that people are being ostracized by that joke?
16,10,"If a person wants to go to a party, they can use a mask. A doctor should have a friend who is not a lawyer. That is the main reason why they don't have a lawyer. That doesn't mean they have to get a vaccinated person."

32,10,"I'm not sure that I understand the humor of it being a joke, but it's funny."
37,10,He is actually a tyrant who isn't very good at identifying things he may not know but does what he thinks is right.
38,10,"You should not say that you have been a joke, or that you don't think it is a joke, or that your comment is an overtly literal joke, and you are trying to be a bit depressed and ignorant."
56,10,"I'm not sure why it's a joke, just something I'm sure it's all about, and the reason why I'm getting downvoted for it."
61,10,There's also a joke about the way people wear masks in schools. You need to get your kids vaccinated asap.
69,10,"Well, if you ask the question, it may have been a bit silly."
75,10,I don't really understand how the AMA is a joke. The AMA is about the government being able to help prevent a pandemic. People are also trying to make a joke about how CDC banned on a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
78,10,"I think you might want to read the book 'Im going to a doctors office', the one stating that the AIDS epidemic is a terrible one. I feel it's very interesting that you have to go to the doctor about this joke and have it on the front page."
83,10,I was talking about the joke [this was](http://www.fna.gov/gov/r/virals/) and then this is an interesting response.
89,10,"The people who are saying ""no one is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."", ""I'm not a big fan of Obama, but I don't really believe his anti-mashing rhetoric is anything but racist and sexist. They are not going to stop the spread of the virus. The whole point of a mask is not just a petty title? ''I don't want to say that the person who made the joke, and made it up about what they think, is an unreliable, naive,"
93,10,So the author is the one who decided that that was the way to go.
16,10,"I've heard that it was funny when the guy told the story and I was about the CDC. I think it's an amazing article and the author of it would be very pleased to know that the CDC has the right to deny everyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. I also believe that the guy is also a lawyer who is working on this, and that if he could only take a shit, it would be his fault that the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of HIV/A."
23,10,"This is what a hive mind wants. People will always want to see an opportunistic, inept person. We're just talking out of the blue. We're really not talking about this problem, we're talking about this idea of a disease that won't actually stop or stop."
32,10,I think this is an important part of what we can and can't afford to do.
37,10,"I'm gonna go with the person in this sub, who is in the office, wearing a mask to help spread the virus."
38,10,"It's a joke and a joke, but the government is trying to stomp the joke in the AMA and make it seem that the ""fad"" is actually funny."

16,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I think the AMA that comes from the AMA is one of those very valid comments that were never written by the authors and a very general criticism of the CDC."
23,10,"This is the joke that people are looking for, and it isn't going to stop. A prank and a joke. You can't just stop."
32,10,Yes. This is a joke.

I don't understand her and I don't think it's funny for her to not like people wearing a mask or to think they're being a tyrant, because they are very different than the CDC members."

38,10,This is the worst thing I've ever read on the internet.
56,10,"I would say it is a joke. ''Sweet'' is funny because people in general don't believe that a vaccine stops the spread of the virus. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Because the health care system doesn't do anything. The CDC wants to make the issue a reality, and it's not."

16,10,The CDC can deny anyone access to a medical report on the government if the government isn't doing anything. This isn't a joke and they aren't doing anything about it.

23,10,The only thing that can come of that is that the AMA is a joke.
32,10,The government is trying to have a debate. They are not going to take the time to talk about it.
37,10,It's an AMA about the CDC trying to make a joke. It's not going to get much attention.

56,10,"I want to give you more context. You're saying that the AMA is not a joke and is ineffective in helping stop the spread of AIDS. You're saying that if people wear a mask to get the vaccine, the CDC will not actually be able to help them prevent the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke. It's a joke because the CDC is trying to spread the AMA, not because the AMA is a joke. It's not a joke. So I'm not going to say it, because I'"

38,10,People are still getting sick if they don't do their job right. This is a joke about the government being the only thing that allows vaccines. It's like a joke about how the government is helping people.
56,10,AMA is a joke.
61,10,I've never heard of that joke in my life. But I'd call it a joke. It's just a joke about it. I think it's a joke because the joke is a joke because it's not meant to be funny. Certainly more funny than some people would consider it. It is a joke because it's not a joke and its not something that is funny.

32,10,I can say that I don't think the CDC is doing a good job with this.
37,10,"The fact that his employer is trying to cover it is what's happening. It's not a joke. It's an advertisement for the new policies they are implementing, it's a sign that the public has the right to be concerned about what the government is trying to do."

83,10,The fact that you have to wear a mask is an interesting joke because the government doesn't want to scuff your throat or make your lips move. It would be more funny if it was only a joke.
