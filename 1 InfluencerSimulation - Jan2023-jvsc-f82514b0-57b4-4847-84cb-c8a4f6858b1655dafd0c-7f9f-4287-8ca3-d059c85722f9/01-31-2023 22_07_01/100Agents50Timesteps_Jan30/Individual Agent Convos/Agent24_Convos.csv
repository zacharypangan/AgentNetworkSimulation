24,22,"I've noticed that while you are in Florida, you aren't wearing a mask. I believe that's the rule, which isn't actually a rule. I think it's more that the Government is making regulations to prevent spread of a virus."
25,24,The idea that everyone has the right to wear a mask is a great one. People with a valid reason aren't entitled to wear it.
33,24,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
37,24,"A man is not only dangerous to us, but also violent. That's a good way to look at it."
42,24,> I like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate
50,24,The way you think the government is going to go about opening up the economy is the way you think of this. The only way a government will do that is by creating an environment in which people would not be able to make friends and have friends.
54,24,> I love the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate

70,24,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
75,24,And I get to go with you.
82,24,I am so glad that the gov't has stepped up to help stop the spread of a virus.

24,16,That he wears a mask to protect his home. It helps his family to protect themselves from a pandemic.
24,22,There is no need for you to wear a mask. You wear it at least three times in a month. You need to wear yours more often.
25,24,It is the best thing to happen to anyone whose kids are being vaccinated if they aren't wearing a mask.
33,24,"You're an idiot, just not a virus, just not a virus. A virus doesn't spread anywhere near our bodies."
37,24,It's a good way to look at it.
42,24,This is the one that is wrong. They are a tool of the government and they can stop the spread of a virus.
50,24,"I mean you don't say statewide, but that's kinda dumb. It's not the government's idea. Unless they're willing to give you a mask, the government's idea is to have people go outside for a month, and a few people actually go to a hospital or have to wear a mask, so you can have a good time."
54,24,I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask
55,24,"You don't want to talk about this, but it is very likely something your employer does. In some states we've been told to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. That said, I believe there is a difference in the way this is viewed by some people. You're making a huge mistake in that you're talking about it."
70,24,"I had no idea that this was a CDC article. Is it a fake? I haven't heard of it or do I think that's a CDC article, but i think that is a fake"
75,24,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
82,24,Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That's pretty crazy! I don't get what they said at all. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks.
24,11,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
24,16,"I believe the link you linked was a CDC article, not the actual article."
24,22,I don't get the notion that it's a rule.
25,24,"If a man doesn't wear a mask a week before the last day of work, and that he's afraid, he's being called superspy."
33,24,I'm going to have to ask you about your comment.
37,24,"As a Canadian, I wear masks on my veb pigeon's birthday. I have a bit of a red flag - it is something we need to do more than just sit in my own bed and wait around for everyone to get up and move."
42,24,I was really nervous after that episode. I don't know how I was in the hospital the whole time I was driving in my car.
50,24,... a mask and a helmet to protect you from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.
54,24,"No, it's not. It's not even an excuse to not wear a mask."
55,24,"I would be happy to speak to him, he's a great artist. I hope you enjoy his work. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The government has an obligation to keep everyone safe – not the children and the government itself. I'm sure there's something there. I see no reason why I want to wear a mask."
70,24,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
75,24,I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
82,24,"You could try this on a kid that's probably not a doctor, and probably not a surgeon. There is no law that prevents the person from getting infected."
24,11,I am just a bit of a vaccinatarian in a slightly different field. I don't see what 'everyone' would want to wear a mask if they were not doing it.
24,16,"I am not sure what the whole point is of that post. I just think this is a funny way to say it. I mean if you say that this post is misleading I don't think the article was true, it's probably a lie, but the link is just a fake."
24,22,People are saying that we should stop the spread of a virus? I don't think so. I think we should have an idea - like a man letting his pigeon get sick and not sneezing.
25,24,"Wearing a mask is a great idea, but I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop a virus from spreading."
33,24,"> ""Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
37,24,It's not a red flag that you're trying to make it sound like he is. It's the whole thing.
42,24,>The last CDC study that looked at the health of Americans who don't wear masks is from 2005. The average person would wear a mask about 10 or less times in a week without any type of physical contact unless they had a serious medical condition. This is the one that is wrong.
50,24,You just said a lot of things here. I'm sure there's a lot of overlap in your post.
54,24,"Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination. It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."

70,24,"As it happens, people don't have to wear a mask and will not even know what to wear when they go in for the day."
75,24,I am not a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim. I am a pandemic victim.
82,24,The reason for wearing a mask is because you are going to have to make sure they aren't wearing anything else.
24,11,Then you're just a bit of a vaccarian in a slightly different field.
24,16,This is the kind of post that needs to be removed for good.
24,22,"The idea of using the government to keep the public safe is very, very very valid. The fact that the US government is doing this is the only explanation that it's possible."
25,24,"'The most important thing to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a mask because we have to get a full blown antibiotic, and there is no way to vaccinate everyone but I don't think the government really cares about that stuff and it's a scam."
33,24,"I don't really see the point of being a ""mom"" in that context, and I don't think you get it. I don't really care if it's a joke, but I'd be very happy with what he's saying. But I think you're right."
37,24,>I'm a very cautious person and I really don't understand why we're so scared.
42,24,It's also why they cut education funding. They could be wrong.
50,24,"It's a joke that the government's idea is to have people go outside for a month, and a few people actually go to a hospital or have to wear a mask, so they can have a good time. That's not a'mask mandate'. It's a mandate that the government has no control over. It's not legal, but a moral compass of the government."
54,24,I think you've reached the right place for some kind of humor.
55,24,I can't believe that there is a nasa article in the wiki or the podcast that states people wearing masks to prevent illness are supposed to use a mask to prevent virus spread.
70,24,A LOT of people vaccinate themselves. I believe the CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat the spread of the deadly virus.
75,24,"If you want to stay out of the house, vaccinate yourself before the next one 'If you want to go, I can help you.' If you want to stay out of your house, I can help you, but the next one won't."
82,24,Why is the government not supporting the fight against HIV?
24,11,>I don't really see what 'everyone' would want to wear a mask if they were not doing it.
24,16,That is not the end of the world.
24,22,It's a joke because they have no idea what a mask is. They think they are a scam.
25,24,I don't even think you understand why the government is promoting it.

37,24,I'm sure it could be one of the best he's been for quite some time. This is a blatant scam that only a handful of states can be responsible for.
42,24,"I like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate', 'This is the one that is wrong. They are a tool of the government and they can stop the spread of a virus."
50,24,I'm just gonna go and say that.
54,24,So the people that use a mask are not infected - they're faking it.
55,24,"So when I go to school with my friends, I wear a mask and they say, ""It's pretty common for people who are afraid of getting hit by a car to work in the USA to avoid getting sneezed or shaved."" I do a few things based on the facts."
70,24,It's a joke. The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time. I think it's pretty obvious the government will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus.
75,24,"I just thought a bit of ""I don't have health insurance,"" because I think I'm the only one."
82,24,I don't understand why you're getting down voted. This guy isn't even a politician. OP: I've seen this many times but never had the opportunity to say what a mask would do. I'm getting up voted because of the hive mind.
24,11,I do it as a joke. And I do it while we're at the party level. It is the best kind of joke.
24,16,">This is the kind of post that needs to be removed for good.', 'This is the kind of post that needs to be removed for good.'"
24,22,"It's probably a bit strange to say, but your comments are still blatant. This is a horrible joke."
25,24,It's just a joke. You don't need a mask to have a virus. There's nothing to be ashamed of in Texas.
33,24,"The problem is that people don't get the information about the problem they need to enlighten themselves, despite the lack of health information. I don't think this guy is funny, he is telling the truth. I don't know the answer, but it's not that funny."
37,24,"The article says that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'd think wearing a mask against the spread of a virus would be a good idea. It’s only been three months, but there’s a big difference between the time it takes to wear a mask, and when you’re in a situation where your skin isn’t healing properly. You’re wearing a mask to make the doctor’s job easier, but if the patient isn’t healing properly, that’s the point"
42,24,>Worshiping masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,24,The government is basically trying to create a new anti-virus vaccine.
54,24,"I am more of a drug user. There's not much to be had, other than some of these sexist jokes. I was going to say: Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination. It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."", ""I think you've reached the right place for some kind of humor."", ""The people that use a mask are not infected - they're faking it. It's the people who made a joke out of this."
55,24,"""If it is a joke, then what would you like to hear?"""
70,24,Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign.
75,24,The guy I met a couple of years ago was like this. He was talking about how much a virus should be thrown out and how the CDC needs to fuck people if it's not a big deal. He was really oblivious to the fact that the CDC would have to cut down the ban on people wearing masks.
82,24,I'd say they were probably going to take a lot of hits but you're not gonna have to do much to stop this.
24,11,"The worst part is that most people don't realize how stupid this is to start trying to get rid of a horrible, anti-virus shaming tactic. This is an example of a symptom of the US, and a common problem."
24,16,>The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government.
24,22,"It’s like a joke because the man’s face isn’t the only thing that can make someone sneeze. You don’t need a mask. A mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. The guy who made it said, “There’s nothing to be ashamed of in Texas. The problem is that people don’t get the information about the problem they need to enlighten themselves, despite the lack of health information. I don’t think this guy is funny, he is telling the truth. It’s just a joke"
25,24,"I'm a little skeptical of the actual facts, but I have an epiphany."
33,24,"So i figured the AMA would be a joke, i think we need to do something about it"
37,24,"Yes, that's really weird. There isn't any actual evidence, he was trying to make a joke based on the article and the article itself. He's not trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's more the fact that he is trying to make a joke based on the article that he is trying to make, rather than the fact that he is trying to tamper with the reality, and that he's trying to make a joke."
42,24,The government has to be working hard to prevent the spread of a virus.
50,24,The government is actually trying to create a new vaccine. Its the only thing that is funny.
54,24,"Ahhh, and that's why I think the mask mandate is so good."
55,24,The problem with that NSA-funded anti-virus campaign is that it is not going to prevent a virus infected people from living in the US and causing a severe case of HIV.
70,24,The CDC is taking the first step. But I'd still say they've been doing this for a long time. They just don't know how to prevent the spread of a virus.
75,24,"This is the right joke. I feel like the message is clear - just because I think that's a good joke doesn't mean it isn't a joke. I think it would be pretty funny if people did that, but it wouldn't be funny."
82,24,>Is there any way a doctor could be the symptom of a virus that is not a mask?
24,11,I think this guy is trying to make a joke about the problem that is already there. But you've gotta look it up and see how it goes.
24,16,A doctor can be the symptom of a virus unless a medical professional is in the hospital
24,22,"""It's like a joke because the man's face isn't the only thing that can make someone sneeze. You don't need a mask. A mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."

33,24,"Nope. It isn't a joke. It is just a joke, because it is funny."

55,24,I like to think that wearing a mask would be funny.
70,24,"A bit of humor is going on in this thread. This is the biggest deal if the government, health care, etc., wants to protect people."
75,24,"I am sorry, but it seems like they have been using the same jokes for years. And yes, it's a joke, I still like the CDC."
82,24,"The word ""fecal"" has been used in the past a number of ways. The NSA is doing a lot more to stop the spread of a virus."
24,11,>I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop a virus from spreading.
24,16,"This is what he said. There is a lot of shit he said to the public, including a whole lot of shit, but he's pretty much in the clear. He's a jerk."
24,22,The government is making regulations to prevent spread of a virus.
25,24,"i'm also skeptical of the actual facts, but I have an epiphany."
33,24,I don't think this is a joke. I think it's a joke. I think the entire AMA was a joke. It was a joke.
37,24,> He doesn't have to wear a mask. They don't have to have it on.
42,24,I like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won't enforce a statewide mask mandate.
50,24,"It's not a mask mandate. It's a mandate that the government has no control over. It's not legal, but a moral compass of the government."
54,24,"Vaccination is not a necessity in our country. And it's not required, because it isn't even required to protect people from HIV/AIDS."
55,24,"""As far as I'm concerned, there's very little evidence of anything positive happening in the public health care system."""
70,24,I know that the CDC's role in preventing the spread of the deadly virus is to put a stop to fecal illness and not prevent the spread of the vaccine itself. The article is a sarcastic joke.
75,24,"AIDS is not a joke, it's a threat. It's a threat. The government will not be able to use it."
82,24,"I think the NSA needs to change, as soon as possible."
24,11,We can't just stop the spread of an HIV/AIDS.
24,16,"Vaccination is not a necessity in our country. And it's not required, because it isn't even required to protect people from HIV/AIDS."
24,22,"The problem is that people don't get the information about the problem they need to enlighten themselves, despite the lack of health information. I think the entire AMA was a joke. I think the entire AMA was a joke. I think it's a horrible joke. I think it's just a joke."
25,24,"> I think it's a bit funny that the AMA is so controversial on here, because it's a really popular joke."
33,24,"So if you look at the article I just got from your AMA and realized that it was a joke, that makes sense. I mean, it was funny, because I was trying to help the people who have the virus."
37,24,"This is a good thing, because you get sick without a mask and there is a small chance the public will see it in your face."
42,24,"This whole topic just got a bit confusing, but I've got to start with an emoji."
50,24,"I believe the current ""Mask Mandate"" is a joke about the government trying to create a new anti-virus vaccine."
54,24,"It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."", ""I think you've reached the right place for some kind of humor."", ""The people who made a joke out of this."", ""Ahhh, and that's why I think the mask mandate is so good."""
55,24,It's kind of a weird word.
70,24,There's so much that's wrong with the joke. It's funny and it's not a joke.
75,24,A big part of being a victim is taking a stance about being a victim in the future.
82,24,"There's no real definition of ""Penguin"" in the CDC's definition of a ""smoker"", which isn't defined by CDC. I'd be surprised if this was just a joke."
24,11,I don't get it. The AMA was not funny. It was a joke.
24,16,"That's a good joke. It was a joke. It's a sarcastic way to say it. It's a joke. The problem is that people don't get the information about the problem they need to enlighten themselves, despite the lack of health information."
24,22,It's really interesting how the government is trying to fight this. It's really pretty cool to say the opposite. It's not really a joke.
25,24,"My parents were in the UK, so I don't recall ever hearing of this joke."
33,24,"You mean that when a doctor says ""I wear a mask to stop a virus, it's useless and I hate it.""?"
37,24,"It's like the whole concept that if you need a mask, your job is to protect yourself and your family. This is not going to change unless you work for the CDC, who does not know what to do."
42,24,"It's about your health. You can't just stop it, you can just stop doing it."
50,24,I've never heard a joke before.
54,24,"""Made in Texas"" policy."
55,24,"In my experience, people wear masks to prevent illnesses. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. They can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,24,I don't understand how the joke works in the context of the article. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day.
75,24,The AMA is about the government being able to fight the pandemics and protecting the public. It's about protecting the public.
82,24,It sounds like it is just about being a joke.
24,11,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.

24,22,It's a joke.
25,24,"I've always thought the government was a joke, but it's not."
33,24,There is a story in this thread about a man who is going to a run in the middle of the night saying that he is on a mask and he has an asthma attack and has no symptom.
37,24,I had to get up on my own to see if the CDC would go around wearing a mask in public while my brother was sick.
42,24,"I don't think a military man would have much interest in taking a face mask in the military. I mean, the general public would see him with a face mask. But it's not a problem because the person has a disease that requires them to go to work."
50,24,It's a prick and a whack asshole. You're being kind of jaded.
54,24,"I've seen a lot of the jokes on this subreddit. I know a lot of the jokes, and I don't know the actual ones. I have read it a couple times and it's very good. I'm just surprised that people think the memes aren't in line with the title."
55,24,I think we need to cut the mask. They can't prevent infections without cutting them. We haven't gotten it that's a joke.
70,24,This is one of the few times I've heard that joke before.
75,24,I think you guys should start thinking about a lot of different topics.
82,24,"OP. I'm not sure what a joke is about. The problem here is a combination of ""why is the NSA not supporting the fight against HIV?"" and ""Why is the NSA not supporting the fight against HIV?"""
24,11,What's your point about the government and how a joke could be hilarious?

82,24,AMA is supposed to be about how a doctor gets sick. And not just 'fecal viruses'. Vaccines are designed to prevent infection of the patient by preventing them from spreading in public.

I think he was referring to the joke in the AMA and not to the AMA itself."

54,24,"If a person 'gets a virus' or an HIV virus, they're going to need to get one - the virus is very common in all countries. If it's the public health system, then it's not going to be a big deal, because they don't want to be able to help. They're not willing to help."
55,24,"People who go to school with their friends say, ""I want to wear a mask to prevent illness."" The people who actually get sick get a virus, a phlegm mask and face spray and a mask. This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,24,"I mean, there's a big difference. I'm not saying the article is a joke. I'm saying that the article is just one of those things that I've heard in the past. 'This is the biggest deal if the government, health care, etc., wants to protect people.'"
75,24,I think the AMA is the joke. It was about promoting awareness and awareness of the pandemics.
