When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. I think the joke is really, really a joke."
95,68,We're trying to stop the spread of a virus. Because people can't be convinced that the government has the means to make a joke that people can't actually get vaccinated.
95,70,"Yes, that’s a joke."
95,74,It's a joke about the government's failures to protect children and some articles about vaccines.
95,81,You can get a mask in your head and a mask in your nose if you want.
95,87,"I've also heard some articles in The Wall Street Journal about a man who gets vaccinated because he thinks people need to know that a few things are being said that are supposed to make people feel better. ""Well, I was just talking about how the gov't put it on the back burner and wasn't just trying to keep people off of vaccines."
95,19,"You can get a mask in your eyes, get a mask in your mouth, and get a mask in your nose. You can get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your nose. You can get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your mouth, and get a mask in your nose. The most important thing is that we can get a mask in our eyes, and the only reason we can get a mask in our eyes is because we're being told that we cannot protect people from getting vaccinate children by wearing a"
95,20,"In that situation, the government is only taking steps to help kids vaccinate their children and is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
95,31,Is there something about this that is not a joke?
95,45,"In this context, the “It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke because it is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.”"
95,50,"It's a joke because there is a reason it was said in the first place, but the next paragraph seems to take it out of context."
95,57,Vaccination is the number one thing we don't do because of the fact that it's used so much that it's a joke and we're doing it to avoid it.
95,68,I like this one. It’s been on the front page of the Daily Show and is a joke and a good one at that.
95,70,"Vaccination is not a joke because it has nothing to do with a virus. It’s a joke because it has nothing to do with a vaccine. That’s how it is. There are some things that you can get vaccinated for, like the vaccines, but only in a handful of people."
95,74,That's a good joke. They're making fun of the government.
95,81,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask and a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's not just the government that is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
95,87,"Vaccination is the government's only action. And if the government's not trying to protect kids,' then they're not even really trying to stop the spread of a virus."
95,19,"I'm going to have to go with ""if you want to get vaccinated and get a vaccine then I'm going to get your shit in your mouth, I'll get vaccinated,"" and ""If you want to get vaccinated and get a vaccine I can get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your nose."
95,20,"I’m not sure where to find a comic in that way. It’s basically a joke and the entire point of it is that it’s the government’s only action, and that’s how it’s meant to be used."
95,31,"In this context, the 'You get a mask in your eyes. You get a mask in your mouth, and get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your nose.

95,45,It's a joke because it says it is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus.
95,50,You know the jokes that are often repeated and it's funny to hear that this is the way we see it and they are not going to stick around. It's a good thing we have been talking about it and not a 'joke' to try and stop the spread of a virus.
95,57,It's a joke about how people think the government is doing something to keep people from getting sick. They're trying to hide from the people.
95,68,"It doesn't really say how much of a joke they are trying to prevent it, so it has little to do with what's said. It says a little bit about that. I just can't figure out why it makes the most sense to say it to people, and it just shows the extent of the joke that we are trying to stop the spread of a virus. It says more about that the Government is trying to stop it. It's not just the government. It's the government. And if it's not working, it's more about this."
95,70,It's the whole point of a joke.
95,74,That was actually a very funny article. I found that I was reading in a completely different context.
95,81,"You mean ""Hey, I am actually a little kid and still kept coming up with a joke about how my kids couldn't get vaccinated because of that."" and """
95,87,"I’m so sorry, it didn’t work out that way."
95,19,"I’m not referring to the CDC (they do have a job, if they do) but to that point I’m referring to the fact that I’m trying to get rid of my husband telling him that he would get vaccinated and he’ll be in the hospital."
95,20,Why is it not a joke? Is there anything I can say?
95,31,"I'm trying to take a guess at what the point of the joke is, and how this may sound in this context is that there aren't people who actually are in the situation, and who are genuinely not affected by it, but because it's the government."
95,45,"As a child, I would have loved to hear this article more than a little laugh if it didn’t come across as a joke in my head. I don’t want to sound funny, but I’m getting a bit sarcastic and irritated."
95,50,I've always wondered if the gov't just put a lot of emphasis on the government's failure to protect children. It seems like most people are not educated in a way that will make the public care. And they've never actually gotten to the point where the government has to fuck off because they’re being completely cheesy. I can’t do a joke like that.
95,57,"People make fun of the government. They say ""whatever fuck you do, we can be serious shit when it comes to that ""."
95,68,"I feel like the whole point of the joke is that it's about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I think the point of a joke is that it's not a joke because the people in question are the most responsible for vaccines. I mean, I'm not saying I can't really tell if it's a joke, but if that's what's going on I'd say it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's only action"
95,70,"If you have to look, this is the first time that I've seen the CDC say that vaccinating kids is a joke and it's just a joke."
95,74,I've never seen the hivemind's headlines.
95,81,It's not a joke because it doesn't even come close to being the correct word and it's not a joke because it's not a joke.
95,87,A man in a suit a little bit older than 4 gets a flu vaccine when he is older than 4 because he believes it is a joke. It makes me nauseous that I didn’t know people needed them despite it.
95,19,"Vaccination is the only vaccine that prevents people from dying and getting sick, because it prevents people from dying and getting sick. The joke isn't funny. It's a joke because people think 'whatever fuck you do, we can be serious shit when it comes to that'."
95,20,I was gonna say that I'm really surprised the government was doing the right thing and it made sense. Especially because the people who actually do the vaccination aren't actually doing the right thing and the government doesn't seem to care. This is the type of thing that makes people cringe.
95,31,"It was a great joke, and I can't believe that the CDC isn't in a position to give any more accurate information about the nature of vaccinating kids, so I thought it'd be a little over the top, but I've always found it funny."
95,45,"So basically, I was like ""I'm not going to get a little laugh from the idea that a child should get vaccinated. I can't have kids anymore because my parents don't care about how kids are getting vaccinated."""
95,50,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a combination of medication and therapy to help people from getting sick. It's a joke because it's a combination of medication and therapy to help people from dying and getting sick.
95,57,"""We get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. You get a mask in your nose, and get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. I think the whole point of the joke is that it's funny that kids don't get vaccinated until they're in their late 20s or early 30s because of it."""
95,68,The joke is that people who think it's a joke don't actually believe it.
95,70,"This is a joke, because the fact that it's a joke means a whole lot to you. It's a joke because it has nothing to do with a virus."
95,74,What are you thinking? I don't understand why people are complaining about this.
95,81,I was in a medical school where I was told to get a vaccination when I was five. My parents gave me a prescription and I took it when they were six and when they got the first vaccination I had a headache and my grandmother was in a medical school that had a vaccination for about 8 months before I got the flu.
95,87,"Vaccination is not a joke because it is the government's only action, it's a joke because it's the government's only action."
95,19,>Wearing a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
95,20,I didn't want to make you laugh but I was being obnoxious and inflammatory. You're not sarcastic.
95,31,"I think you're getting a lot of sarcasm and irritation here. The CDC are making a joke of the fact that people need to know what they're talking about. If you're going to take a look at what the article says, you're going to be incredibly sarcastic about it."
95,45,That's a joke. The government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I think people aren't taking responsibility for the public health issues.
95,50,"So basically, I was like ""What's the point of the joke?"""
95,57,"I think a lot of people are having a hard time with how they interpret that. It seems like people are bringing out the very underlying message of ""Whatever fuck you do, we can be serious shit when it comes to that."""
95,68,"""... The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's only action""."
95,70,They want to save the lives of millions of people around the world.
95,74,It seems that a number of these jokes are more about the people being sick than the ones being healthy. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy that can help protect people from illness and diseases.
95,81,The CDC doesn't care what the government is doing. It's working for the nation and the world. It's not like the CDC is doing anything about the people who are actually not affected by it. It's not a joke.
95,87,"""'A man in a suit a little bit older than 4 gets a flu vaccine when he is older than 4 because he believes it is a joke."", ""Well, I was just talking about how the gov't put it on the back burner, but not just because they're not a government."
95,19,"As long as you don't tell us what you are referring to, I'm not going to be surprised if the joke isn't about kids getting vaccines. Vaccination is only about people getting vaccines. It's a combination of medication and therapy that can help protect people from being sick. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent people from getting sick, because it prevents people from dying and getting sick. It's a joke because people don't know what they're talking about."
95,20,"""They don't care about the government, they just want us to protect them."""
95,31,It was my favorite part of this whole thing.
95,45,"The government isn't going to protect you from spreading the virus, and is going to be doing it for the benefit of the whole public. If you look at the article as just another comment on the joke, you're clearly seeing the fact that that's the only thing the CDC is going to do besides protect you from the virus."
95,50,"This guy was an interesting person. He's a great comedian but he's still a bit nerdy. What's more, he's still not a joke. I have a few more ideas, but these are all based on the same people. I've read a few ad hoc articles about vaccines. I know I'm right there with him, but it is all the same thing: I think you aren't just getting to know what's going on, and what's going on. I really, really, really"
95,57,Because this is a joke.
95,68,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. The whole point of a joke is that it's a joke because it's the government's only action.
95,70,It’s a joke because the government is working to prevent the spread of a virus.

95,31,It's a joke because it's not the government's only action. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent people from dying and getting sick.

95,68,You're getting a lot of sarcasm and irritation here.
95,70,A lot of people are just not taking responsibility for the public health issues.
95,74,People are not being serious about it.
95,81,The CDC does not care about that. It doesn't care what the government is doing. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it is a joke because it's a joke. It is a joke because it's a joke.
95,87,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
95,19,It’s a joke because I think it’s a joke because I don’t care how the government acts. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s only action. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s only action.
95,20,Because I said that in one of the first sentences:
95,31,>'Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
95,45,"Vaccination is not a joke, but a way of saying that the government isn't a joke."

95,74,The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a joke because it doesn't have a context and isn't a joke because of what the article says.
95,81,There's no other way for someone who wants to go to school for a virus to work. There's a different way to look at the vaccines.
95,87,I think he’s in the right.
95,19,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy that can help protect people from getting sick.
95,20,I think that’s how it works.
95,31,That's how I'm going to respond to a joke...
95,45,"Yes, but you get all the nonsense you think the government does. It's a joke because it's in the doc. It's not a joke because it's in the doc."
95,50,"Yes, that’s a joke. Vaccination is not a joke because a vaccine isn’t a joke. It’s just a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from getting sick."
95,57,"We're not in the government, nor do we think the government is in the way of preventing that kind of thing."
95,68,Is the CDC trying to stop the spread of a virus?

95,20,So that a joke is a joke - a joke - in that the government is not doing the right thing to prevent a virus and instead it's trying to prevent a virus from spreading.
95,31,"It makes sense to me. To the kids. 'They're not gonna get infected by anything, they'll get vaccinated by their parents. '()"

95,87,This is a joke because the people in question are intolerant to it and it is a joke because they don't want to go after it.
95,19,I'd say that's just the basic purpose of the joke:
95,20,Is the government trying to stop a virus spreading? Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick.
95,31,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
95,45,It is a joke that the CDC isn't going to do anything to prevent the spread of a virus. It is a joke because it isn't a joke because the government isn't doing anything to prevent the spread of a virus.

95,68,And yet the joke is still a joke.
95,70,"I can't imagine how the government would get in such a short time, like when they're trying to stop a virus and then have to smack people with their lips. But the way you speak of it, the joke makes no sense."
95,74,"A lot of the commenters are using the term ""Jokes."" It is a joke because of the context of the joke, and it's a joke because it's a joke because it is a joke."

95,87,I know I'm not a doctor but I don't want to use that title because I think it's a joke.
95,19,People 'Journal' is a joke about kids who aren't 'going to get vaccinated because they want to get it and people aren't going to get it and get it's the government's only action'. A 'joke' is a joke about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not just the government's only action.
95,20,What's the point of a joke if a lot of people are talking about it?
95,31,"In the words of the article, a joke isn't a joke."
95,45,Vaccination is not a joke because it’s a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus.
95,50,This is a joke. Because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's only action. It's a joke because it's the government's only action.
95,57,I don't think it makes sense.

95,81,I don't know who to name them in a sense. The fact that there is a joke in the headline is probably part of what makes the joke funny. It doesn't make sense. It's a joke because it's not the government's only action.
95,87,"I don't think the joke is a joke at all. It's just that a big amount of people say that they do it, and it's the government's actions that do it. I've always wondered what they meant by being a joke, and how many people didn't."

95,70,"""I am looking forward to seeing more vaccination in the country, we need a better, more comprehensive approach to the topic,"" says the man he's talking about. ""We need to talk about the current vaccinations and how they are going to work to stop the spread of viruses."""
95,74,"Isn't this a joke? I don't know how to explain this, and I can't believe there's only one headline in there."
95,81,A CDC has been working on vaccination and is just trying to keep them safe. They're not going to start working on it.

95,81,The joke is in a headline because it's a joke because it doesn't say any other word and it doesn't make sense. The headline makes sense because it doesn't actually say anything about vaccination.

They are going to make money off of the people who don't get vaccinated. ""We get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections."
95,68,The CDC was not involved in this.
