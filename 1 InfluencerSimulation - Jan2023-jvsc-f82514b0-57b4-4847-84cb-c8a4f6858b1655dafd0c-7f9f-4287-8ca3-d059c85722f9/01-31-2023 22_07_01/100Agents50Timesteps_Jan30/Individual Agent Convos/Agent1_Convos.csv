101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,I'm sorry mark 
14,1,>We developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again

26,1,wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
38,1,I think I am a little embarrassed by all the media and media outlets on here..
52,1,I know. We've got a a statewide mask mandate... I just don't want to be put in a mask.
54,1,Are you familiar with the concept of wearing a mask and keeping distance?
56,1,So...what are you using to say the same things? Do you know where this is going?
58,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,1,"We have to vaccinate children and not just keep them afloat, a mask will not stop it. But it won't help us."
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"So I'm assuming you're on the Internet? Because I know people in my own family that wear masks, and are the same kind of person whose only job is to keep them safe."
14,1,You're being a dick. There's no going back.
21,1,You know the virus has been spreading.
26,1,I love the song et al but it is my favorite song Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,1,If I remember right it's because a guy is wearing a mask when he's sick and wants to wear it if it is on.
52,1,The reason I haven't tried to wear a mask is because it's a good thing that we can be so nice to people.
54,1,"I'm not familiar with the concept. I just don't want to go and get a mask. I don't want to go on my vacation in Florida to go run or anything like that. But, if you don't go to the movies with me, or have a picnic with me, I don't want to go on the road. I want to go out and have a good time, and then go home and get some fresh air before I go. I want to go to the movies so I don't have to wear a mask, and to keep the face off"
56,1,"If a doctor has a vaccine to help a sick person, he needs to see the doctor. I've never had a bad experience with a sick person, but that's how it goes - in a lot of cases."
58,1,i was just saying that. you could try a helmet on your dog if it would prevent a virus from spreading in his or her area.
72,1,"I'm glad you got to know me. A person who wears a mask during a pandemic can be really, really uncomfortable if they're not in public."
74,1,"A lot of policing is carried out in places like Florida, Florida, and Mississippi involving kids. We need to be prepared to run on peoples hands, if I are to get sick, I need to yell at people and take them to a hospital and the doc will see that I must be a bad person or else he may not be there. We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,So you are saying you're not interested in knowing about the vaccination? What's the issue with this?
14,1,"A statewide mandate is a fucking thing. The problem is the country....and we aren't going to go to a fucking doctor. A lot of people will have to do what they want, and it will be much cheaper than a public health emergency. I would wear a mask to stop a virus and still avoid all contact."
21,1,I'd love to try wearing a mask that stops the spread of the virus. I'd love to try wearing a mask that stops the spread of the virus.
26,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Hr sent out an email saying those of us who s fully vaxxed w proof can go maskless again in the office yea i m good i m still wearing my mask open for public play saturdays and sundays pm pm practicing social distancing remember to wear your face mask playpaintball publicplay socialdistancing familytime paintball
38,1,"I don't see how it's a good thing that you've never been infected with a virus. It's a scary virus, and you can't really make a deal out of it. I know that if you get infected, you need a hospital scarves to help you avoid it."
52,1,"I don't know why you are so enraged but I think that's a good thing because you can be nice to people. Using the screamer in the computer is a big enough problem to be solved in one hand but in the other hand, the virus is so small that there's not much to see in the world (and I don't know how to do that) but it would probably help with less panic and stress and a better way to deal with an infection that would have happened if they didn't have to wear it."
54,1,What do you think about the CDC?
56,1,if you want to hear a doctor say that someone who didn't go to an area to be vaccinated could possibly get a concussion.
58,1,"I've also heard about this, but I thought it was a fun way to go with the tv show."
72,1,It's funny because I'm not a fan of wearing masks in public.
74,1,"As someone who has got a bit of colitis and a little anxiety, I feel like a very hard button for you to understand why you don't get a vaccine for a covi virus, even if it's just a temporary scar."
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"I don't know if you know what the joke is. I was a federal agent for a couple of years. This was only a couple of years back and I was still in a mask. I know a lot of people that wear masks. In addition to blaming the hr for the masks, the hr has been suing the staff. This is just a slap on the wrist for doing nothing."
14,1,"I don't know much about how we do things, but I don't think it's the same as if the person is vaccinated or not. It's more like someone is not supposed to know where to get the shit out. It's a bit like what some people are talking about and not really a shit person who is not going to get the shit out."
21,1,Vaccines do not contain a virus.
26,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,1,What is the'spy' label?
52,1,"I'm in an emergency room. I go to the dentist and go to my nurse. I don't know what to do, but the doctor is supposing that my doctor is on my side and that I was wearing my mask for fear of getting infected."
54,1,"I didn't want to post here, so I went over to find out more about the CDC, but this guy was pretty funny. Definitely the best ad for the CDC, I think."
56,1,">Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. if you want to hear a doctor say that someone who didn't go to an area to be vaccinated could possibly get a concussion. I do not believe that we are seeing a virus, only a doctor who is in the U.S....?... and then he says I think that"
58,1,"Isn't the phrase ""The CDC needs to address this?"" that you've read?"
72,1,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,1,"> As someone who has got a bit of colitis and a little anxiety, I feel like a very hard button for you to understand why you don't get a vaccine for a covi virus, even if it's just a temporary scar."

9,1,"> I'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."
14,1,Wearing a mask and having a hood around you would probably have to be a very common occurrence among those living with HIV/AIDS in Texas. Its a very common thing to do at the hospital as it will make people feel better but in reality it is not a real problem.
21,1,"I think that the government would be more concerned with preventing the spread of AIDS, and they would probably make less of a profit from it."
26,1,It's like a mask because people feel they are in a bind.
38,1,"The term spy's ""sectionary label."""
52,1,>I haven't tried to wear a mask in the middle of a run? It's like they just aren't trying to help in case you're sick.
54,1,"The CDC is in the news a couple of years ago. If someone has a virus, the CDC is not going to let it spread to them. The CDC is trying to do it to discourage those who have a virus."
56,1,"The US has a lot of anti-viral drugs as well as some pretty serious diseases, like AIDS and the like."
58,1,"In all seriousness, I'm referring to the fact that people are using the term ""Mask"" to refer to what the government has already endorsed to protect the public. They should be aware that there are things that need to be done and what is necessary to stop the spread of a virus."
72,1,"I am going to take the words 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' from someone who is in the same room as you. 'Well, I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable. The reason why you're getting sick from a pandemic is because people who don't need it don't think they can stop the spread of the virus."

9,1,">I'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."
14,1,"AIDS is a serious disease and it's a serious threat to people, if you don't want to be in the ER. It is also a big problem because there is a chance that you get to stay sick to a certain degree for an extended period of time because you are a hospital patient. I believe that a statewide mandate is a sexist joke and a sexist joke is a joke."
21,1,"It's interesting that the government is not so much concerned with preventing the spread of AIDS, as it is with preventing the spread of HIV. If you had a virus, you'd have to wear a mask for your face and have someone tell you to wear it on the spot. It's not a joke, but a joke."

52,1,"This is a joke. It's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny."
54,1,> I am not familiar with the concept of wearing a mask and keeping distance?
56,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I am not a government official."
58,1,"That's an incredibly stupid question. I just want to say that my post has been on a different level than mine. I want to help people, but I also want to let people know that you're having difficulty with this."
72,1,There are a few ways that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal.
74,1,"I agree that a mask has nothing to do with the virus. But as a general rule it's also a ccd or a hcd. If you're going to be vaccinated you don't need a mask, it's not a good idea. If you are having an axoma or a tv and need to be vaccinated then you have the right to wear a mask and try to prevent it. Unless you have some axoma, it's not a good"
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,As I recall: I've never been in a mask. The only time I've ever had any issues is when I was working in a factory and I was being vaccinated.
14,1,"I'd wear a mask, even if you haven't seen it. You know how people say that if you were infected with HIV, that it would mean you're gonna get AIDS."
21,1,"I think this is part of the reason we use the word ""free"" in this subreddit."
26,1,"I'm not sure what to say about this. I think we are all aware of the dangers of it, and I'm sure you're gonna have a hard time judging, as if people's attitudes towards it aren't on the table."
38,1,I have no sympathy for the pedophile. You're not a pedophile?
52,1,/r/reddit_repair
54,1,"This makes you think the government is making ridiculous accusations about using the term ""a mask"" to combat HIV in a joke."
56,1,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""I'm not a doctor, but I am not a government official."""
58,1,"If I had a mask and I had the santa and the mask wouldn't be able to stop a virus. I'd still be sick, but with an IV of THC I'd be unable to prevent it."
72,1,A lot of people here are under the impression that the CDC is trying to make the vaccination law illegal. It's more than just a joke.
74,1,It's a joke.
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"My favorite santa is when I'm working in a factory and my mother is on medication. She wears a mask and we're in my company and they're very good. The NSA can't be a bit of a dick, but I think the whole ""I genuinely enjoyed seeing the joke that they were trying to help me"" thing popped into my head when I was there."
14,1,"It seems like the NSA is not trying to get something for it, but is more concerned with the safety of the vaccines and its use for being an innocent joke, like I've said before."
21,1,There is no such thing as a 'hobby' that is actually a joke.
26,1,I think this is the best joke in the history of our species. It's interesting that so many different people on the earth disagree with the exact same ideas we have:
38,1,CANNOTANSWER TITLE
52,1,"If I had a mask, I would probably be a bit more concerned if they wouldn't have done the necessary research. I'm not saying that the CDC is a joke he can't be real, but what's wrong with that he doesn't understand?"
54,1,"I have read the CDC's medical history a little while ago about that issue and it does seem like there are plenty of people that have gotten involved with it, so it's easy to find a source."
56,1,"So in other news, I've heard that Texans who wear a mask can get a concussion. They think they have a good idea, or at least an idea that is possible."
58,1,Vaccines are for life.
72,1,"The problem isn't the mask, it's the disease. It's the government. It's something you can do to yourself or someone in your immediate family. Is this something that you can't afford to cover for yourself and your kids, or you need to get insurance because they won't be able to afford to take care of yourself. The reason it's so important is because the public wants to have access to something that will allow them to get to the doctor. It makes them a bad choice."
74,1,This is a bit silly. I'm just saying that it's a joke.
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"Vaccines are not a common practice. Vaccines have never been known to stop the spread of a virus. They do not prevent rape. They don't prevent ebola, but they are not required for the vaccines to stop the spread of a virus."
14,1,So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves. I am not saying that you are not being silly.
21,1,It's a prank. Vaccination is a joke. The only prank I've ever heard was on a Facebook group called 'Facebook and People's Hospital'. They were actually able to cover a large percentage of the problem with a mask.
26,1,"[(http://www.twitter.com/u/dl4t/comments/www-i-can_t_read-the-ama/moo_abc_i_can_not_read-the-ama/o_i_can_not_read-ama_)', ""The jokes are to keep people away from getting infected. They're not to get away with it if they twitch it. You're a fucking joke."
38,1,"In the US, the government has the right to deny people the opportunity to have a medical report on the government."
52,1,I don't think the CDC is a joke about a pandemic. The article claims that if people were to get sick from a virus in public they are safe enough to get a vaccination and use the screamer on a computer.
54,1,"He's very intelligent, and he's made a good joke on it. He's not trying to change the topic, it's just that people need to think they can keep the CDC out of the government's head. Despite it's shortcomings, the message is the one that isn't funny, and the one that isn't hilarious."
56,1,"Vaccines are not a gimmick, and they are meant to help TB patients get a little safer."
58,1,The answer to the question is that it's a health issue. The government needs to go after this health issue in a more constructive and honest manner.
72,1,"Vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren’t required. They are not legal."
74,1,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They are not what the government wants. There is not that much of an insurance coverage in many countries. They are also a bunch of private insurers that carry out the entire travel insurance and prevent and take care of the people vaccinated.
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,It’s really the only way I can remember saying this.
14,1,[A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You are being silly. You don't believe in the masked system. You believe in the masked system. So basically I’m saying this: the government should be taking care of everyone else’s health while they’re working. That way they can protect themselves. I am not saying that you are not being silly. He didn’t say he was being silly. You don’t believe in the masked system. So basically I’m saying this:
21,1,Vaccines are a ripoff. Vaccines are a ripoff.
26,1,As a person with a venomous disorder - I do not think vaccinating someone in public is a good thing. You are not the narcissist or doctor. But I would be very sorry for you if you knew it would happen. It's a terrible idea and a shame.
38,1,"Well, it's a joke. It's just that people use a lot of words in their post to yell at the government."
52,1,I think the article makes it look like a joke but what they say is actually a joke because it has nothing to do with preventing the spread of a virus
54,1,"Vaccines are a necessity. A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A doctor is going to need an expert and will need to work on an anti-vaccination system, because this would cause more issues than it does to a person. There are a lot of people in the world that aren't immune to it. It's the only way to get the NSA to stop the spread of HIV. It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."
56,1,That's a really bad line to start with.
58,1,"My favorite quote is ""That's a joke. I think it's more of a joke than it is a joke. Vaccines are a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus."
72,1,Vaccines aren’t required in most places. They aren’t required. They aren’t legal.
74,1,The joke isn't a joke. The joke is that people don't understand that a mask does not help prevent AIDS.
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,Vaccines are not required to stop the spread of a virus.
14,1,statewide mandate is a joke and a sexist joke is a joke.
21,1,Is there some point in the article where the government is trying to help stop the spread of AIDS?
26,1,"It's funny how the government does not go out of their way to prevent spread of a virus. People wear masks in public to prevent people from getting infected. The joke is really, really sexist."
38,1,The joke is that people are not being fair about the dangers of the government because they believe the government is a threat to public health.
52,1,You can have a joke by choosing to have people go through a CDC patch and then it goes over their heads.
54,1,"In your original article you also mention that the idea of a mask is that people need to be protected from a variety of ailments. For example, people who have been through it, or whose father got vaccinated or both, can wear their masks. For example, they can wear their masks in the summer or winter because it means they're better protected in the winter. Is it okay for them to wear a mask when someone's sick? Is it okay for them to wear a mask when they are out of the summer?"
56,1,Isn't it funny if your husband has a problem with it?
58,1,"Vaccines are for life.', ""If I had a mask and I had the santa and the mask wouldn't be able to stop a virus. I'd still be sick, but with an IV of THC I'd be unable to prevent it."""
72,1,"That's actually a pretty good excuse to have a new hat, and if you wear a hat you should also go go to the doctor if you're sick, so you have the right to be afraid of the virus. I can see where you are coming from in the context of the whole situation."
74,1,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They are not what the government wants. There is not that much of an insurance coverage in many countries. They are also a bunch of private insurers that carry out the entire travel insurance and prevent and take care of the people vaccinated.
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,They also did the AMA to tell us they don't want them to be illegal. So they're saying that they need a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
14,1,I'm a doctor who has had to deal with a lot of different diseases a few times over the years. It's very obvious to me that they have to use a different mechanism.
21,1,I think it's funny to think people would consider'mama a joke' to be a ripoff of a joke. It's the same thing as putting a santa in a mask. They should have a hoodie and a hat.
26,1,"What's the joke that means? ""I'm not going to talk about it because I'm not the narcissist or doctor."""
38,1,"I'm sorry but the joke is a joke that is a joke because people are telling shit and it's a joke. You just made me think that a man in a hat would have gotten a doctor in the face and a sicker person would throw their hat in the bucket and a person would throw it in a bucket, and then you would have got to go and find out who the doctor was and have a doctor who will try to take it down."
52,1,"Is this the first time the government has made a joke about the CDC? I know it's true. It's really not. I'm not sure if I'm a very good person or not, but I'm pretty sure this was the first joke and it's not a joke."
54,1,I don't think the mask mandate is a joke.
56,1,I'm a doctor. I am a lawyer. I don't care for how people look but I care for how people look. I'm not a doctor.
58,1,I'm going to throw out that the CDC was actually going to stop the spread of a virus in the CDC because the vaccine is not good enough.
72,1,"I would just have a hat on, just to have a hat on if i had to pick up some vaccines. That would be the best thing for me."
74,1,"What's more of a joke, is that they're being silly — the point is to make the joke — that we shouldn't be in the wrong for something like a colitis virus."
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"""I'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."""
14,1,The joke says it's a joke about the federal government incompetence.
21,1,"Vaccines are a joke. If the CDC doesn't enforce it, the AMA is a joke."
26,1,"I just realized this was all a joke, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry i couldn't explain it, but I'm happy to say it's not funny."
38,1,Vaccines are illegal because they help prevent the spread of the disease.
52,1,"The story isn't that great, it's that you're on a mission. You don't need a mask. You don't need a mask."
54,1,"In the end, what a joke."
56,1,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
58,1,"The ""Mask"" thing was a joke. The CDC is supposed to do all the things needed to prevent the spread of a virus."
72,1,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it makes sense to say ""you don't like a mask to stop a virus."" The joke is that the CDC is telling people to wear a mask because it's funny."
74,1,"No. I was not going to make a joke, but I said I felt like it was a joke. I'm sure some people get it but don't know if they get it. I mean a lot of people have been through this."
101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,So they want to prevent the spread of the disease?
14,1,"It's like saying, ""I'm a doctor who has had to deal with a lot of different diseases a few times over the years. It's very obvious to me that they have to use a different mechanism."""
21,1,That's not funny. That's not a joke.
26,1,Is the joke a joke?
38,1,The US government has the right to deny people the opportunity to have a medical report on the government.
52,1,Is this the first time the CDC has made a joke about the CDC? I know it's true. It's really not.
54,1,A lot of people on here have already said:
56,1,"I'm not sure why people would think that if I'm not a lawyer, I shouldn't wear a mask."
58,1,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
72,1,"The jokes made about people wearing hats during pandemics are ridiculous and a bit disrespectful. I think it makes sense to say ""I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable."""

101,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,1,"I was the one at the AMA about vaccines, it's not really a joke. It seems a lot of people are still laughing and not making sense and people are being shit about them."

14,1,What does the AMA actually say about the AMA?
21,1,The AMA's about preventing AIDS and 'protecting the government from the spread of it'.
26,1,Vaccine Advocacy is not a joke. The government isn't what the government wants.
38,1,"It's funny as fuck. It's funny because when you're trying to tell jokes that aren't really good, you're trying to tell the jokes that are bad. If you think this is a joke that you don't believe, you're just a little fucking sad about, and you don't think that's a joke, then the joke isn't funny. It's a joke, a joke, a joke."
52,1,"It's a joke about the government, a joke about a medical treatment that is supposed to help prevent spread of HIV/AIDS."
54,1,I'm very surprised about this.
56,1,"I'm a lawyer who works in the public health system. I've a couple of friends that have gotten sick from smoking weed because they feel like they're immune to a variety of medical conditions. They're going to ask me to vaccinate them because if I did, they'd not even want to, and would have a problem. They'd probably have a problem with their husband ignoring what they said and the fact that they have been making it sound like they're being vaccinated."
58,1,This is what people say in the AMA.
72,1,"I think if you don't want to be on the front lines of the military then get on the back burner. People are getting the impression that it's a joke, but you need to know how to phrase that."
74,1,Vaccines are not for everyone unless a person is infected.

9,1,>The AMA isn’t a joke.
14,1,"The AMA isn't about the government, but about the government's own incompetence and stupidity. The AMA is about a joke. The AMA is about how the government is trying to change the way things go. It's not a joke. Rather, it's a joke about the government. 'Why do people talk about their health to me '"
21,1,So what did the author say about the AMA and the AMA?

38,1,I have some very similar jokes:
52,1,It's a joke about the government trying to create an AMA about the CDC
54,1,"What is the story of the AMA? I don't see that part of it being a joke at all. I just see what it is, but I do think it is not a joke at all."
56,1,I don't understand how people are calling this a joke. You just can't be certain you don't like it when it's being made up.
58,1,""" I'm not going to lie, it's like you're saying people are being intolerant about a joke when you say a joke is a joke. They are not going to go after something because it's a joke."""
