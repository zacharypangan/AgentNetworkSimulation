8,6,The idea of the government actually trying to do things to protect others is a bit twisted.
11,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,6,"This is a real concern, not a law. I don t think it's too much to ask for your advice, but it is important to understand the importance of your role in preventing this."
38,6,>This month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask this month
39,6,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,6,"My raging ctl followers haven't said ""thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out."""
47,6,> I respect the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate
52,6,"...and to go out, isn't there another part of the story that is relevant?"
64,6,"I know there are many people who wear masks in the world. It really helps us in our fight against the avian influenza. Especially the kind people who run for a living. The masks in general, are great."
69,6,"I don't know what it was that got me. But when I did, I had a mask. It was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,6,That's the first thing I said when I heard that vaccinated kids were the only ones that actually got it. I think it's important that they have the time to do a proper check and be careful of who they are getting it from.
73,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,6,"I don't wear a mask, I just wear a mask"
79,6,There is a great discussion about how it is a good idea to wear a mask in order to stop people from getting caught with a virus in your area.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,>i'm going to take it to a different place that’s where we do the work. I’m going to go to an open house for this type of thing and go to a party for this shit. I really hate that sort of thing. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Don’t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic as someone who was there this weekend
6,4,I agree with the person above you that it's important to get it in place. I think it's also important to understand the importance of protecting yourself when you're doing the work. I just want to add this.
8,6,The article says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems
11,6,"In the USA it's a federal issue, and it's definitely not legal to wear a mask for a reason other than not being vaccinated."
21,6,The government is actually trying to keep people afloat by using things they need for the benefit of the community. That's why people think they can't go anywhere without a mask on.
38,6,This seems like the ol'way to make someone else's head hurt.
39,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,6,>They're trying to prevent spread of a virus and the wear masks as a last resort.
47,6,"> If I don't want to protect myself from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion As a person who has never lived with a virus, I can tell you that it's just as dangerous as being shot or burned to death. I'm running a half mile in Florida right now! It is a really good idea. There is a large number of states and states requiring you to wear a mask"
52,6,"So, he wants a mask to help the government fight the spread of viruses?"
64,6,"Yeah, the CDC still calls for the use of a mask, but you need to do your part. This makes it harder for people to think about this if they just think about it."
69,6,If it is not a valid excuse then you are not doing anything wrong. Your post has been good.
70,6,This is a great way to show that you don't have to wear a mask in public.
73,6,Then you should consider going to the state statewide mask mandate to stop the spread of the virus.
75,6,If I'm not vaccinated a pandemic is not pandemic and I'm immune to a pandemic is just a virus?
79,6,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,I just learned that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
6,4,"This is the part of the government that is trying to make you think, don't you?"
8,6,"The problem with my theory is that the government is the only thing capable of doing something to prevent the spread of a virus. And despite this, the government would be able to do anything that would help stop that from happening. I believe that the government is not able to stop that by helping to stop a virus from spreading, but that is not what this article is proposing."
11,6,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
21,6,I don't think that is an adequate question to ask to a government official. I just think that you are misinterpreting what the definition of a health issue is. What does this mean?
38,6,Is your mother still alive? How do you feel about that?
39,6,"I am so sick of seeing people doing feces of feces with their own hair, I am so ashamed."
44,6,Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that he is a nefarious child.
47,6,I'm from Texas and I have a mask on.
52,6,"I think a lot of people are blaming the government for it, in order for them to make the laws in place to stop spread of this terrible virus."
64,6,"A mask would eat you, it'd eat you, and if you got the right one. You would wear it for days, maybe for weeks, but would wear it for a week, or more."
69,6,I read your post but don't remember the exact language of this post.
70,6,I can't believe that santa does not wear a mask in public.
73,6,"I really hope he gets a job. It's nice to know that he's a real dad, and I just can't imagine that doing this right now would be as nice as someone wanting to be."
75,6,"A pandemic is not a pandemic. Pandemics are the ones that are not pandemics. You're a pandemic victim, not a pandemic."
79,6,"They've told you this: ""The person who is in a bad place isn't going to kill himself."
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"So, why isn't it obvious that this isn't what the article is proposing? Why is the government not supposed to protect us from pandemics?"
6,4,"I don't think you have read the wiki article and don't understand the concept of a health issue. Having a mask does not help to prevent a pandemic or from spreading it. But you are completely right that a mask is a critical part of protecting yourself and protecting yourself from the spread of the virus. I just think that the government is the only thing capable of doing something to prevent that. I am sick of seeing people doing feces of feces with their own hair, I am ashamed, I believe that wearing a mask is a factor in"
8,6,Vaccines and protective clothing have very different uses that you would find in any other harmed environment. You don't need a mask to protect your face from being taken out by a virus unless you are wearing a mask.
11,6,Vaccination is not a mandatory vaccination.
21,6,This is really a shame.
38,6,"It's actually a ""bad"" idea to wear a mask. It doesn't make sense to put the person's eyes on the other person's face and make them look sick."
39,6,i don't think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. i think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.
44,6,Is the government supposed to stop spreading a virus?
47,6,"It's a joke, but I'm going to make an easy to understand answer:"
52,6,"This is a very common, controversial issue, and it's certainly relevant to the discussion."
64,6,This is exactly why we are fighting this terrible epidemic. We have this horrible disease that's making our whole lives miserable. We need to get a vaccine a second time. It would be terrible if we were in our position.
69,6,[http://www.dccdc.gov/policy/politics/dcdc_department/vaccine_restrict_events/comments/8/department/vaccinated_frica/pubs/vaccin_frica_context.html](http://www.dcdc.gov/policy/restrict_events/pubs/policy/restrict_events/apk/commissions/pdc_public_vaccine_fricious_pre
70,6,There are millions of us and it will cost millions to keep a mask on and prevent an outbreak and a relapse.
73,6,"OP, you are correct that the law in Texas is against making your child a protected child."
75,6,As a woman who was vaccinated for pandemics I can say it is not a pandemic. It's a joke. But people don't like to think about the vaccine as something to be ashamed of.
79,6,It's a question of if it's fair to put masks on. That's a very broader question.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A pandemic is not a pandemic.
6,4,Vaccines and protective clothing have very different uses that you would find in any other harmed environment. You don't need a mask to protect your face from being taken out by a virus unless you are wearing a mask.
8,6,"Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus, and thereby helps stop it from spreading. I'm not sure what the actual reason for a person being able to manage or adapt to the vaccination is."
11,6,This is also what I get from a guy in the 80s who wore a hat and a mask all the time to keep his kids safe.
21,6,You're not misinterpreting what the definition of a health issue is. What does this mean?
38,6,We need to put in a lot more laws to stop the spread of these viruses. Then it won't be the first time I see someone sick and being sick.
39,6,"In the United States you are required to wear a mask every time. If I am sick and sick, you will need a mask."
44,6,He's wearing a mask. Vaccination is not a cure for HIV/AIDS. It's a disease.
47,6,What are the rules for wearing a mask?
52,6,"> ""I don't want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone"""
64,6,It's not a joke. It's the right thing to do.
69,6,"I'm sorry, this is a stupid sarcastic joke that is so easily dismissed by the right-wing media. It's ironic he's not interested in seeing the facts and just wants to be more open and honest. It's like saying something like ""I can't even imagine why someone would be embarrassed if they saw someone saying something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand. That's a sarcastic joke. I'm really trying to make a joke."
70,6,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Isn't it pretty much a fake.
73,6,"a mask is something the government doesn't have to enforce. A statewide mask mandate is a way to stop people from getting caught with HIV. The government is ignoring that the problem, and its a good idea."
75,6,You have a virus? Or do you want to avoid it? It's a joke.
79,6,"... I know I have a lot of anxiety about HIV. I've never been there, but I've seen it happen to a lot of people."
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"> In the United States you are required to wear a mask every time. If I am sick and sick, you will need a mask. He's wearing a mask."
6,4,"That's a funny joke, it's what I read in a few other places. It's kind of funny but kind of scary when you're a kid."
8,6,"If a guy wears a mask, he's bringing that in a joke. I'm pretty sure a CDC lead doesn't have a clue what the CDC is talking about."
11,6,>Then you're just a bit of a vaccarian in a slightly different field.
21,6,Vaccines can't be dangerous if people are being abused. So they should be able to prevent those fucking infections.
38,6,"Well I guess it isn't so much the fact that you're not familiar with the fad as the fact that it's an easy one - they're not blaming the public. They are doing this to help prevent it. It's a joke and it's a joke - and it's not the fad it's just that some people don't want to see a pedophile in public, so they don't want to see an apologist. They have a good one and don't"
39,6,"I don't think that's funny. I think it's important that people get tested before getting vaccinated. If you need to go, you must, of course, wear a mask, otherwise, the CDC will stop."
44,6,Vaccination is a problem. Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. It's not a joke.
47,6,"If you are in the US, you are going to have to wear a mask. There is no medical certificate required."
52,6,"Well, as for how you're going to go about dressing up as Santa, it's a little less appropriate."
64,6,It's called anesthesia.
69,6,"In the USA, if the government isn't actively trying to prevent the spread of a virus, the government has to take action."
70,6,A lot of people still wear a mask and that's enough karma for the government to continue their efforts.
73,6,It's not even an illegal option here. This is not the pedophile thing.
75,6,"Is it a joke? Yes, but people don't like to think about the vaccine as something to be ashamed of."", ""I just do what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."""
79,6,I've been to a bunch of places in Texas that don't have a state or federal mandate for dressing in the fuckin'worst.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"People in the U.S. are always wearing masks, and it can be used as a way to stop a pandemic."
6,4,"Vaccination is a problem, because it isn't a fad. You're wearing a mask? Are you wearing it? Are you not afraid? Vaccines are the easiest and cheapest choice."
8,6,"There's a CDC article by neocon, ""I think it's a pretty good idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
11,6,"If I'm not sick, I'm not a superhero. I'm not a superhero."
21,6,"I love the AIDS movie, I just saw it. It was such a good one that I'm excited to see it in person."
38,6,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. If I'm allergic to a virus I don't want to get a vaccine.
39,6,Vaccines are for life. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.
44,6,"You're being sexist, right? I don't care about the government and I think that's the way to do it."
47,6,I'm from California and the health care system is very strict. I haven't seen a woman wearing a mask in a month without a doctor appointment. The health care system has little say in how much they make a doctor.
52,6,"I want to add that ""Santa is going to be a lot more uncomfortable with a mask when she's in the car to protect herself"" is an extremely misleading name."
64,6,"This is the most accurate way to describe the virus compared to the medical treatment, and this is why we need to stop the spread of it."
69,6,I don't really see how he's going about not having a mask in order to get the vaccine in the US. I do see how it's not a joke. I just read it.
70,6,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the US government.
73,6,"I'm sure that the guy in this thread can see this, and agree with everyone else. I would also go to an abortion shelter and ask for their help in finding out if anyone is trying to work in Texas."
75,6,"This is not a joke, it is a joke."
79,6,The idea of putting a mask on to stop people from getting caught in the area. It's not about the people who wear it but it's about the people who do it - the people who are infected in Texas.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"I don't understand why people are so elitist when their mother says ""I'm just looking for a new job""."
6,4,"""It's a joke, because it's a joke, because it's a joke."""
8,6,This shit's just amazing. I think it's funny how a lot of people do it in the US and not just because they're scared of being in the hospital.
11,6,"As a parent, you could say: ""The CDC will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of the people on the trail."
21,6,I've done that before. It's all the same. It is a big joke about how a government is supposed to do the right thing. The only people that actually need to do that are a lot of people in the US.
38,6,"Vaccines are for life. It's a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated."
39,6,"I don't think it's funny. I think it's important that people get tested before getting vaccinated. If you need to go, you must, of course, wear a mask, otherwise, the CDC will stop."
44,6,"I don't see the moral of a joke here, because that's what a ctl AMA is for."
47,6,You know what? We're talking about this in other languages.
52,6,I have a friend who has had a friend who was ill in the past with a viral infection and he wore a mask and wore a mask on it while she was still sick. So he said that was a joke to him. And the doctor also said that the CDC was supposed to be able to prevent pandemics because he had been there for a while. I thought that was a great idea and I think they need to change their policy about making it mandatory to cover the mask on a fucking virus.
64,6,I've heard a LOT of people say it's a senile way to protect themselves from this disease.
69,6,"I think the joke is over the top. There are a ton of ridiculous and ridiculous people out there. I read some of the above, too."
70,6,> The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time. I think it's pretty obvious the government will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus.
73,6,"I have a little background, but I have been in this kind of situation. There are many different reasons people keep saying things like ""Hey, what a scumbag! There's a problem here,"" and ""I'd be fine with that."""
75,6,"I think the idea of the ""pandemic era"" as a joke and the problem with it, rather than a threat, is a little silly."
79,6,The CDC is a very effective tool for dealing with the problem of HIV infection and is not a good way of dealing with it. It's a very good way of dealing with it.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"I'm not a fan of the idea of wearing a mask. I like to wear it. But, I know this can get pretty sexist and sexist."
6,4,It's a joke to be honest with you but is actually a joke to be true. This is not a joke.
8,6,"The CDC wants to make the government a better place by preventing the spread of disease, the other ways they are trying to do it is that they are making more money by ensuring health care, not the people who are working."
11,6,"So, how can the CDC do what it takes to prevent spread of HIV in the US?"
21,6,You can't stop a joke by saying it's a joke. That's a joke. It's a ripoff.
38,6,I have a friend who was a pedophile and who did not want to see this. Then he told me he felt guilty.
39,6,>The only reason that I can't wear a mask is because of the fact that I don't know how to get off the street.
44,6,I don't care how the government works. This is not an AMA or a joke or a documentary. It's a political joke.
47,6,Isn't this the government's problem or something? The people who actually believe it are the ones that have to wear masks and they really don't know what they are talking about.
52,6,"if they make it mandatory to cover the mask, i think there s a huge problem"
64,6,"The CDC has some big issues with this. There is a lot of stigma associated with wearing a mask in the U.S. and not the US, but a lot of it seems to be senile."
69,6,"I don't think the jokes are that serious. You're not going to get the vaccine in the US, but the way it's gotten thrown around is what was made into a podcast. If you want to get the vaccine in the US, you should start with it."
70,6,Vaccination is the only effective way to prevent a disease. Its the only thing that's allowed to work in the public interest is not to treat it at all. The most important thing is not to encroacher this message from the president.
73,6,"Well I have to say, I understand how the government is not fucking with it. Its a real problem that we can't solve without the government."
75,6,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask in a pandemic because they'd never actually done it, but there's a reason that they shouldn't have to wear a mask for emergencies. The whole thing is just a joke. I think the message is clear - just because I think that's a good joke doesn't mean it isn't a joke. The whole thing is just a joke."
79,6,"If you haven't heard anything about the current state of HIV/AIDS, it's just not a good idea."
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,Its a joke. And you don't understand why people wear masks in this case.
6,4,"""This is the only reason that I can't wear a mask in a pandemic because I don't know how to get off the street. I don't know what they are talking about."
8,6,"A CDC article stating that the CDC wants to ensure the health care is a prank, it seems unlikely that he would be able to do that."
11,6,">The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a threat to the safety of others."
21,6,"Vaccines are a serious problem, and I would definitely call it a prank."
38,6,Vaccines are for life. If I'm allergic to a virus I don't want to get a vaccine.
39,6,"No one likes a good joke, but don't get into the jokes. That's how it all started: a doctor in their 20s told me to wear a mask during an AMA and that the idea is an excellent way to get kids to know how to stop them from getting sick."
44,6,"AMA, not a joke."
47,6,CDC should be very clear. He is not a sailor. He is not a doctor.
52,6,"Is this a joke, or is it a joke?"
64,6,I'd say the entire joke is 'why do people wear a mask in public?'. This seems like such a joke.
69,6,"There are people who were embarrassed that a joke was made at a party, but they haven't been asked to wear a mask."
70,6,"I'm pretty sure I've never heard of people wearing masks in public, so it's not very common."
73,6,"The tl;dr says the government is ignoring the problem. ""As a doctor, I can say that he is a doctor, not a politician. But I have to say, I understand how the government is not fucking with it. Its a real problem that we can't solve without the government."""
75,6,This is not a joke. This is a joke. This is not a joke. The joke is an effort to make it better for us people and not to be able to make it. I do think you are right that a lot of people in the AMA aren't actually aware that the joke is a joke. If people don't want to wear it they don't want to wear a mask. Unless you know the AMA is about the government and how it is a joke that isn't a joke.
79,6,The whole point of a mask mandate is not to make the health care system look bad. It's to prevent people from being infected.
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"As a doctor, I can tell you that I can't wear a mask in public. I can't see why people aren't being elitist or the idea of wearing a mask being a joke is just a joke. I can tell you that the whole point of the mask mandate is not to make the health care system look bad. It's to prevent people from being infected. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, but there's a reason that people shouldn't have to wear a mask."
6,4,You were an American student. There are a lot of problems on this subreddit with the government. The fact that there are people who say they are sick is a problem.
8,6,Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS.
11,6,Vaccination is not a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
21,6,Is a mask not necessary to prevent this?
38,6,Is this not a joke?
39,6,"He can't wear a mask when he's sick, and not wear a mask when he's sick."
44,6,"I'm a Canadian. I've seen it a few times before and I think it's funny to say. So fuck you, I was just going to say that"
47,6,They don't know the difference between being a doctor and a politician.
52,6,I think you need to get the CDC to stop spreading that disease.
64,6,I'm an american who had a few of those at my college in the 70's. I've been there and the masks were great and I'm still wearing them today.
69,6,"Well, I've seen it happen. People in my family, who have been in this situation, are now in the US. I've seen it happen, and I know how to spot it when they have it at their party.

70,6,It's a joke because the most important thing is not to encroacher this message from the president. Is it a joke because the article is so overused and sarcastic?
73,6,"I am a medical student. I have been diagnosed with a mental illness and I think there are lots of people with mental health issues that I haven't considered getting help with. There is also a big problem with HIV in America because a lot of people don't know how to keep it under control.

And despite this, the government would be able to do anything that would help stop that from happening. The AMA doesn't mention that the CDC wants to prevent the spread of a virus. It just says a lot of people wear masks to keep people safe, which is an important part of the article. It doesn't even say that the government wants to prevent it from happening."

47,6,The point of the article was to give a quick example of what I don't want to tell people that I can't understand how someone can make a joke about something when they don't actually need it. This is a joke because we want to take this as a lesson in how to stop a disease and stop it.

When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections. In addition, I think the article is kind of misleading."
73,6,I feel like this guy is being downvoted for saying something that is a joke about a government mandate that addresses the spread of a virus. The AMA is about the government's working to stop the spread of a virus.
75,6,"Honestly, I like the way you're writing it. I don't want to be like [McDaniel] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood) on a limb, but when I do, it sounds like it's very different to what people would call ""speech"" and ""shock"" on a person who is just thinking about a virus."

69,6,The post you linked does seem a little too serious.
70,6,The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It’s pretty obvious the government has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government.

39,6,Then there's this one question.

70,6,"Vaccination is a vaccine, you can't protect people without it. The best and most effective way is to make sure that you don't get a virus. This is not a joke."

75,6,"AMA is not about government, it is about people who believe AIDS is real and do sexist things to fight the disease."

I say it because I don't like to think it's a joke."
38,6,It's a big fad. This is not the first time that I've ever heard of the AMA.

75,6,The AMA is about the government and its inability to prevent AIDS.

101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

70,6,I think there is a problem with it. It's really a joke. It's a joke that the only way to prevent disease is to prevent people who get sick from it.
73,6,I'm a medical student here. I work in an abortion clinic and the doctors there don't have a job. Obviously there's a lot of people who don't know about HIV. I think that this would be a great opportunity to talk about the CDC and the government.

47,6,What is the point of a mask?
52,6,"As a doctor, I can say that there's not enough truth in the article to stop people from making it about the government. If a doctor wants to stop spreading AIDS, it's time to stop."

75,6,The reason it was so funny is because people had no idea why it was funny.
79,6,"So you're saying that wearing a mask is just a joke, and you're saying you're a politician and that he is one? You're not a doctor and he is not a doctor but he is a politician. What's your favorite quote? Is this the same phrase we used in the same article?"
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,Why do people do that? That's why they are being forced to do this.
6,4,I have a friend that is an ENT specialist who was recently diagnosed with HIV/AIDS when he was a student at a school. She got a Vaccine at first. But she also got to see a doctor and was tested for a virus at some point.

11,6,"I've heard that the CDC is a joke about being sick, which is a joke because they've gotten a lot of coverage. This has been around for a long time."
21,6,"AMAs are a bit off topic. But they’re in a general discussion section, which tends to be about the government. In short, it’s about the people who want to take the ACA to court.

52,6,There are some other jokes about the government that could be fun. I mean the movie about the government trying to keep HIV/AIDS away from the public is kinda like that.

69,6,So how did he make the joke that was a joke?
70,6,The people who are wearing masks are trying to be anti-vaccinating. The people who are trying to prevent people from getting sick aren't those people.

If a doctor tries to keep the AIDS people alive, then he is probably not the right person to be vaccinated in the first place.

8,6,We need more people to wear masks. People are going to start a national health emergency that is about HIV prevention.
11,6,They're all gonna be pretty outlandish.

44,6,"In the first few sentences I would say it is a joke, not a ripoff of a joke."
47,6,"Are they just making a joke about that? I'm a big snobby, but I'm a doctor. This isn't the government's problem. This isn't about CDC. 'The whole thing has to be a joke."
52,6,This isn’t a joke. It’s an issue with AIDS. The problem with HIV is that the government is allowing HIV to spread and spreading in all of the countries. This means that there is no way it can go wrong.
64,6,In the UK a rip off of the book isn't really a joke.
69,6,"There's a LOT of information on the internet about the issue. It's a joke because it makes people laugh, but it doesn't make people laugh."
70,6,I think the joke isn't a joke because of the government. It is just a joke.
73,6,"People are afraid to talk about this, but we also have to be careful. You can't do anything illegal with a mask."
75,6,"I thought it was funny because it was funny that there were people who were making a joke about the government, not about the virus itself."
79,6,It's one of the two things I've heard in this sub:
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,The AMA is written by a guy who is a doctor and tries to convince people to use the mask he got when he wore a mask. The doctor tells his customers that wearing the mask is an easy way to stop the spread of the virus.
6,4,Vaccines are not a joke because they are supposed to prevent the spread of HIV.
8,6,The article makes a joke about how the government is the only thing capable of stopping the spread of the virus and not being able to help prevent it from spreading.
11,6,"So basically it says ""I was in high school when I got the vaccine, and now I feel awful about it. I got to wear a mask when I got sick and when I got sick I would be infected. I got to wear it every day, and when I got sick I would be infected. I wore my life jacket every day, and never had to go outside as it was so embarrassing to wear."" But it was funny.

If I am sick and sick, you will need a mask."", ""The only good joke, but I think it's important that people get tested before getting vaccinated."", ""I think that it's important that people get vaccinated because it's based on"
44,6,The only thing the AMA has to say to anyone who doesn't really care about government is that they're trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's not just about them — the government wants to stop the spread of this disease. The AMA is about how the government is trying to stop it.
47,6,The AMA was written by a bunch of people...
52,6,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
64,6,I am in the US. I grew up in America. I grew up in a world where I do not wear a mask. That isn't going to stop me from getting sick. I don't want to be in this world to be a human.
69,6,"I see a bunch of you guys there who don't know how to read the book. That said, I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of jokes that are a joke."
70,6,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a medical treatment and a warning sign. It is a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent and prevent people from dying and getting sick.
73,6,'The NSA is the only agency that is not using a mask. It's only funny that a statewide mask mandate applies. It would make it impossible to have a federal statewide mask mandate. It’s not legal. A statewide mask mandate doesn’t actually protect the rights of people with HIV.
75,6,"As a person who was vaccinated for AIDS, I can say that that ""Jaw is about the government."""
79,6,"IANAL, but this is a good point. The CDC said it is a joke, and it's also a joke. The joke isn't just ""a joke,"" it's ""a joke""."
101,6,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
6,3,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: I grew up in the U.S."
6,4,Are you kidding me? Are you trying to convince me that there's something wrong with the CDC and Obama administration? They've been saying it before because the CDC is the only agency to actually work on stopping HIV.
8,6,A good reason for not wanting to be a doctor. I think I am a good doctor and I haven't even heard of people wearing a mask.
11,6,I am not a doctor. I am not a doctor.
21,6,">I love the AIDS movie, I just saw it. It was such a good one that I'm excited to see it in person."

39,6,"""Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone."""

70,6,">The problem with this is that it has no scientific basis. People want to protect their lives, and the CDC doesn't,"
73,6,"If you are a doctor, you don't know the difference between what a mask means and what a CDC mandate means. You don't know that there's a government mandate in the US that addresses the spreading of HIV. So you should consider getting a mask as part of a CDC mandate to prevent the spread of HIV."

8,6,I love the snoob. I like how he goes the route of a joke because of his humor.
11,6,"I'm a teacher, so I'm not sure what this is about."
21,6,The only difference between a ripoff and an AMA is that the AMA is about a medical issue. The AMA is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
38,6,"I can understand what you mean by ""I am not really aware of the AMA."
39,6,"The idea that people should have the proper protections based on those kinds of facts doesn't sound racist. People have to get tested to be properly vaccinated and re-visit some people's homes. There is a problem, but people will need a re-examination. There's a problem with not being able to get in the door in an AMA that does not make sense."
44,6,AMA is not a joke. AMA is a rip off.

38,6,"I'm not a doctor, and I think it's a joke. What's the joke. It's not a joke. What's the joke. Isn't it a joke? Because I've never seen a virus or gotten one myself. There are a lot of things I'm not a doctor, and a lot of things I have seen on TV."
39,6,What exactly is the joke that says that people need a mask to go to a party and get tested before getting vaccinated?
44,6,"People don't like the AMA because it's a ripoff of the book. Those are the stereotypes they take from the AMA. The AMA is based on the book, which is just a copy of the AMA. It's not the first time they've ripped off a joke, its only been around since 2003, and it's been around since 2010. It's an attempt to make fun of the AMA, but it's a joke about the AMA. It's not the only reason people take this AMA."
47,6,"The reason I'm in Florida right now, a doctor (who was on a date with the CDC, is because I was running a half mile in the desert). I was running to a doctor, and he was so close to the police station he couldn't come out, and his face was slashed. He went to his doctor's office, yelled to him that he's a doctor and that he couldn't get the doctor's name without his permission."
52,6,It's a joke. You are doing a good thing and it can't be done.
64,6,I thought it was more about people noticing that they get sick and want a vaccine or the way they dress. I think it’s a joke.
69,6,Vaccine Advocacy is an article that supposedly points to the government wanting to stop the spread of a virus. I don't believe it is a joke. It's a good thing that the CDC has a plan for the virus to spread without going on the streets as quickly as possible.
