87,44,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
90,44,Here's the thing about wearing a mask in public.
93,44,"If you can put yourself at risk, the risk is more than just a few seconds to get them all out."
44,2,"So you're just saying ""I don't think you are gonna do anything good today and you aren't gonna do anything good tomorrow."" OP is absolutely right that ""I wear a mask because I've been vaccinated and I'm afraid of infection."" I just wanted to say that ""I'm saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.mask protect other people he only cares about himself, what do you have to walk a block away?"" That's all I"
44,4,"I'm going to try to put my face in a face mask, I'll wear it and I'll never get it."

44,22,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,23,I was never going to wear a mask in public. I was more concerned about my health. I didn't want to have to walk.
44,31,So you're in a big deal. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.mask protect other people he only cares about himself.
44,32,Hi! It's been great talking to you! What is your favorite slang?
44,41,> I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe.
50,44,What do you think is the point of a statewide mask mandate?
55,44,He is a great artist. He is a woman. He can play with you in the public spaces. He can do the work for you in the private spaces.
74,44,he spelled it wrong : wear a mask.
81,44,He's a nefarious child. He is wearing a mask.
87,44,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
90,44,"I just want to say that if I wear a mask and keep distance and think hey i think about it all the time, but I don't think about it too much that I'd do something I couldn't do if I did, but not this time. So I'll say that if you wear a mask and keep distance and think hey i think about it all the time, but I don't think about it too much that I'd do something I couldn't do if I did, but not this time."
93,44,In the US there's no such thing as a mask. If you were in the US it would be a big deal.
44,2,I'm wearing a mask and don't want to be that guy. It makes me nervous.
44,4,I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
44,6,Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that he is a nefarious child.
44,9,"A good thing people can have masks. If you're trying to prevent spreading of a virus, you have to wear a mask to prevent you from getting one. Obviously the only way to stop it is to have a vaccinating campaign."
44,22,It's not a big deal. It's just an inhumane prick who wants to do things that are wrong.
44,23,"I feel like you're implying that the US's AIDS epidemic doesn't exist as it is now, but that the state does. You don't need a mask, you need to go. You're on your own. It's a thing, you know?"
44,31,>He's a great artist. He is a woman. He can play with you in the public spaces. He can do the work for you in the private spaces.
44,32,I'm sorry to hear about your vaccinated. I've been vaccinated because I'm afraid of infection.
44,41,"Well... I don't think they know it, because they've been there. It's the government that puts people at risk. They're doing it to prevent the spread of a virus."
50,44,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
55,44,"I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,44,"I think the only issue here is that a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus, as the vaccines are supposed to and will not prevent that."
81,44,"I read a video where Santa wears a mask and the doctor says to the kid, ""That's not a very good thing unless you can get vaccinated. If you can't get vaccinated, you can still get vaccinated. I think a mask is a good thing."""
87,44,>I don't understand why this is so common. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help.
90,44,I think your last two words are pretty funny.
93,44,There's some very tame facts on this sub:
44,2,"I'm not sure where to start, but you can ask OP to shave off a scar with a mask."
44,4,"Vaccination is not a cure for HIV/AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
44,6,Is the government supposed to stop spreading a virus?
44,9,The only way to stop this is to have a vaccinating campaign.
44,22,"People wear masks because of the threat of viruses. In this case, someone will take them to the CDC and prescribe them. They're usually in the hospital or in a safe environment, so there isn't really an answer yet."
44,23,>He's a great artist. He is a woman. He can play with you in the public spaces. He can do the work for you in the private spaces. I'm sorry to hear about your vaccinated. I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this. Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
44,31,>The fact that he is wearing a mask
44,32,"I'm not sure if it's a serious topic, but the truth is that a medical care is not only necessary, but it is essential to keep someone healthy and happy. Vaccinations are needed in order to keep a child safe."
44,41,Vaccination is a very popular and well known topic of discussion. I think you've got a really good point.
50,44,What does that say about the federal government?
55,44,"In my experience people wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face."
74,44,"I've seen the scar in a prank video when a friend was getting sick. I'd say ""we should all go and talk to our doc and have a face wash"""
81,44,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. Wearing a mask in the parade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcare heroes wearamask.
87,44,>A lot of the time in the mid 1990s and my daughter was vaccinated so she could be vaccinated and go to a doctor or something.
90,44,"If they wear a mask all the time, they feel bad."
93,44,"I think this is not the right response to the current situation in the US, but this is a funny one that isn't a joke."
44,2,I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this. Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here? The fact that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
44,4,This is a very well known topic that's a joke.
44,6,He's wearing a mask. Vaccination is not a cure for HIV/AIDS. It's a disease.
44,9,It's a prank and it's not a joke.
44,22,Why are people in this sub? If a virus is infected the government will stop it from spreading. Vaccinations are not an answer for everyone. They are just as important to keep people healthy and happy.
44,23,"What's not to know about the CDC, which is a large CDC organization?"
44,31,Well that's the joke.
44,32,I would be happy to wear my face masks and shave off the scar if I could but I also would want to not go to the CDC if I could because I'm scared of infection.
44,41,Is wearing a mask an issue that isn't addressed here?
50,44,Vaccination is the only cure. It is necessary. You are not alone.
55,44,"I am in New Mexico, and the first time a NSA agent effected me is I was just playing with my friends in a restaurant in a park. Then I went out to see him, and he just came to me, telling me he was infected. Then I went to a clinic in a city in the state, and I saw an eye doctor for the first time. I think there is no one at all."
74,44,">I'm a doctor who's a child and I have to be pretty careful with a child's re-doing of the doc's care. I think that in order to stop the spread of a virus, a mask is necessary."
81,44,The only way we can see this in the movie is when you see Santa's face.
87,44,"I don't think this is just another AMA. I'm not sure if it is just a AMA but this is just one AMA. I'm not sure if it is a AMA, or a AMA. I don't think the AMA is a good thing either."
90,44,"If they wear a mask, they are doing the most dangerous thing they can in their lives."
93,44,I think it's a bit of a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
44,2,This is the way to do it. The guy wearing a mask is just being silly. It's a prank.
44,4,I can imagine the horrors of seeing that face in a mask is a bit in my head. I wouldn't wear a mask and feel bad about seeing someone in a mask.
44,6,Vaccination is a problem. Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. It's not a joke.
44,9,"""...the only way to stop this is to have a vaccinating campaign."""
44,22,I'd love to have my daughter with me on our parade for the first time.
44,23,Vaccination is not a cure. It's a prank and it's not a joke. I think this is a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
44,31,You are being silly. In the beginning of a story there was a whole thread about how you can never be safe on the road. You are asking for a joke.
44,32,"I'm a doctor, and while I've never really been vaccinated, I believe the only cure for HIV/AIDS is shave the scar. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy."
44,41,This isn't a joke.
50,44,It doesn't say anything about the government at all.
55,44,"> I love that people are afraid to take their hands off for a minute or two. I don’t think the government would need to make an effort to stop it. I’m going to go ahead and post this, I think it’s a great idea to do it."
74,44,"I think he means ""I can't be that bad""."
81,44,"There are no laws regarding wearing masks when a child hasn't been vaccinated, and no law concerning the government's use of them. They are a way to protect their children from their own harmful effects."
87,44,> I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe.
90,44,You wear a mask and you don't fap yourself?'
93,44,"I think I saw a piece of this about a girl who was bitten by a cold and was infected with a fever, but I wasn't very surprised. The only time that I noticed it was on a run, it was on the moon."
44,2,"He's a joke. He's just being silly. He's not saying a rip off, but you're being silly."
44,4,"Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
44,6,"You're being sexist, right? I don't care about the government and I think that's the way to do it."
44,9,I don't think he was referring to the AMA.
44,22,"> ""The only way we can see this in the movie is when you see Santa's face."
44,23,I know a lot of people who think that the best way to stop AIDS is to have a Vaccination Campaign.
44,31,I've just heard the sexist part. There is no law regarding wearing a mask while a child hasn't been vaccinated.
44,32,Vaccination is not the answer for everyone. It doesn't say anything about the government at all.
44,41,It's not a joke. There's a big issue with it.
50,44,"My kids aren't using the mask for the same reason they do, but I'm still not convinced."
55,44,"I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what you mean by a joke?"
74,44,I know a few people who have AIDS and I am not too surprised to see how it all turns out.
81,44,"I didn't know this, I'm not a child"
87,44,"The AMA doesn't really do anything. People tend to be so uncomfortable when they wear a mask outside while vaccinated. This isn't a joke, it's just an attempt to be an asshole."
90,44,"> ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows. It's a mask that I wear because a fat lip in and nobody knows."""
93,44,"You're describing the santa and the moon movie as a ""Film. I have not seen it before. If I have not watched it I wouldn't have guessed it's a joke."
44,2,"I jumped to the conclusion that this whole post is a joke, a joke, the reason you're being silly."
44,4,"If I had a child who had the Vaccination Campaign, I'd wear a mask and a face mask."
44,6,"I don't see the moral of a joke here, because that's what a ctl AMA is for."
44,9,"Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
44,22,This is ridiculously misleading. This is the best way to help people who are going to get a vaccine.
44,23,I'm not sure if he was making a joke.
44,31,"You can't have a joke about AIDS. You can have a joke about people not wanting to risk the AIDS epidemic, or even just to be ignorant to people about it. The AMA does not really do anything. Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak. You're being silly. I'm not a child. I'm not saying he was referring to the AMA at all."
44,32,I think it's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It doesn't say anything about the government at all.
44,41,"I think you just're describing the santa and the moon movie' as a ""Film. I have not seen it before. If I haven't watched it I wouldn't have guessed it's a joke."
50,44,'I've never seen any people being attacked by someone in a public place by the government. The fact that it's a joke is not the only reason I think a santa's wearing a mask is a joke.
55,44,"I don't think I have the ability to tell the difference between a joke and a joke. I just think that it would be funny to get around the notion that someone isn't going to do it or do it, and that it's a joke."
74,44,"The problem isn't the AIDS, it's the lack of an irrational desire to stop the spread. I would not care how it turns out and I would not wish to be a cliche. The reason for a'most people' going to do it is because they don't feel comfortable about it."
81,44,"The title is snide. It's a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. I don't think it's a good idea, but it makes sense."
87,44,>Is it because the AMA is really about vaccines?
90,44,"Basically, the government is making noise in the government's shit and putting a stop to it."
93,44,"I am not a santa, and I do not agree with your description of the movie."
44,2,"> The AMA doesn't really do anything. People tend to be so uncomfortable when they wear a mask outside while vaccinated. This isn't a joke, it's just an attempt to be an asshole."
44,4,">I don't see the moral of a joke here, because that's what a ctl AMA is for. Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
44,6,I don't care how the government works. This is not an AMA or a joke or a documentary. It's a political joke.
44,9,"It doesn't seem like there is much sexism there. And yes, it's misleading."
44,22,I am not sure if he was referring to the AMA at all. You're being silly. I think it's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy. It's pretty sexist to say that vaccines don't keep people healthy.
44,23,It's the most fun of all the jokes.
44,31,>You're being silly. I'm not a child. I'm not saying he was referring to the AMA at all.
44,32,"A doctor has to wear a mask every day. It's uncomfortable, people are uncomfortable and they have to do it if they feel unsafe."
44,41,"I see what you mean. I've been on the internet a couple of times, and I can tell you that the AMA is not a joke, but rather a satire of the issue. If people didn't know this, they wouldn't have guessed it."
50,44,"You nailed it. But it was funny, and yes, it is hilarious."
55,44,"People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I would wear a mask. It's hard to believe that it's a joke, but the actual joke isn't funny."
74,44,I agree with you in the joke that is just a generalization.
81,44,I thought that you meant the title is a joke.
87,44,People tend to be so uncomfortable when they wear a mask outside while vaccinated.
90,44,I have a bunch of the same issues.
93,44,I think this is a bit of a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
44,2,"I've also been told that while the title of the AMA may be somewhat sexist, this doesn't actually mean ""to be funny."" So you're just saying you don't think you can wear a mask because you've been vaccinated? That doesn't sound like you're being silly. I'm not saying you are being silly, but it's a joke. This is not the place to say something, I'm just saying it's not a joke."
44,4,"""That's not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."", """
44,6,"AMA, not a joke."
44,9,"As a Canadian, I find this a joke because of how much people tend to hate the AMA. They want to take it for granted. They don't want to be in the AMA or a documentary or anything. The joke isn't just about how the vaccines are getting distributed, it's about how it's effectively being a joke in order to avoid spreading the disease. This is a political joke, because it's the AMA and it's not about the vaccines."
44,22,I think the AMA is an attempt to be an asshole.
44,23,I'm not a doctor. You're being silly. I'm not saying he was making a joke at all.
44,31,It's the most fun of all the jokes.
44,32,"It's not a joke, it's a joke that isn't funny."
44,41,"If you see an AMA, you're describing the AMA in a more rational way."
50,44,"This isn't about the government... this is about the person's health care system. If they want to try and prevent the spread of HIV, then they should definitely get a vaccine."
55,44,Having a mask to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. They can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

90,44,> I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows. It’s a mask that I wear because a fat lip in and nobody knows.
93,44,I don't think there is any way to tell how silly a 'the man in the hat' joke is in the US.
44,2,It seems like the AMA in the USA is really about the healthcare system and not about the person being vaccinated.
44,4,"I've always been terrified of my friends wearing face masks, because of the dangers they are exposed to."
44,6,"I'm a Canadian. I've seen it a few times before and I think it's funny to say. So fuck you, I was just going to say that"
44,9,"I mean, it was a prank, but people are still ignoring it, they seem to have found that this is a joke. The AMA is a joke about the federal government."
44,22,The joke is a bit sexist. The AMA is an attempt to be a joke.
44,23,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure I was in the right at the time, but I didn't like it, and I've never really liked it."
44,31,"IMHO that if you are in the US, you are very likely not going to be able to afemt the AMA. A lot of med school teachers like this in the US don't want to take you to the AMA. They say that they aren't going to be able to have the AMA done. They're just saying that if you wear a mask at school, you will only be able to have a med school experience. And because you aren't a doctor at work, this joke is a joke"

87,44,"The AMA (or ""my health is a joke"") is supposed to be about preventing the spread of a disease. There are other things you can do in the US that can help."
90,44,I don't think the answer is anything more than that.
93,44,The 'I don't think there's any way to tell how silly a 'the man in the hat' joke is in the US'.
44,2,I don't see the difference between the two. I don't see how people with this disease should be subject to AMA.

55,44,I'm not a doctor. I just play with friends.
74,44,The point is that I think a joke doesn't change its subject. It just means the government has done a lot to assist with a virus and a good joke doesn't change a generalization. That's the entire point of the article. It doesn't change how the government tries to aid in preventing the spread of the disease and isn't really about the people being vaccinated.
81,44,"I read a video where Santa wears a mask and the doctor says to the kid, ""That's not a very good thing unless you can get vaccinated. If you can't get vaccinated, you can still get vaccinated."" I think it's a good joke. A good laugh at this is that they seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on how this works, rather than putting on a mask themselves."
87,44,So what is a AMA about? A health AMA for the public. How is it about vaccinations for children?
90,44,"I hate when I'm on the run in a pub, when I'm dressed up, and when I go out for a drink, I wear a mask and then I'm not even there. And when I get a cold, I don't even know what I'm running."
93,44,I was able to take some of that information and not be surprised. Then I read it again and laughed again.
44,2,I would never get sick unless my parents told me that they can't be vaccinated because they are afraid to come in and not want to put them through the pain and anxiety of a virus--especially if they are not completely protected.
44,4,A bunch of AMAs are sexist. The one in the article is just a joke.
44,6,"No, 'It's a joke, not a joke, just a joke'."
44,9,AMA (Miracle Health Awareness Month): A short story of one of my friends who hasn't received the vaccine. She says her doctor said she could not get it without her mask on.
44,22,They make a joke about the fact that we - a lot of people - wear masks at work to prevent people from getting sick unless they are pregnant. But they do not help people in the workplace. You have no idea what you're talking about here.
44,23,It's a rip off. Like a movie or a fable.
44,31,AMA is actually a joke about a guy being sick and dying. He's a good artist. He can do the work for a man in the street.
44,32,I'd like to add to that that AMA is in fact a joke. I've been vaccinated for my skin type HIV/AIDS and have not been in any sort of contact with anybody with this disease since I was 17. AMA is not a joke. It is just a joke.

50,44,So what you are saying is that 'we're making a joke' means you need to wear a mask and a helmet to protect you and your family from being infected?
55,44,Getting a virus is actually not as easy as getting it. You aren't going to be able to get sick or sick from wearing a mask.
74,44,"It doesn't matter what the joke is about, it's about how the government tries to stop the spread of a disease."
81,44,I think the main point of a joke is that the government has a role in the spread of viruses.
87,44,"AMA, is a generalization that the government is trying to protect children by being a ""joke"". AMA is not a joke, it is the name of a website that has many links on it. It also supposedly aims to discourage a host of issues, such as childhood asthma. AMA is a way to prevent people from spreading a disease because they don't want to take it personally, and people just want to make them feel safe and safe. It is not a joke."
90,44,"I am sure you have a lot of good ideas about how to prevent viremia, the most dangerous thing they can do in their lives."
93,44,"Then you start laughing again. I'm not sure if it's just a rip off of the book, but I think it's a ripoff of the book."
44,2,""" AMA (Miracle Health Awareness Month): A short story about one of my friends who hasn't received the vaccine. She says her doctor said she could not get it without her mask on. They make a joke about the fact that we - a lot of people - wear a mask at work to prevent people from getting sick unless they are pregnant."
44,4,I would rather the government do a AMA than the AMA.
44,6,"If I were to use the term ""came from a nefarious child"" I would just call it a joke. If I could make a joke that I'd say I'd rather be a child and not get sick, I would. I would just say it's a joke."
44,9,I would never get sick unless my parents told me that they can't get vaccinated. But they do not want to be in the AMA and they seem to have found that this is a joke. AMA is a joke about the government. The one in the article is a joke.
44,22,"I know this is just a joke, but I think they are trying to show the people how to prevent disease, not just a joke."
44,23,"I don't think I could be a good actor. I think the AMA is a bit gross, too."
44,31,It's also the biggest reason why AMA is not allowed at all. Its about how people should be protected and how it can be done at home and the workplace. Its only the beginning.

44,31,Why are we the jokers for the government? It's one of many things.
44,32,I think it's a little bit of an absurdity to say that the government is trying to prevent a virus by making it a joke. They are trying to stop it from spreading in the US.
44,41,AMA. The people you talked about are making a very bad joke.
50,44,"And it says that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV, not that it is a bad idea."
55,44,"So, to the public? How was this a joke? Isn't it a joke to make it seem like a joke? Do you have any proof?"
74,44,"I would like to add that I have had the opportunity to speak to someone about something I didn't think was relevant, and this made me want to be embarrassed about it."
81,44,"The joke is not a joke, but a joke."
87,44,Why is the AMA? AMA is the whole point of AMAs.

44,2,"In my experience, the majority of AMAs do not address the issue, but if people are vaccinated, it will do their part to help stop the spread of the disease. It is about the fact that everyone is getting sick, and doesn't have to be vaccinated, even if it is a new vaccine. And as someone who is vaccinated, I think this is a bit of a rip off."

44,32,I think that a joke like that is just a ripoff of a joke like an AMA and is being a ripoff of a joke about a government AMA about a vaccine.
44,41,That's pretty clear. You're missing a key point here.

55,44,I can't imagine how the CDC would feel about that.
74,44,They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The government is trying to make fun of the CDC.
81,44,A few things that make the joke a joke:
87,44,AMA is about prevention. AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus.
90,44,"Yes, but this has been discussed in a number of places, including the CDC."
93,44,"It's also the one who's actually making a joke. The writer's description of the movie is ripoff of the book, so it makes a lot of sense to me."
44,2,"AMA is about the healthcare system. They are about the healthcare system. It is about the fact that everyone is getting sick, and doesn't have to be vaccinated.

44,32,It's also a joke because the article is just a joke and not a joke.
44,41,"You don't mention that this is a joke, it's just that it is a joke. That's the only time the article is a joke."
