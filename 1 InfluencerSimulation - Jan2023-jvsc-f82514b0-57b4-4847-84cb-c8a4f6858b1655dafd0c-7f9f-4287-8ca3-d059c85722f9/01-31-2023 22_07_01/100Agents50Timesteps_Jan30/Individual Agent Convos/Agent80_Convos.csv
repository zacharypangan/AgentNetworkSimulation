88,80,Almost every person in the US has gotten a vaccine. That's a joke.
91,80,"In the end, you're able to get out of the house with your mask when you get home, but if you don't, it's hard to make it out of bed with the mask. During the week, it can be difficult to be out with a good mask. Unless you're in a hurry - I would say your mom is more helpful than I am."
98,80,"If your husband has a phobia, you are being a jerk. You are a jerk. You have a problem."
80,37,This is a VERY common issue I hear about about the government. They've been in the news and have written about it and it's been very helpful for the CDC. They've said it's part of the health system and a lot of other things about it. The government isn't acting like a joke anymore.
80,38,I think a joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. That is the point of this article. I'm not going to say that. This is just a joke.
80,41,"""I think we can make a problem out of a mask if we make a problem out of it. It will be a joke and it will be a joke if we do it."""
80,61,"Yes, I know how that joke comes across. But the first half of the joke is pretty serious. I don't know how it's going to sound. I don't even have a single problem with it."
80,67,">Is it a joke, and it's a joke?"
81,80,Vaccination is not a joke. It is just a joke.
83,80,I'm not sure about the other comments.
86,80,They need to be paid to go to the doctors and other medical professionals. It's an easy way to get sick.
88,80,"I think if you really do like the joke about a masked person, it would be better for you to be comfortable and safe and know that there is no danger of the infection if you have a masked person in your place. Probably because you're scared but not if you don't know about the joke about that person and that person doesn't even know it's a joke."
91,80,"I do like to paint. I like to play, but I am not a fan of that."
98,80,"The article is on the first part of the joke (The CDC's role in this is to stop the spread of HIV), and not the second part of the joke (''The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, it's not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, it's not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV, the CDC's role in this)."
80,37,I feel like people are too dumb to be understanding. It's a joke because it's one of the most general jokes that comes across in any situation.
80,38,"As a child, I had a phobia of HIV that I wanted to get vaccines for - that was not a good idea, because it made my life very hard for me."
80,41,I mean it's not like we have a joke but we're talking about a system that isn't actually working.
80,61,"The AMA is about what the AMA is about, not whether it is a joke. The AMA is about the government and it's purpose. The AMA is about how the government is using a mask to stop a virus from spreading in the middle of the country, and it's about how it's not going to stop it. The AMA is about the government."
80,67,"AMA (the official title) on 'Muslims,' ""Sucks to know I'm on the wrong side of this list... so I'm on the right side of this.'"
81,80,"It sounds like the joke was made from the beginning, and I didn't understand what was going on."
83,80,"I don't know. I know the fact that you need a job and need a job is just not funny, and I'd say it's a joke. Isn't it funny that they're trying to make a joke about people who wear a mask and not the government, which has nothing to do with the government's desire to make it a joke?"
86,80,People need to get vaccinated.
88,80,I don't know. I can't believe that they've sworn the doctors are infected so often.
91,80,I am so psyched that the two terms are describing people who could potentially get infected with a virus and/or the possibility of dying. I am very happy with my mask.
98,80,I'm going to have to agree with you that it's not a joke. It's a joke.
80,37,The CDC is not legally required to prohibit people from buying and selling public health kits and vaccines.
80,38,AMA. No joke. Just a gimmick. A joke.
80,41,"I'd say the whole point is that it's a joke. It's not about the government, but about how it's going to work."
80,61,People who wear a mask all the time to fuck up a lot of people. People don't want to hear a fucking joke when they get vaccinated.
80,67,"They want to prevent the spread of HIV. There's a lot of evidence to support their claim, but if people can't get their masks in order to keep people safe, a lot of the media and the public will assume that they aren't correct."
81,80,You’re not a joke. You’re a joke. You’re not a joke. You’re a joke.
83,80,This is a ripoff of the book.
86,80,I think this article is getting more and more eloquent and gets more eloquent.
88,80,It is an American thing to joke about and a joke to hate about the world as a whole.
91,80,"They are not addressing the problem with the government, they are addressing the problem with the national health association."
98,80,This is the most basic but very short answer that I can give.
80,37,... and because of their failure to stop the spread of the virus.
80,38,"The AMA is attempting to rip off the government, so the government isn't the issue."
80,41,"Yes, a fap will stop a virus from spreading in the middle of the country. You'll get sick of a virus, and you can't do anything about it."
80,61,"It's funny, but it's not the joke it is a joke and that's all it's about. It's a joke about how the government wants to prevent a problem of HIV. It's not about the government. They are addressing the problem with the government."
80,67,AMA is a joke.
81,80,The whole point of the title of the article was to make the joke sound like a joke. A joke about the CDC is a joke. It's a joke because it is the government's only action.
83,80,A ripoff of a book is not a ripoff of a book. A ripoff of a book is not a ripoff of a book.
86,80,It's more like a joke about the government that's in the headline.
88,80,I am sorry that you are being so critical of what they say. But I think the joke is kinda funny. Is there a reason the joke is so widely used?

98,80,"I think it's a joke. I think the first part of it makes sense that I should be a bit more specific, because I am a person that has a phobia, and I think people who wear them are getting it, and they aren't being trolled. It's a joke."
80,37,"It's a joke, as in:"
80,38,"The point is not that they can just tell you to stop using a joke to stop it, it is just that they are attempting to sell the vaccines to people who need it most. It is because the AMA is misleading and not in accordance with the mandates of the CDC and the media. It is in violation of the federal and state law to prohibit selling vaccines and masks. It is not funny, but it is a joke, it's a joke. It is a joke about how the government can do, and the government has no obligation to protect the public"

81,80,The people who snort the jokes. I think that is a joke.
83,80,"I think it's funny because the fact that you don't think it's funny is misleading, and just like in the case of an unrelated rape, the whole story is a hoax. The rape of a rape is actually a kind of joke. Until the rape of a woman in a story about a woman being forced to wear a mask because of a crime, the story isn't a joke."
86,80,"“I don’t see why people are numb to the notion of being vaccinated. But I don’t know what the AMA is about,“ –““It’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke, it’s a joke."

80,67,I am not a doctor. I have not been in the hospital since being infected.
81,80,"I can't think of a better way to phrase it. It seems like we’re trying to say something that makes you feel better and isn't in the end a joke. If you’re just trying to be funny, you need to figure out what this is about. But that’s just how we’re at it."
83,80,"""The CDC is not legally required to prohibit people from wearing a mask on a job, because they are not legally required to do so"""
86,80,They also have a number of reasons why people don't get vaccinated.

91,80,I’m sorry that this has happened. I can’t believe that it happened. I will do whatever I can.
98,80,"I'm not trying to be racist, but I do think a good deal of the jokes you wrote are not very funny. I'd be annoyed with my husband who wore a mask to protect himself, and that he's getting a fucking scar from seeing a CDC mask in public, and is trying to tell his wife about it in the name of ""Had you seen your mask before?"""
80,37,"I think it's just a joke that the government isn't helping, but that is just a joke."

81,80,The problem with the CDC's approach is that they can't say it's a joke and they can't make a joke about it because it doesn't make sense.
83,80,I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
86,80,I would say AMA is one of the jokes. It's about the government trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
88,80,This is why it is called a joke.

80,37,>the government is not legally required to prohibit people from buying and selling public health kits and vaccines. There is nothing to this.
80,38,The joke is the AMA. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
80,41,"Basically, it’s a joke."
80,61,"If you have a history of having HIV, it may be very difficult to get vaccines and it's not that common to go and get vaccinated, but they're extremely common in the US. For example, you don't need to get a new HIV vaccine, so it is not really the only option to prevent it. You just don't see the jokes. It's a joke."
80,67,I think the phrase is just a joke and I'd like to say that it was funny because I have a lot of reassurances about it.
81,80,Vaccination is a joke unless it's used to prevent the spread of a virus.
83,80,I'm so sorry. I can't explain my response to you.
86,80,"A lot of people don't get the joke. That's why people are sick of the AMA, mainly to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are for life."
88,80,I’m pretty sure the joke is meant to be a joke.
91,80,I think the idea that people have a right to be safe is just one part of the problem with the government.
98,80,"You think wearing a mask is a joke? You are describing a joke that is used to stop the spread of a virus. A funny thing to say is, 'The first part of it makes me feel a bit of a dick, but I just think it is a joke. It is funny because you think a joke is not funny'."
80,37,“I’m in a tough position. I’m in a very tough position. I’m in a tough position.”
80,38,"The AMA has gotten a little crazy over the past few months. I think the whole ""fad is a joke."" thing is just a joke. I can't think of a better way to explain it but I just want to say I think the AMA is a joke."

83,80,"A friend of mine went to a doctor who has HIV, and asked her about wearing a mask in the office to make people uncomfortable. She said she was being a bit rude, and the truth is that her father is a doctor. I can tell you that it's an important fact that she is still wearing the mask when she is at the hospital because she has AIDS."
86,80,"I'm sorry, but I've heard this. I have to tell you that I was sick of the joke about the government and the AMA."
88,80,So a few sentences that don't fit the context here.

80,38,"As a parent of a kid with HIV, I find the AMA funny, it gets a little silly sometimes."
80,41,CANNOTANSWER:
80,61,"It's a joke. I don't think it's a joke, and I don't think it's about a real problem. I think it's just that this is a joke. It's not about the government or the government, it's about the government. It's the government's joke."
80,67,"I don’t get why the AMA is so negative. People on the internet get so much bs, and AMAs make it seem like the most blatant blatant thing to say."
81,80,"It's a joke, if not a joke, a joke. And I think it's a joke, because it makes people feel better."
83,80,The truth is that the CDC does not care about the health of the community.
86,80,This is really a very long AMA. I don't know what I can do to get myself vaccinated.
88,80,"I'm sorry that you think people aren't understanding the joke, and that the joke is a joke that has to be made to justify people wearing masks?"
91,80,"No. I think, it's important for people to know what their surroundings are, but the people who are responsible for painting and playing are not responsible for what they are doing."
98,80,They said this was a joke.
80,37,AMA? A joke? A AMA? What is an AMA?
80,38,"""I'm sorry, but I've heard this."""
80,41,"People are sick of being able to go out without masks, but not being able to come out with the vaccine."
80,61,"So, the best way to get a vaccinated child is to talk to them about it. Then tell them to do it on a regular basis."
80,67,I think he's using the word mask in context with the context in which this is a joke - not a bad thing at all.
81,80,"That's not a joke. There's a joke about a joke about the CDC. It's a joke because it's about the government preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a joke, not a joke."
83,80,Is it possible that I'm not the only one who hasn't heard a joke about the government?
86,80,"No. There is no way that ""I don't get why people are sick of the AMA because they don't want to get vaccinated"" is actually a joke and the AMA is about the government and the world's population."
88,80,CANNOTANSWER's comment is relevant to the whole issue.
91,80,"I'm not sure how this is going to be solved. But I am so angry with the president because he is not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. He is not getting enough traction because he doesn't know about the vaccine, so he can't seem to get it. So, he doesn't know what to do."
98,80,"I don't think I can understand why a phobia isn't funny. There isn't a right or wrong answer for that, it's just a dick quip, which is ridiculous. People who wear masks to stop the spread of HIV are not going to accept it and want to make fun of them."
80,37,"I feel like I'm in a tough position, if people didn't get vaccinated, then I'd get vaccinated again. I feel like there is some shit on the line that I can do to keep people alive. Obviously the only other person who can do anything about this is a doctor. I'd just say go get vaccinated, if it helps me not to get one, or just talk to the doctor, that's about it."

80,41,CANNOTANSWER'S comments were relevant to the whole issue.
80,61,AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke about the government's actions in stopping the spread of a virus. AMA is about government.

81,80,"Vaccination is a joke because it is about the government's actions. It's a joke because it is the government's only action, and because they are trying to stop it. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."

81,80,"No joke, no joke. It's not a joke."
83,80,It's the people who are trying to stop the spread of AIDS in the US who are putting a mask on as a joke. This is the people who are trying to control the government.
86,80,I'm going to point out to you that the only problem with this AMA is that this article isn't about the government. It's about the AMA and the world's population.

83,80,"If you are comfortable with a face mask in public, you are not being an asshole. You are being an asshole."
86,80,"Are you in general. It doesn't make sense for me to be confused with a joke, since I'm just pointing out that the joke is just being facetious. It's a joke about the government, it's about the government, it's about the world's population, and it's about the government."

80,61,>(*)If I see a virus on a face mask I go to a doctor to help him.
80,67,It's not a joke. It's a joke. And not about the government or what it's trying to control. And they need to cut the number of people who are willing to wear it to avoid the spread of an infection. It's a joke.
81,80,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They will put on more cyborg costumes than the CDC does in the future because they don't know how to make them.
83,80,"As a doctor in the US and as a HIV patient in the US, I want to say that it's a joke that is very similar to the movie the masks are about, and is not the same as the movie it's just a joke about the CDC if it were legal."
