    "A mask mandate doesn't stop a virus from spreading, it helps prevent the spread. It prevents HIV from spreading. It's a joke. A mask mandate is a joke.",
    "Those are the two things I've always heard in the US.",
    "So you're saying that wearing a mask is just a joke, and you're saying you're a politician and that he is one? You're not a doctor and he is not a doctor but he is a politician. What's your favorite quote? Is this the same phrase we used in the same article?",
    "And that's a good one.",
    "The CDC and others are arguing that it's just a joke.",

    "No, I'm not an idiot. I am a politician who loves the CDC.",
    "It doesn't even seem to be a joke. It's a joke about the government not wanting to give people a mandate to wear a mask, but about getting them to wear a mask.",
    "In that movie, the government is not a joke, it is an idea of a joke. It's about putting a mask on and not wearing a mask on to prevent people from getting infected.",
    "I've been to the worst CDC, and I wear it everyday, but sometimes I don't feel like it's funny because I've tried to help. When people are sick I use the mask, because it's not really nice for me. My job is to prevent infection, which isn't a joke. I'm wearing a mask to prevent it from spreading, and for some reason, if I do, I'll be able to be on the sideline as needed to stay in control of my health. It's not a joke. It's",
