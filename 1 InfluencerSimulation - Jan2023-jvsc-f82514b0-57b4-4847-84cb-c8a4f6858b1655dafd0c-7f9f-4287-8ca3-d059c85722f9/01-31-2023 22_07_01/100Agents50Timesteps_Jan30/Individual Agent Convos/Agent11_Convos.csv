22,11,wear a mask and bend over really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask
24,11,Hey there! I am walking in the grocery store!
29,11,Well I wore a mask when my daughter was pregnant and she was born in a different state in Australia that was not in the US. The reason I wear it is to not be outside on hot days or cold weather. It s comfortable in the winter and I was never vaccinated for it.
38,11,My brother and I are in FL now. We both wear masks when we aren't going out.
40,11,"I'm curious as to what the rule is in this country, but is it based on the law of the land or a state? Or any other governmental regulation?"
48,11,...and when i was a kid i was always wearing masks and i wore a mask in the sun because i was sick and i was going to have to have a helmet for the drive up test
50,11,People have a right to not wear a mask and that should be a moral compass of the government.
52,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,11,I don't believe they have any protection at all.
73,11,"I don't agree with that position at all. i'm from texas and i don't think they will follow the law, but I think they will and this is a good example of how government is being too harsh."

98,11,I love wearing a mask to work at a tv show.
11,2,The laws in Texas have nothing to do with whether or not a doctor or medical professional wears them.
11,5,"I'm afraid this isn't very clear. There are very strong groups of people who are willing to work with the government. It's not like a group of people are willing to do the 'right thing', but instead are going to just throw on an excuse to get sick."
11,6,"In the USA it's a federal issue, and it's definitely not legal to wear a mask for a reason other than not being vaccinated."
11,7,So what would the law be like in Mexico where you can't wear a mask or take an emergency pill?
11,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,11,"People can get vaccinated in small numbers. In fact, there are a number of vaccines to combat a Virus."
19,11,"You don't need a mask to protect from a virus. A lot of people would not be comfortable putting on a mask and have a fever if they didn't have a mask. A more logical explanation is that the government is taking the vaccines and vaccines, and they're not putting on any kind of kind of protection against the spread of the virus. That's why a lot of people wear a mask."
22,11,"That is such an awesome post. I read it a couple years back and have always assumed it was about being vaccinated as an infant. I don't believe that it is just some kind of fear, or ignorance. I'm just going to say it again: if I'm on my own and I think I have enough awareness of the dangers of public health, I may not wear it in public. I've never seen it before."
24,11,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. And I get to go with you. I am so glad that the gov't has stepped up to help stop the spread of a virus.took my first flight in months for a work trip everyone wore a mask everyone was respectful of other people reminds you not all people suck most but not all can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
29,11,"i want to say that this isn't a cynical idea, but rather an unfortunate result of a sham."
38,11,A mask helps stop the spread of a virus.

48,11,santa needs to wear a mask because he has the right to wear it.
50,11,People have a right to not wear a mask and that should be a moral compass of the government. You gotta wear a mask and be a good person Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You've been doing a good job of saying you wore a mask and be a good person Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,11,This is something I think I would rather hear. But I think it should be an issue of privacy.
55,11,"In our country, people are always on the offensive. In fact, this was the last time the government ever had to issue a masked or dummy in our parks. We have a very specific policy on the act of masked masked."
73,11,>We must change our constitution to stop the spreading of the virus.
83,11,"It is important to keep people safe by being able to stay safe and not wearing masks - it is important to protect yourself when it comes to getting sick. If the vaccine wasn't effective, I'd get it, but my local public health department will be there."
98,11,What would you wear if you didn't know about the vaccine.
11,2,>We must change our constitution to stop the spread of the virus.
11,5,"Unless there is some very strict government regulation that strays from this, it's not very clear. It's a state issue, but it's definitely not legal."
11,6,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
11,7,Vaccination is a mandated vaccine of the US government. This would not be the first time the US has issued a mask.
11,9,There are actually a couple things that I believe are a good reason not to wear masks.
14,11,"There's a link at the top of this r/reddit article called ""Gods will not care."" It's also in the title."
19,11,>There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines.
22,11,">They can't just blame them for their wrongdoing or for being wrong. I'm just going to try to explain to my kids to wear a mask. There is no need for you to wear a mask. You wear it at least three times in a month. You need to wear yours more often. They don't do that because they're in fear of their public health, which they're doing with people like you, I don't see why a government agency would do it if a snoop dog was going to go to party or something"
24,11,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
29,11,I've been doing this. What I did was an honest conversation about it.
38,11,"Yes, wearing a mask in public can help stop the spread of a virus. But a mask and some masks are needed to stop it. The federal government does not have any laws against this so it's kind of a fucking bad idea to wear a mask. Especially when you're getting an infection."
40,11,"...but not in an open place, and not in a public place."
48,11,'We need a mask'
50,11,It's not a mandate that you are required to wear a mask and a helmet to protect you from a virus.
52,11,I don't think they are doing anything about that - the issue is that people in these situations can't be protected.
55,11,"I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,11,The government isn't going to change anything about the health care system or the state. This is a big issue.
83,11,"...but we're just doing it all because you're a human being. I'm not sure if this is true in all countries, or any of them."
98,11,There's a certain amount of stigma surrounding it that would keep people from wearing it unless it's a joke.
11,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,5,"If the US government is going to have to take a long time to change the constitution to stop the spread of the virus, and if there's no such regulation, it's not legally a bad idea."
11,6,Vaccination is not a mandatory vaccination.
11,7,This is just a little confusing.
11,9,It's not a law in every country. Its a law.
14,11,"In my town, there's a group of homeless and homeless people with a hood and a mask that they can wear to stop HIV/AIDS. There's some pretty common ones as well."
19,11,We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from Covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated we keep hearing about how most Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
22,11,"i had an old friend that was sick and his mother swore he wasn't aware that the doctor was putting it on him to help him get out of bed and had the sex to try to get her off the street (with an old man's mask). He thought he was a panda and the doctor said, hey, that's a mask. i went. he cried. i was in the hospital with a lot of sick people and was in hospital for a week and he was the only doctor i needed to"
24,11,I am just a bit of a vaccinatarian in a slightly different field. I don't see what 'everyone' would want to wear a mask if they were not doing it.
29,11,>Isn't wearing a mask an official part of the Government's policy to prevent the spread of a virus?
38,11,"Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile and you are not going to stop the spread of a virus. It's a red flag for the government."
40,11,CDC made a policy to make it illegal to wear a mask in the Halloween parade.
48,11,It would be kind of weird for me to say that but I am not sure what it is.
50,11,What is the meaning of 'Making a mask and a helmet to protect you from a virus'? It's not part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,11,"In California, putting a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
55,11,"People wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face. I see no reason why I want to wear a mask. People don't need a mask to get sick, so they can use a mask to rehydrate the face."
73,11,"That's what the big issue is. You like the guy, but you don't want to change your life. You don't want to change your life."
83,11,"...but we're just doing it all because you're a human being. I know what you mean! I am a huge fan of wearing a mask in public. I have a medical history that I can relate to: ""I have to clean my hands every day from a day to day basis. I do not care for my body. I don't care about my family and I have to help my wife. I do not care about his mother's health. I care about the best interests of my children."""
98,11,I've gotten sick of wearing masks all the time and they don't stop me from wearing one! I don't like it at all. It's just a big part of my apnea.
11,2,I read an article in another sub called [http://www.etsy.com/blog/sci/comments/cssic/news/research/2007/05/research/iraq/docs_reflection/article_in-depth_on_it_as_in-depth_program//apnea_embarrassment_reflection/en-apnea_suggestions_for_t
11,5,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, but it is a great topic and a great point to bring up."
11,6,This is also what I get from a guy in the 80s who wore a hat and a mask all the time to keep his kids safe.
11,7,"You are going to get the right message, but a lot of people don't understand the basic idea of a mask and are confused. I don't get the whole message, and this is an important one. I don't want to get into a heated debate, but I do want to help people understand that they do a lot of important, important things in life."
11,9,I'm not a lawyer. It's just how it is.
14,11,"Honestly, I think I read some stuff a bit and I'm going to omit some of the points you made."
19,11,"Yes I'd get vaccinated, too. It's not a joke."
22,11,Why is it that a government agency that has a rule that requires people to wear a mask when they are sick isn't one of the many things they're a part of?
24,11,Then you're just a bit of a vaccarian in a slightly different field.
29,11,It's a joke. It's a joke.
38,11,afaik I just read the comments in r/AwfulAddiction.
40,11,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
48,11,What do you think is weird?
50,11,You don't need a mask and a helmet. And the government doesn't have any control over what it's doing.
52,11,i don't think they are doing anything about that - the issue is that people in these situations can't be protected
55,11,You're not a dangerous person and deserve a proper doctor. Yes it is. We have to keep it real.
73,11,This guy is a man. He is a dangerous person. I don't understand how he is claiming to have a statewide mask mandate.
83,11,"I think people who want to protect themselves are not allowed to wear a mask on the job, because it's the most important thing to protect themselves from spreading a virus."
98,11,I was a big fan of masks. A few times I felt a little uncomfortable wearing them.
11,2,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I've gotten sick of wearing masks all the time and they don't stop me from wearing one! I don't like it at all. It's just a big part of my apnea. I read an article in another sub called [http://www.etsy.com/blog/sci/comments/cssic/news/
11,5,Nope. Just a bunch of jokes. I've been in a lot of situations where wearing a mask on a job is a big deal.
11,6,>Then you're just a bit of a vaccarian in a slightly different field.
11,7,Is there a government agency in the US that is not implementing it? No.
11,9,"I think if you want to protect yourself you can use a helmet in tight environments. You're not a law, so I'm gonna say it's a good idea."
14,11,"Well, the headlines are not about a single story, but there's one in particular, where it's a really big deal."
19,11,"They don't seem to think so. It's a shit joke. Whether they're making it a joke or not, they seem like they think people should be able to do what they want in terms of a ""freemask"". I like the fact that they're using a bunch of ""false science"" to make a movie about the 'defiantly' infected, which is just as bad as the AMA."
22,11,"I think it's quite a joke, in my opinion. I'm not going to say that's a good thing, but it's also a great idea for people to do it when they're sick."
24,11,>I don't really see what 'everyone' would want to wear a mask if they were not doing it.
29,11,There are so many people who get sick of doing this. But they are also not immune to the virus.
38,11,It's an amazing thing that the government doesn't have a law against it.
40,11,You are asking yourself a question:
48,11,Is there anything you can say to them? Do they imply they are weird or that they are just a joke? Or are you just assuming they do it because they don't think they are weird? Is there anything you can do to explain the reason for wearing a mask?
50,11,A mask is a medical device.
52,11,"It's a funny quote that goes along with this. ""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. If you're a doctor you don't want to vaccinate everyone. If a doctor doesn't want you to wear a mask they aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They don't think that you're vile."""

73,11,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Is wearing a mask in this post a problem of 'government incompetence' in Texas?
83,11,People are not allowed to wear a mask on a job.
98,11,"I've been wearing a mask all my life. They're fun, but it doesn't keep you warm. I'm sure it makes sense, but not everyone would want to wear a mask."
11,2,"''We've been doing the same thing in the USA and I think it's good that we can help with this problem. I'm sure ''There is a huge problem here in the U.S.'', 'The laws in Texas have nothing to do with whether or not a doctor or medical professional wears them.''', ''We must change our constitution to stop the spread of the virus.''', ''We must change our constitution to stop the spread of the virus.'"
11,5,"So, I'm gonna just say if I'm going to wear a mask on a job, I'm going to wear a mask on a job? If not, a dummy mask wouldn't help."
11,6,"If I'm not sick, I'm not a superhero. I'm not a superhero."
11,7,alot of people don't understand the basic idea of a mask.
11,9,You don't really have any reason to wear a mask.
14,11,"It seems like the NSA is not trying to get something for it, but is more concerned with the safety of the vaccines and its use for being an innocent joke, like I've said before."
19,11,"Its been about the same for about 5 years now. Mostly in the media around here. This is the only reason I haven't seen this movie in over a decade. It's kinda ridiculous, but I do have a point. The AMA doesn't seem to be a good place to start."
22,11,"You're not getting my sarcasm, you're not getting my real sarcasm."
24,11,I do it as a joke. And I do it while we're at the party level. It is the best kind of joke.
29,11,"It’s a joke. It’s a joke. If it was to stop the spread of a virus, I'd say the joke is just a joke."
38,11,"> Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile and you are not going to stop the spread of a virus. It's a red flag for the government."
40,11,I just want to see if there's a movie about a guy who's trying to make vaccines illegal in the halloween parade and why he's not a pedophile?
48,11,[Making a joke about a fad exists. A prank exists because there is no way to prevent that.
50,11,I think you're being kind of jaded.
52,11,What do you want to hear about the CDC in this video?
55,11,"...[We have a very specific policy on the act of masked masked.](http://www.nasa.gov/en/index.html?p=3867/),"
73,11,"It is important to note that I did not see that one of the federal mandates that he put on was in place. I know you do not read it, but I have to say this is pretty much the point of this subreddit."
83,11,"And it is a joke, you're being a bit sexist. And I mean, I don't want a movie or fable to tell a joke, but I would wear a mask. Especially since it's so bad that people like to make fun of people on the run. Then again, it's the joke, so a little funny, but not the best."
98,11,"You are being very rude, and you can't take constructive criticism."
11,2,"As an American, I don't understand why a lot of people who hate the act of pretending to be a pedophile, or other religious or governmental leaders would even try to use it to make fun of a pedophile."
11,5,"Well, I just want to get my point across, but I am in fact very upset about something you said in the post."
11,6,"As a parent, you could say: ""The CDC will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of the people on the trail."
11,7,"Generally, the answer is that you don't want to be a pedophile and you are not going to stop the spread of a virus. It's a red flag for the government."
11,9,"If you were in the medical profession that you would be wearing a mask that was a prank and I would say a joke about a pedophile is an awful joke. I'd recommend a movie about a pedophile that is prank, albeit only a joke."
14,11,"I am not saying that you are not being silly. I am saying that the issue with the statewide mask mandate is a joke. I don't believe the AMA is about how much people want to wear masks in order to prevent people from getting HIV, and that the government doesn't have any say in what their vaccines will do."
19,11,"""I wear a mask to stop people from fapping me while in my mask."""
22,11,"As a doctor, I would recommend putting on a mask and not having to see a doctor who hasn't had a doctor's assistant before. He knows it is an ineffective treatment for a virulent disease and won't actually go to the doctor if there is a virus that will spread."
24,11,"The worst part is that most people don't realize how stupid this is to start trying to get rid of a horrible, anti-virus shaming tactic. This is an example of a symptom of the US, and a common problem."
29,11,I think it's the right word. It's also pretty funny because you can easily find the meaning behind it when you see a kid. The joke is 'I'm just talking about my life and I'm just talking about my health'.
38,11,"""We all need to wear masks when we'ren't going out."""
40,11,It's a joke. It's just a joke.
48,11,Vaccines are not illegal. And they aren’t required.
50,11,"I'm not the one whose parents are trying to use a mask or one of those masks, I'm just trying to understand that they're the ones who are being jaded."
52,11,I don't know anything about the CDC's policies and strategies. If they did a mask on me I would have gotten sick. I'd not be able to go to the hospital because that's what you want to hear. If they didn't I would just not go to the doctor because I would be worried.
55,11,"In my school, my parents had a girl who would wear a mask at school. My parents had a friend who would wear a mask when she was sick. My grandparents knew about it, and said that she would never be able to get her vaccine. I told her about it all the time. She did not realize the truth of it, but she didn't think it was a joke."
73,11,I don't really think they should change anything about the health care system or the state.
83,11,"Vaccines are not required. They aren't. But it's legal. People who wear a mask are just trying to be nice, it's called an ""old joke."" But it's not. But it's illegal. They are not. But it's legal. People who wear a mask are just trying to be nice, it's called an ""old joke."" But it's not. It's illegal. Vaccines are not."
98,11,It seems that in this context I'm not getting a clue what is going on. In the sense that you're saying he is trying to make fun of the joke.
11,2,"My apnea is a sign that I have an AIDS virus. I'm not sure how long the CDC's mandate has been aimed at reducing AIDS outbreaks, but the fact that a lot of people are talking about it because of the fact that the CDC has been doing that to help the epidemic is indicative of the fact that we have to be extremely careful."
11,5,I don't see where this has anything to do with the law of vaccinations. I think it is just a joke.
11,6,"So, how can the CDC do what it takes to prevent spread of HIV in the US?"
11,7,"I don't know how it was a joke, but I can definitely understand how people would get mad that they wore a mask. It sounds like the government would be doing something in the name of protecting themselves and getting out of there. Isn't it nice that they are willing to pay for the doctor's assistant?"
11,9,"You're trying to get rid of a symptom of the US, and a common problem."
14,11,You think you’re being ridiculous? Well a lot of folks think so.
19,11,"In order to make that AMA funny, I'm going to be honest with you. There are a ton of people in my group that are just as afraid of the possibility of HIV spread as the AMA, even though they all think that the government is trying to help with HIV."
22,11,I think the government has to provide more protective masks for the public who are injected or infected.
24,11,I think this guy is trying to make a joke about the problem that is already there. But you've gotta look it up and see how it goes.
29,11,"A 'porn-porn' is a joke, not a joke."
38,11,"It's not really a joke, it's just that people use a lot of words in their post to yell at the government, and it's a bad idea."
40,11,"[Personspying is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Having said that, I do like to think the NSA has done some serious work to stop the spread of a virus."
48,11,"I'm sorry but it's the only place I've read a lot about this. I don't have a job and a lot of the CDC isn't interested in bringing this up. If they don't have any, I'd be pretty confused."

52,11,"It isn't just a joke, it's about health."
55,11,"""Man in the Hat"" is the one a lot of people have heard before. The joke is about people with a mask and a hat, but it's not about them sneezing. It's about the government promoting people to do it."
73,11,The issue is the people who don't think the government is incompetent. The people who do think the government is incompetent are people who don't know what to do.

11,6,Why doesn't the CDC have an agency to prevent AIDS in the first place? Vaccination is an insurance policy and a public health policy.

40,11,"It's a joke, but it's not going to make people laugh, and it is a joke to fuck with people, and it is a joke to not be funny."
48,11,"AMA : You don't like it and don't like it, but you don't like the idea of a joke involving a government."
50,11,"> It’s funny that the vaccines that come out of the mouth are all about the people whose lives are endangered by the virus, which is part of the reason for the deaths of 200,000 people worldwide."
52,11,"""I just read this book and I thought I would go to the doctor. I guess I wouldn't be able to go to the doctor because that's what I wanted to hear. If they didn't do that I wouldn't be able to go to the doctor."""
55,11,"I think you're being facetious about the fact that you think that the real issue is sneezing, not making jokes about it."
73,11,He's not saying they have to change anything about the health care system or state. He's talking about how they need to change the mask to stop the spread of the virus.
83,11,"People need a job. The government is working in their best interest. Vaccines are not legally required in many countries, but not in most."
98,11,> I don't like wearing a mask at all.
11,2,The article is about the AMA's effect on the population of Texas.
11,5,So why did the AMA become a joke?
11,6,"I'm a teacher, so I'm not sure what this is about."
11,7,The AMA is a joke. But the AMA doesn't even mean a joke. They are merely a joke.
11,9,I'm gonna go get a full-blown AMA.
14,11,"I think the AMA is more about how the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV, than anything else."
19,11,I just started the movie because I have no idea why the movie has got so much media coverage.

29,11,"The joke is not about the health of a person or his wife or any person, it's about the actual health of the person or their families or the government itself or it's a joke. There is a point that if the government is trying to stop people from getting sick of it, it's a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The AMA is about stopping the spread of a virus. The government is trying to stop it from being harmful to them, but it isn't an excuse for you to do it."
38,11,"> We all need to wear masks when we aren't going out."", ""I know that many people here, but you have been doing the wrong thing for years."
40,11,"I think there is a bit of a common theme here that it is a joke about the CDC. If the CDC is using a joke about AIDS to stop people from getting infected, maybe they can do something about that?"
48,11,I'd like to say that the AMAs aren't jokes. They're AMAs. They are AMAs. They're AMAs. They're jokes.
50,11,"The joke is that the government is trying to make people laugh. It's not about the government, it's about the government."

83,11,"This is a good one. It seems that a lot of people think the CDC is not required to provide a mandate and don't know how to do it. So, this is a joke."

11,9,The AMA is about the government and that is a joke.
14,11,"So the article says the NSA is going to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS, but they're not going to let people get vaccinated. That's an argument they're proving, in the long run. The AMA isn't about whether the mask mandate is a joke or a joke. It's more about whether or not the government has a mandate to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, and how people want to do something about it."
19,11,The jokes are about how we can be confident and that they should be made.
22,11,"The government will not protect people and prevent infections, so they are going to have to make the government take precautions to prevent it."

24,11,I don't know who they are referring to here. I've read an article that's kinda boring and just a little confusing and it isn't the best one. I also've heard the AMA is really a joke and the AMA just seems like a bad joke.
29,11,"I feel as if it's a joke and you need to make up a story and explain that the AMA is intended to make people feel better. It's not going to stop the spread of AIDS. But the AMA is a joke, isn't it?"
38,11,"I think there is a lot of stuff going on here about the AMA about vaccines, but it's not just a joke. It's a joke about the government and the CDC. There is a lot of people involved in AMAs about vaccines."
40,11,"i'm not a doctor, I'm not a doctor."
48,11,"AMA's are funny because they're a way to get people to think that the AMA is a joke. I don't think there's any real difference between the two. AMAs are a way to try and make people think that the AMA is about the government. There's a lot of disagreement here about why the film is a joke, not whether or not a clone is a joke."
50,11,I'd say the whole point of the article is that the whole issue isn't made up in my head.
52,11,"The joke is only a joke, not an arbitrary gimmick."
55,11,"This is not a joke,''I don't believe they have any protection at all. The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a threat to the safety of others. ''There's only one joke"

83,11,"Is the idea that you can do it in public? If so, you need to reread what's in the book and the reasons why it's funny."

11,9,Why is it not a joke?
14,11,"Yes. The AMA hasn't been a joke, and the AMA is just about the administration trying to make a joke about it."
19,11,It's a joke for people who don't want to be in a situation where they don't have a health care provider.
22,11,The AMA was an attempt to show that 'we're in danger'. That's why we're here. You're a good doctor. You're not an expert on vaccinating. But you're not getting your point across.
24,11,"I am not a lawyer. I am just a lot of friends. I don't know any of these people. I can't speak for everybody. The AMA is funny, despite the lack of a joke. Is there any 'bad joke' about the AMA?"
29,11,"Yes, that joke is about the government. It's not just the government, it's a prank and a joke."
38,11,"What do you mean ""the government is trying to rip off the government""?"
40,11,That's a joke.
48,11,"As a fellow CDC participant, I agree with [Kim]. The government is trying to stop the spread of the AIDS virus. A lot of people are sick of that."

22,11,It isn’t a joke.
24,11,"It is funny, despite the lack of a joke."
29,11,It's a joke. It's not about the government. It's about the AMA and the vaccines. It isn't about the vaccines and the vaccines are for life.
38,11,"You're thinking of a book about a lot of diseases that are related to HIV, and are a ripoff of it. It's essentially about the AMA about a vaccine marketed by the CDC. It's about how a lot of doctors and med students are using vaccines to spread HIV, to scare people. It's about preventing a lot of diseases, and it's essentially about the vaccines marketed by the CDC."
40,11,It is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
48,11,"I would say, for a moment, it is a joke about a clone, not the government."
50,11,You're being jaded? I'm just trying to understand that they're the ones who are being jaded.
