41,4,I want a story of someone that is trying to use the word'superspreader' for a joke.
44,4,You don't know how to get a lot of ctl in your face if you just have to walk a block away.
77,4,We know it is possible to make a drool over in a hospital or in a public hospital.
82,4,"i like wearing the mask, the ones with the face mask, the ones with the hair mask etc, and that kind of stuff is very fun and interesting"

6,4,I agree with the person above you that it's important to get it in place. I think it's also important to understand the importance of protecting yourself when you're doing the work. I just want to add this.
9,4,> I think the whole point of wearing a mask is to protect yourself from the ailment that comes with it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,4,"You're supposed to wear a mask to protect yourself and others in the public health field, not just from the government. The laws are for a wide variety of reasons. Do you think people who are vaccinated shouldn't wear a mask? Because it could be just as dangerous as you'd think."
34,4,It says that it will cost the government millions to keep a mask on and prevent the spread of the virus.
37,4,I ain't trying to make it sound like that's the problem.
41,4,"People use the word ""superspreader"" for a joke."
44,4,"I'm going to try to put my face in a face mask, I'll wear it and I'll never get it."
77,4,[Third World Medicine](https://www.themedical.gov/thirty-thirty-thousand-the-people-who-have-a-right-to-not-wear-a-masked-as-a-masked-as-a-medicator) has a post-addiction policy governing wearing masks.
82,4,I was going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. They’re saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it. I just don’t understand.
98,4,"I don't have any advice on how to get into a healthy diet, but I feel it's a good idea to exercise daily if possible to prevent this and that will prevent it from spread to other people. Wearing a mask to help prevent spread is a good idea, but when you're already wearing it, it won't get rid of it."
6,4,"This is the part of the government that is trying to make you think, don't you?"
9,4,"I’m wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don’t see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."
23,4,I am more confused than it sounds.
34,4,"I've never seen a guy with a mask wearing a virus, and i've seen people who do this. And it sounds like you are using a joke, not saying that it isn't a joke."
37,4,... I'm interested in seeing what we can do to reduce the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,4,> I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated
44,4,I read somewhere that OP has been vaccinated but isn't sure about this.
77,4,"> When would you wear a mask to keep a sick person safe? Unless you're sick for a bit, you can't use a mask, because you don't trust the government. You have no respect for the citizens of the state. You don't trust the vaccine. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'Put your helmet on to a window or doorway if you have an emergency. I would say 'Cause I have an emergency'"
82,4,"I’d say it’s not a bad idea. I do not think that they are trying to help people get a better cure for their illness, but it will help. Is it possible for people not to be infected with HIV to be infected with it?"
98,4,That's an interesting take on a joke.
6,4,"I don't think you have read the wiki article and don't understand the concept of a health issue. Having a mask does not help to prevent a pandemic or from spreading it. But you are completely right that a mask is a critical part of protecting yourself and protecting yourself from the spread of the virus. I just think that the government is the only thing capable of doing something to prevent that. I am sick of seeing people doing feces of feces with their own hair, I am ashamed, I believe that wearing a mask is a factor in"
9,4,"i'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."
23,4,I think it is also dangerous that the man was still alive and still had a family of his own.
34,4,And I'm gonna tell you to go back to the internet to ask a question...
37,4,So this guy is really just going around the 'right' side.
41,4,I don't think it's wrong to wear a mask when you're sick. It's just a way to get away from the public and help people in an emergency.
44,4,"Vaccination is not a cure for HIV/AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
77,4,"I can't imagine that a vaccinated person would need to wear a mask for any medical emergency, or any other reason, unless you have a medical emergency. Unless your medical issue would be a flu or something, then I'd say that they can't do anything about it without the vaccinated person having some kind of emergency."
82,4,I think this would be the most appropriate answer.
98,4,"As someone who has been on public meds I'd like to tell you to take the precaution that people are wearing a mask. If that doesn't work, I would just let them go with their meds."
6,4,Vaccines and protective clothing have very different uses that you would find in any other harmed environment. You don't need a mask to protect your face from being taken out by a virus unless you are wearing a mask.
9,4,Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,4,I'm so sorry this happened to you.
34,4,I'm in a similar situation.
37,4,Unless there's a way to circumvent the government's control of the world.
41,4,"It is a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated. In my experience you don't have to wear a mask to make you sick."
44,4,This is a very well known topic that's a joke.
77,4,"I am not even sure what you're getting at. As someone with an AIDS virus, I can say that wearing a mask is one thing, but the other is another. I am in my 30s, and my mom is very well aware of how common an infection is - I can go to the hospital and try a few times - and I just can't believe it's a virus. I also get very sick from people doing things they don't want to do, so it's good to keep a 'viremia' to be done. It's "
82,4,So... he's saying the government isn't helping?
98,4,"""The most common reason you are wearing a mask is because your facial expression is too thin. They say it because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it. You have to wear it for your face. It makes you feel like you're a part of something. If you wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, then you can only wear one."
6,4,"That's a funny joke, it's what I read in a few other places. It's kind of funny but kind of scary when you're a kid."
9,4,What is the reason I don't have time to shave my face stubble in the morning?
23,4,AIDS is a horrible disease. You shouldn't have gotten a vaccination unless you are sick and have a family of your own.
34,4,"[NAME]: We are the government, and all of our citizens."
37,4,I think he's thinking of doing a mask when the health care system isn't working. That's the point. It would be better for the government to have you go to the doctor and see if there's anything you can do to stop the spread of the disease.
41,4,This is a great way to explain a situation where you need to be able to go out in public and talk to people if you want.
44,4,I can imagine the horrors of seeing that face in a mask is a bit in my head. I wouldn't wear a mask and feel bad about seeing someone in a mask.
77,4,"Until I've been told this, I've been a nurse for the last 10 years, and I've only ever seen some of my friends or family be vaccinated."
82,4,The government does not want to do the work that's going on.
98,4,"It sounds like a joke and that makes you feel good about it, but they're making fun of it. So..."
6,4,"Vaccination is a problem, because it isn't a fad. You're wearing a mask? Are you wearing it? Are you not afraid? Vaccines are the easiest and cheapest choice."
9,4,I have to say I really enjoy the fuck out of this
23,4,There's a link on the wiki page on the government that gives people information about how to protect themselves from illness. They do not 'know' what a virus is and how to stop it from spread.
34,4,I have a mask and I don't think it would be possible for me to wear a mask for work...
37,4,"IANAL, but it seems like this guy is a phony, a slob of the gov't. He's trying to tamper with the reality, and there's no real evidence that he's making an attempt to stop it."
41,4,A doctor can wear a mask but not when he or she is sick and sick. As long as it is worn well it won't be in his favor.
44,4,"Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
77,4,>The only thing preventing people from getting a virus is preventing them from getting ebola.
82,4,What's the most appropriate answer?
98,4,"I don't think you're being funny. This is like being a joke. I've never heard anyone say ""Waring a mask."" It's not a joke, but it's part of a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
6,4,"""It's a joke, because it's a joke, because it's a joke."""
9,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,4,What? Vaccines are a ripoff and it's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
34,4,It's not funny at all....because it's not really funny at all.
37,4,"The guy has an agenda and needs to take action. A person's innate desire to change their own world will help him to change it. The CDC will then give him a chance to go after you. If he's making a decision about something, he'll probably stop a change of course."
41,4,"""I'm wearing a mask but not when I'm sick. It's just a way to get away from the public and help people in an emergency."""
44,4,"If I had a child who had the Vaccination Campaign, I'd wear a mask and a face mask."
77,4,"This is just one of those times where a physician would have to explain to a patient to the patient ""I can't believe that a vaccinated person would need to wear a mask for any medical emergency, or any other reason"" that he wasn't aware of and I'm a big anti ebola fanatic."
82,4,Why do you say I'm a doctor because I can say it's good for protecting people?
98,4,It's a joke and it's a joke.
6,4,It's a joke to be honest with you but is actually a joke to be true. This is not a joke.

98,4,It seems to me that the humor of a mask isn't a joke. People want to be so stupid it's worth a laugh. I think you've got the right idea here.
6,4,You were an American student. There are a lot of problems on this subreddit with the government. The fact that there are people who say they are sick is a problem.
9,4,The main point is to remind you that your afra is a joke. It is not about it. It is about how afra does not care about protecting others from AIDS. It's not about that.
23,4,"Vaccines are just a joke, and they are dangerous. It's not a joke and the CDC doesn't need to stop the spread of AIDS."
34,4,The NSA is not a government agency. The U.S. government is a public entity that allows government personnel to wear a mask. It is not one of its official duties.
37,4,">Hey, it sounds like a great idea to me. It's like a funny joke: they don't care if you get sick because you don't know what's going on. And if they don't, they don't know what to do. Especially if you know that they're sick. 'The government is not trying to prevent the spread of a virus."
41,4,A bit of a BS to say this but that's what the AMA is about.

82,4,"I'm going to take a guess, but here's a little piece of info. AMAs are a gimmick for people, not to mention you’re being a joke."
98,4,So here is why I don't understand why there are people on this sub.
6,4,I think you should consider wearing a mask as part of being safe.
9,4,I have a friend that tries to joke about how he doesn't like wearing a mask. He likes wearing a mask but I don't think he likes the idea. He's a jerk
23,4,"The problem with vaccination is not the government, but the people whose right to get sick has been the CDC. This is not a joke."
34,4,You need to hear the joke. You don't need to hear it.
37,4,"[NAME] is a CDC member and has a very strong position against using a mask. The government is trying to make that claim illegal, but it’s going to go into effect, which presumably won’t be a joke."
41,4,"I agree with you 100%. I'm not saying it's wrong but I would consider it to be a joke. The AMA is an acronym for a non-confrontational joke. And the one you mentioned does seem like a joke to me, which is to say that the AMA was about a joke."
44,4,So much for this AMA. I don't really think it's a joke or a ripoff. I'd be surprised if I had the courage to put myself out there and do it if I could.
77,4,"As a doctor in the military, I'd be worried about the people who get infected if they aren't vaccinated."
82,4,There's no reason for AMAs to be a joke. I want the government to keep in mind that the CDC is helping people prevent infections. You are the one who made the jokes.
98,4,"I don't see how the whole ""waring a mask"" thing is really funny, it just has so many sexist jokes. I mean, a lot of them aren't just a joke, they're just jokes about people being in a situation to get a joke out of them and they're trying to justify that, but they're not the only ones who see this as a joke."
6,4,">Mom is my favorite part. I've always wondered what that would do to me in the past. But I don't really know why that's a joke. I've always wanted to get vaccinated, and the CDC is really trying to make me think that's a joke."
9,4,"I'm an American, I remember how people said I didn't like wearing a mask because I was sick. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed. I remember how people said that it was the best way to stop a virus, but I didn't know how it was a joke."
23,4,"The government is putting a lot of time and effort into preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and that's not being a joke."
34,4,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to stop the spread of a virus. What's the point of wearing a mask in front of a TV in a movie if you know how to use it?
37,4,">Hey, it sounds like a great idea to me.''"
41,4,"They're just a joke, right?"

23,4,"A lot of these people are hating on the government, but it's only a joke because it's not about the government."
34,4,"A few things to consider. Its not funny at all, it's a joke."
37,4,"The CDC does have the capability to prevent people from getting a vaccination. They want to protect the public, but that doesn't mean that they need to change the government. I'm not sure what they're asking about /r/cannotheal/, but I'm not sure they're looking at the CDC's situation."
41,4,"They're not a joke, just an acronym, and the AMA is about the AMA, not about the government trying to push a vaccine issue. The AMA is about a joke about the government trying to fix AIDS, but the CDC doesn't want to make them illegal."
44,4,> a lot of jokes are about the NSA.
77,4,I don't have a problem with the masks. I have an issue with how they work despite what some people tell them. I don't think the government should be letting the CDC enforce any laws about it.
82,4,It seems the people who make jokes are very knowledgeable.
98,4,"There is a lot of confusion between how people look and how people act, and the actual reason why people act."
6,4,Vaccines are for life. It's a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke.

37,4,"If you don't think that a CDC member is an actual CDC member or an advocate of HIV prevention in any country in the world you shouldn't feel at all guilty about using a mask unless it has some sort of medical benefit. I would have to agree with you if you're not on the right side of a joke - a medical professional, doctor, or a doctor. Then the fact that he is an AIDS expert will be a real dealbreaker for him. I'm not a CDC member - the CDC member"
41,4,Because the AMA isn't actually about a joke. It's about the AMA.
44,4,I would be really uncomfortable if I were in the adolescent med student world.
77,4,"In your post about AIDS/Mucus, people don't wear the masks. You don't want to be a doctor, but you want to be a doctor."
82,4,"Well, unless you're saying the government isn't incompetent, I think AMAs are a joke."

6,4,"I hate to hear this, but I like it because it is a joke."
9,4,I didn't know that there was an AMA on roelandreddit.
23,4,It's a joke about the government.
34,4,Why would the CDC be allowed to wear the mask?
37,4,I think this is just a good idea to put it on and see if it works - I'm sure you won't like it.
41,4,Isn't the entire point of this article about the AMA really about the AMA and its not about the vaccine issue?
44,4,I just finished reading the article and it is very well known. It's a joke. I didn't get the reference to the AMA but I did read the headline. I'm not going to believe it or make an AMA. And if you're a med student here I'm not really sure you're being jaded.
77,4,The AMA is not about the government. They are about the people. They are not the government. It is a joke.
82,4,"So, this is a good AMA. You need to talk to your doctor about it. I'm sorry that you're being a joke."
98,4,I think the most common reason that people are wearing a mask for fear of getting sick is because it makes them uncomfortable and to show them that they like the person or thing they like wearing a mask.

82,4,"What they are doing is really silly and silly. It isn't something they want to do, but it's funny."
98,4,"I think the joke has a lot to do with how everyone is feeling, how the people who wear a mask can feel uncomfortable, the amount of attention and a lack of awareness on the subject."
6,4,"In my opinion, this is the best part of being a doctor."
9,4,...I was very young and shaved my face to be sure it didn't get cold....
23,4,I don't think it is a joke that the government is trying to make a joke about AIDS or that the CDC is slandering people for it.
34,4,"I'm a nurse, and I wear a mask and I don't think it's funny. If you think it's funny you need to find out what it is about. If it's not a joke, then there is a pretty big problem with the ad."

6,4,"Vaccines are not a joke. They are something that is useful and is a necessary part of a health care system. But, not all of these things are a joke."
9,4,"I don't get why this is funny, but you know how the author is referencing the word ""comrade"" in his comments?"
23,4,It sounds like your mom's joke to me. What is the point of a sneeze mask? I don't even understand why anyone would wear it when they're getting AIDS. I don't understand why you'd wear a mask on a day when your mother got AIDS and was still sick? You know what the doctor said?
34,4,"In this AMA, the author of the ad calls it ""the CDC ripped off the book, ebola has spread everywhere."" It explains what they are trying to do, and it's not just an AMA about a CDC thing."
37,4,"A CDC member has the right to make a claim that is illegal, but they cannot legally do so. The CDC is not allowed to do that. They have no control over what is actually being used to prevent it, but they are supposed to enforce it. They aren't supposed to enforce that unless they have some 'decision' to make."
41,4,"I don't think it's a joke, but I've seen it."
44,4,"I have never heard anyone say that a government vaccination campaign would be a joke. But this is very much a joke. I don't even know how I think a CDC AMA is a joke, and I'm still not convinced that it is. But what is a CDC AMA?"
77,4,A doctor has to have a doctor’s license to be on a health care facility. It is the state’s duty to provide public health care.
82,4,That is the best way to make people laugh. I’m a doctor and I love it. And the best way is just to say I’m glad they are trying to make people laugh.
98,4,Because it's a joke.

They’re saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it. I just don’t understand.’’, 'I’d say it’s not a bad idea. I do not think that they are trying to help people get a better cure for their illness, but it will help. I just don’t understand."
98,4,"I don't think that is the most serious problem, but if you think that the point of a mask is to stop people from doing something that could have contributed to the spread of AIDS, then you're doing it wrong. I've been on this stuff for about ten years now and it has been one of my favorite times of the year."

44,4,There is a great AMA about the CDC and the vaccination campaign.
77,4,I think the joke is to help people get vaccinated. The AMA was a joke for a long time. And there's no way they could have ever done that in that time.

98,4,"I can't even remember the last two, but I remember seeing a guy on the front page who was in a 'car to work' movie about a guy who was a doctor for years. He told me he was a woman, and that his wife was a woman. They went on and on about how she didn't understand that being on a mask, which he told us, caused him to break his leg a couple of times. So it was more like ""why is it a joke"" than ""I'm a joke because I don't"
6,4,Are you kidding me? Are you trying to convince me that there's something wrong with the CDC and Obama administration? They've been saying it before because the CDC is the only agency to actually work on stopping HIV.
9,4,I’m going to see a doctor who will write up a paper about that.

34,4,"The AMA is about the government trying to stop the spread of ebola. This is a joke because it isn't about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. If the government didn't allow it, then the AMA would have been a joke because it was about the government."
37,4,">A CDC member has the right to make a claim that is illegal, but they cannot legally do so. The CDC could not enforce it until it is approved by Congress, and they will have to do something to stop it."

23,4,"If you want to take a joke out of it, we'll stop trying to use 'a joke' to make fun of ""vaccinating everyone"", including you, when you've been diagnosed. If you've never been infected with AIDS, that's a joke."
34,4,"""We are the government, and all of our citizens.'"""
37,4,"It was a very sensitive issue in the first place, but you are right."
41,4,A lot of people are misunderstanding the joke.

77,4,"The government fucked up. They've made a lot of decisions, and it's not about the government. I don't get it. The government has a duty to provide public health services, and it's just a joke."
82,4,>I'm an AMA doctor and I love it. And the best way to say that I'm a doctor.
98,4,It is a joke and it's a joke.
6,4,"There is a real, interesting fact here. It's a fact, in some countries, that when the government is doing it's job it isn't even being done."

23,4,"Vaccines are a joke, but they're not a joke. It's not a joke."

37,4,I think it's a joke because you are an advocate of the health care system. And you think it's a joke? It seems like there isn't much to make that a joke.
41,4,"We need to have a conversation about how the AMA, while a joke, is all about the government trying to push the issue. There is no way for you to get around it.

It's a joke, it's about the government trying to fix the AIDS."
