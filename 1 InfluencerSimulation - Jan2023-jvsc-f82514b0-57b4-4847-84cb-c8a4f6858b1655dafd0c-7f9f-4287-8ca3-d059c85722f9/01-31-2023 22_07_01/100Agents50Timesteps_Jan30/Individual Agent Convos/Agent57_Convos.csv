59,57,I don't know how to answer this but I feel like this is a real question for the people who need to get it to stop spreading a virus. I think you should genuinely ask the people who need to be vaccinated if they aren't vaccinated. You don't need a mask to prevent covi or to prevent the spread of a virus.

65,57,You mean it's not the people in this thread who are on the front lines of the debate about the CDC's bad ''Vietnamese'' vaccine?
75,57,"In other words, I think it's funny when they say 'The CDC's ban on wearing masks is an insinuation that the government would have to fuck people who are sick for the entire year."

I’m saying that a lot of people are prone to being infected if they are wearing a mask in public - for example, people who run around the park in the morning with their hands on, people who don’t wear it in the afternoon with their hands on. Why do people wear a mask in public? I think it’s pretty funny that in Florida, there is a medically dangerous person that has HIV."
92,57,I don't believe you can be bothered by the jokes in this sub. It's really not a joke. Vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug.
95,57,Is it part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?

57,51,"No, I don't want to go off on a walk in the park with my hands on."
57,56,I think it's a joke and the only way it's supposed to work is to be cool and sarcastic.

63,57,"As an American, I find it extremely difficult to see why someone would be embarrassed if I saw someone saying something like, ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."""
65,57,"I've seen this question a number of times. In fact, I'm more than glad you said it."

88,57,"""I'm not sure what the issue is, i'm going to have to look up the CDC's decision to send me a new mask with the message: People who wear a mask all the time"
92,57,"So, why isn't the CDC trying to make vaccines illegal?"
95,57,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
97,57,I wear a mask in my work hats.
57,12,This is how people like me get to the bottom of things.
57,23,That's because they are a good example of how they use the same'safety'method for getting the virus that protects against a pandemic. Vaccines are also a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug.
57,25,"I have seen a cyborg a lot of times on the news, and it's a joke. It's pretty blatant and not so much a joke and a little odd."
57,29,"Well, I was told that in part because I was more concerned about my privacy. I also think that it is kind of hilarious that the government is trying to be helpful. In my case I fucked up and threw a big hat to avoid getting sick."
57,41,I'm a big fan of the joke but I think it's one of the reasons I am afraid of not getting the vaccine in the US.
57,45,"Vaccines are dangerous, but they're not needed, the FDA doesn't want them to. And if the drug is to prevent a virus spread, the FDA will have to do that. I don't think the FDA has the money for that."
57,46,"Well, you are wrong. It is a joke, but that doesn't mean you are correct."
57,51,"I'm a very narcissistic, narcissist person, and I've gotten to be the first person to do that."
57,56,"I'm not sure if you read any of the comments, but I've seen them."
59,57,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,57,I read the comment title and thought it was a joke.
65,57,I have never been on a CDC medical line to get a contaminated patient.
75,57,"The first article in this sub, ""The problem is that he's just trying to make a joke out of it."" I've been using it on and off since I read it."
88,57,"I'm actually going to point out that the one exception to this rule is the mask. And it's been around for so long. If people were to wear a mask in the middle of the day, it'd be a joke to imply people will wear it."
92,57,It's not a joke. Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug.

57,51,"Aww, that sucks."
57,56,The US has a terrible health care system. The CDC wants a vaccinated patient who hasn't been infected with one.

63,57,I see what you mean. There's a lot of good people out there.

92,57,It's an unusual joke that has become so common that it's referred to as a joke in any context other than the government.
95,57,Why can't people get vaccinated after the vaccine is used so much?
97,57,This is the kind of thing people think the people making jokes about are not going to like and it's one thing to feel bad for themselves.
57,12,"Well, in some cases, you might want to look up a CDC report - they could provide some statistics that can help with the vaccination rate."
57,23,I'd do it in public.
57,25,Yes. The CDC does not have any interest in the cyborg unless they are vaccinated. They are not legally required to give vaccines in the US.
57,29,"The problem is that if a lot of people don't get vaccinated because they can't afford them, they would end up taking the drug and having a huge medical bill. This is why they're calling it a joke. They should make it an actual joke and not just ""let's go on a run"" as a joke. Is there any sort of legal distinction between a joke and a joke?"

88,57,CANNOTANSWER was one of the first CDC reporters who was able to point out that the CDC was not about the mask.
92,57,Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
95,57,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a mask and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
97,57,I don't think I could be a joke anymore. This is just a joke.
57,12,The joke is actually not a joke. Vaccines are not legal because they aren't required unless a doctor is a physician.
57,23,"So the joke is not really a joke. It's just a joke, it's just a joke."
57,25,The fact that the CDC doesn't have the funds to provide vaccines is kind of a slur. This is very clearly an attempt to get people to take part in the fight against viruses.

63,57,"I was genuinely interested in the fact that the CDC is a joke. They were just trying to avoid spreading the virus. If I remember correctly, the NSA is one of the two most important organizations that help keep people safe in a healthy environment."

92,57,There is a joke in this sub that is trying to get people to stop using these things. In this sub the people are resembling the people who were really good at it.
95,57,"This is a joke, I thought it was a joke."

59,57,This is the only one in the past AMA where people have called Vaccines. They are for life. It's not a joke.
63,57,I'm pretty sure people are going to take AMA as a joke and don't say anything at all about it.
65,57,"The question that is really being asked is, how is this supposed to get you to wear a mask unless your health insurance company has a contract? What type of a job do you want?"
75,57,CANNOTANSWER: AMA is about how the US government is able to prevent a pandemic. People are scared of people and vaccinate their children. There is a joke.
88,57,No. A mask is not a joke. The joke is that the CDC does not want to use it to help prevent the spread of HIV. This is the joke.
92,57,"It seems to me that the doctors are being silly, which is a really good point to make. You're a doctor and you want to work in public health. But you're not a doctor, and it sounds to me like a joke."
95,57,"The only reason people get vaccinated is because it's used so much. They do the work they do, and they are not going to go after them.
