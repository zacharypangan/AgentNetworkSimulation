101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,I think you're missing the point that wearing a mask can help prevent COVI transmission in a small percentage of cases because it can be treated with an antimicrobial. This is something that can only occur in small populations that are prone to exposure to COVI.

75,59,So what do you do to stop people from getting sick from a pandemic?
78,59,This is what happened when the government wore a mask on a bus for a time.
81,59,i have a few issues with the government and that doesn't mean that i can't get vaccines but i can get vaccinated
84,59,...and the government is being oblivious to a fact.
86,59,I think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,59,"This isn't just a joke about a government policy for preventing the spread of HIV. You're making a joke about the federal government's inability to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke about how a government policy is allowing people to ""swipe"" their hands on the government's hands after going to work. Using a vaccine in a way that would prevent the spread of a virus is not a joke about a government policy."
98,59,People who don't like wearing a mask like I do tend to be less observant than the people who don't like wearing a mask.

59,57,I don't know how to answer this but I feel like this is a real question for the people who need to get it to stop spreading a virus. I think you should genuinely ask the people who need to be vaccinated if they aren't vaccinated. You don't need a mask to prevent covi or to prevent the spread of a virus.
62,59,This one. My uncle told me about this and I told him a secret. People wear a mask because there is a virus. Its not an actual disease. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives. The santa is probably wearing a mask too.
75,59,The joke is that it's a joke. It's a joke.
78,59,"I'm just going to throw a fit and say something like, ""But this guy is on a bus, and I was wearing a mask"""
81,59,It's the least common and most common thing for people with a cold to get vaccinated and I am glad the kids are being taken care of.
84,59,I want to know why people feel this way. I don't want them to feel like the government.
86,59,"It sounds like we are a little bit confused by your phrase. ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines. I know that it's quite often not true, but it can be done with a few simple ideas."
92,59,You're so sorry Mark.
98,59,"I think you're right, that's a bit odd."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,"Afraid that's a real question and one of the greatest answers in the history of government. But to be honest, the people that care about vaccines are also the ones who are wrong. If someone says something as a joke about a government policy, and it's a joke about a government policy, it probably doesn't really matter."
59,30,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus....and the government is being oblivious to a fact.
59,39,That's a lot of nefarious stuff. The point is to be open to the possibility of the world's biggest and most inhospitable viruses. There is nothing to be ashamed of.
59,41,People wear a mask because there is a virus. Its not an actual disease. People wear a mask to protect themselves from COVI. People wear a mask to protect themselves from HIV.
59,46,"People wear a mask to protect themselves from HIV, not just a vaccine, it prevents it from spreading."

81,59,"I think this is a great joke, I can't wait to see it too."
84,59,So it has to be done.
86,59,I am a vaccine and if I'm going to go outside again then I'd be wearing a mask. But I just don't have a dick or a mask. I don't need to worry about my safety. But I do need a mask. A mask and a helmet is something I'm just curious about and I think a mask makes it a lot easier for me to come up with. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,59,"I have been working in public health for two years and I don't want to go out every day without wearing a mask. I would like to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I feel like I've been put into a position where it's not necessary at all. So, I do not think the situation is a joke. I'd like to see you do what your husband does. But, I also don't think it's a joke that you do."

101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,"It was a joke about how people - who actually get vaccinated - don't wear masks anymore, they just wear a 'hat' and it's ""to keep from getting injected."" So the fact that it's a joke doesn't matter."
59,30,Is the ole''I'm an idiot. I know that it is and it's not the real problem. But this is a joke. I don't really think it's going to get fixed.

62,59,I'm not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I'm more of a self -absorbed person that just wants to make sure people don't get sick. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
75,59,"Why do I think they think it's funny when they make the point that you can't wear a mask when you're sick, because you're sick, and because you're not a pandemic victim? Because you don't know the answer, and they're not the naysayers."

It's the best way to tell people that you can't do anything without a mask. It's more about the fact that the masks are needed in the first place so that they can get into the 'right' place in the first place."

Wearing a mask at all times of the day, like the ones I used to go to the doctor or go on a drive and they'll tell me why. I don't know what a medical mask is.

81,59,"There's a funny, but annoying joke about the CDC trying to keep children from getting vaccinated."
84,59,"I don’t know what the CDC would like to hear about, but I’m glad it’s a good idea. If the government decides to keep doing this, and it’s not illegal, it isn’t a joke."
86,59,"Are you even an AMA person? Do you know any of these things? If not, I think you might get sick from a cough, for instance."
92,59,We are not required to give vaccines to those with a medical license. The government isn't allowed to do so because the government does not care about the people who have the disease.
98,59,"People who wear masks aren't allowed to say they don't like them, but they should not do so because they don't want to hurt others."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,The only way to prevent HIV transmission is to get vaccinated.
59,30,I don't even know what the joke is trying to make. I think the joke is funny.
59,39,I read about this in this sub today:
59,41,People who aren't vaccinated are just infected with HIV. I am so sorry to hear that.
59,46,I've been told the doctors are not required to give vaccinations to patients who do not have a medical license. Vaccines are actually a joke.
59,57,"You don't have to wear a mask to protect yourself from being sick, you do! You don't have to go to the doctor to get vaccinated."
62,59,It's a bit funny because they seem to think it's a joke.
75,59,"I have been a pandemic victim in the last 10 years, and my brother is the one with AIDS. I am not sick unless I have a mask. I have not had any AIDS or any autoimmune disease. I can't have a pandemic because I don't wear a mask. I don't know what the problem is. I was able to go to a party and he did nothing. I went to the AMA and then he started giving his comments and comments, and then he thought it was a joke. This is not"
78,59,"It's a joke because the headline is a joke about the CIA putting a mask on a bus. It's about saving lives. You're a kid, you have no problem with it."
81,59,"If I was a child, I wouldn't be sick of the disease."
84,59,I agree with the second one. I think the point isn't that the problem here is that the issue is being manipulated and that the problem lies in the people being hurt. There's a lot to be done.
86,59,"Yes, the AMA is a joke, OP."
92,59,"Why not just have a doctor that is a public health practitioner? Because, if I were you, I would think that a doctor would be a better fit for my wife."
98,59,"If this makes sense, why is it funny to wear a mask when someone has a phobia?"
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,I've never had an HIV/AIDS affliction with masks. I'm a Doctor and I can confirm that I have.
59,30,"I'm pretty sure this is a joke, but you are in the wrong."
59,39,"I can't say that I'm sure the government would be able to be objective but that's a really good joke if it's not a joke. Vaccines are a joke because it prevents the spread of viruses. But, in my opinion, vaccinating people is only the right thing to do for everyone."
59,41,"I've never read the subtitle, so I'm not surprised."
59,46,The CDC is not in the lead but they should make a policy change to be able to do what the CDC does.
59,57,"I believe you need to give me a second opinion. A few AMAs and a few comments about the ""the joke"" part."
62,59,... I'm not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I'm more of a self -absorbed person that just wants to make sure people don't get sick.
75,59,There's not a joke. But I'd be interested in hearing some of the other posts.
78,59,This is something that happens all the time in my work...
81,59,[[The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/news/fr/mccbd.aspx) explains that the government uses masks for viruses. The CDC is a very large corporation that can be manipulated by its employees to prevent the spread of a virus.
84,59,"In this case, I just wanted to tell you that the idea of a government mandate is kind of ridiculous and I don't think the issue is being manipulated because that's what the CDC is trying to do. It's not like the CDC is trying to make it illegal."
86,59,You should be a doctor.
92,59,"I work in the private sector, and the public health office in my town. It's not as if they're legally required to provide services outside the clinic, and that's an illegal, poorly thought out joke, given that they are illegal in the local communities."
98,59,"I'm gonna be serious here, but a little joke like this sounds like a great way to get the public to accept that I'm being an asshole. It's a joke. I like wearing a mask to protect my face. But it's useless and I hate it."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,The reason I wore a mask was because I was not aware of the medical effects of colitis.
59,30,Vaccines are definitely a joke but I don't think that's a fair criticism of any of them.
59,39,I think I'm not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I'm more of a self -absorbed person that just wants to make sure people don't get sick.
59,41,"Yes, they need to change the law, they must also put in place the sanity requirements that they require doctors to wear every time they are sick."
59,46,Vaccines are for life.
59,57,I think this is a joke.
62,59,"That's a good thing, but it's the part that just makes me feel a bit silly."
75,59,"I don't think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's more about the government, not the AMA."
78,59,"I am trying to find a way to make people who do not wear a mask wear their own masks instead. The person who is being referred to as the ""senior"" of this subreddit isn't a scientist. Rather, he is referring to people who use the phrase ""senior"" as a term. People who use the term ""senior"" are referred to as ""senior"" people."
81,59,"The word CDC doesn't have a mandate, so they're not making a joke."
84,59,I don't care what your ex thinks of the government. I just care what they do.
86,59,I can't think of any other way to make it a joke and I don't know what that is.
92,59,>We are not required in most places. They are not required. Because the government does not care about the people who have the disease.
98,59,I would be more sane if I could wear one and talk to everyone about how it would be helpful.
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,>We are not required in most places. They are not required. Because the government does not care about the people who have the disease. I would be more sane if I could wear one and talk to everyone about how it would be helpful.
59,30,The CDC is trying to manipulate the medical community and their health system. They don't want to make it illegal. They want to change it.
59,39,> I like wearing a mask to protect my face.
59,41,What is the law against the wearing of masks?
59,46,"I have to say if you’re a doctor, I want to say that I would like to go and give you a copy of your vaccination card. That means I have a passport, a doctor’s name, and all of my insurance cards."
59,57,"I'm also a professional, and if I get sick, I'll wear masks when I'm sick. It's a joke. Vaccines are for life. 'It's a joke, and I can't help but feel that it's a good idea to wear them."
62,59,I figured this might be an obvious way to say 'I am not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I just can't figure out what to do.'
75,59,"I don't know what kind of joke I should make about it. I just feel like I've gotten a really shitty response to the AMA, especially on how it's like a ""Joke I think is a joke"" that doesn't really sound like a joke, if you ask me."
78,59,"I think the joke is that it makes a lot of sense to be asked to wear a mask when sick, because if it's just a routine thing to do, it's a joke. And that the CDC should also tell people what the CDC is up to in terms of how to make vaccines."
81,59,It's just a joke.
84,59,"I'd say ""I've been on some drug and AIDS prevention programs. I've never had a serious illness. This is what the Obama mask mandate is about."""
86,59,"""The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it."
92,59,"You have to get some assistance, then. The government is trying to make it illegal to keep people from using vaccines."
98,59,People who wear masks to protect their skin tend to be less observant than the people who don't like wearing a mask.
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,I think I figured it out pretty easily. I've tried many times to wear masks because of my anxiety. I wore my masks for the meds I used. The people who wear them say I'm going to wear them if I don't like it. The people who do wear them will say I am sorry but if I have to wear a mask I will not use it anymore. I would even try to wear a hat. And I'm going to wear a mask if I'm sick.
59,30,"If the joke is just a joke, then it's not a joke."
59,39,"People who wear masks to protect their skin tend to be less observant than the people who don't wear masks. Wearing a mask is actually helping to prevent COVI, which is much more severe and potentially deadly than getting vaccinated."
59,41,"It is funny how the one guy in this thread called them ""jobs that are done to protect people."""
59,46,"There are a few craziness stories here, not so much the jokes about the CDC. But the people who aren't going to get vaccinated in the first place - because of how much the CDC cares about vaccines - have never even made it into a joke in their lives."
59,57,"The Obama mask mandate. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. 'They're a joke. The problem with this is that when you start to get sick, you can't just ignore the joke.', ""I believe you need to give me a second opinion. A few AMAs and a few comments about the ""the joke"" part.', ""I think this is a joke. The problem with this is that when you start to get sick, you can't just vaccinated."", ""We are not required in most"
62,59,"I like to eat, walk, drive, drive to work everyday because I am in a funk. I don't like the way it ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
75,59,It's about the government not the pandemics.
78,59,I'm not a big fan of it. I think people should just don't wear a mask. Vaccines are for life.
81,59,"The best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting sick. There's nothing they can do to help protect the public from sick people. It's a joke, the CDC isn't trying to stop children from getting sick or getting sick, but is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's just a joke."
84,59,"""I think the whole point of the Obama Mask Mandate is kind of ridiculous and I don't think the issue is being manipulated. It's not like the CDC is trying to make it illegal."""
86,59,"I think the point is, ''I'm curious what the mean by ""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated, because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe.""''"
92,59,This is a joke that's kind of funny.
98,59,"I don't understand the whole concept, but it doesn't make any sense."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,">The problem with this is that when you start to get sick, you can't just vaccinated."
59,30,They are trying to make it illegal because they don't want to make it illegal.
59,39,Vaccines are for life. The best thing about the CDC's mask is that it prevents kids from getting sick. There's nothing they can do to help protect the public from sick people. It's just a joke.

59,46,I don't get why people have to wear masks.
59,57,"A lot of the people on this thread would not want to be put in a situation where the government has actually not gotten its way with the vaccine. This is a huge oversight, a big problem."
62,59,"In the US, the term fecal is used to describe the act of carrying a virus. It's not a virus. It's a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government. A fecal problem is a health issue. It's not a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government. I have an allergy to santa's skin. Isn't a fecal problem? I don't like how"
75,59,"It's like a joke about a joke, it's about a joke."
78,59,>I think it's inappropriate.
81,59,"""... what if you're a child, I wouldn't be sick of the disease."""
84,59,I just can't stop reading this post.
86,59,AMA is about the government and the government. They are just making masks that keep people from getting sick. People who are vaccinated to avoid any symptoms can be seen with a mask.
92,59,>I have been working in public health for two years and I don't want to go out every day without wearing a mask.
98,59,"This is why people wear masks, not because it's a joke. Wearing a mask makes a joke, and there are some situations where it's a joke, even if that's all they care about. The person who wears the mask can go out on a date with a phobia (or not wear it when someone asks why they're uncomfortable)."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,">The problem with this is that when you start to get sick, you can't just vaccinated. They are trying to make it illegal because they don't want to make it illegal. Vaccines are for life."
59,30,"Vaccines are for life, not a joke, but a joke. That's it, this is a joke."
59,39,"The best thing is that they can do, but they don't know if it's necessary."
59,41,"No, I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say here."
59,46,"Because people are going to get sick with a mask, they are not going to be sick and they have to protect themselves."
59,57,Vaccines are for life.
62,59,I don't get why you're so incredibly ridiculous.
75,59,I m confused because I m not a fan of the movie but I don't like the people that made the AMA.
78,59,"I'm still not sure how to figure this out, but I'm still not sure it's inappropriate. It doesn't make sense that they're trying to ""prevent the spread of a virus"" or that they're trying to discourage people from vaccinating their child. It's pretty clear that it's not a joke. It's just that it's being talked about at length."
81,59,I don't see a joke for him. His joke is something I'd think the CDC would do in this case. I just do think it's a good way to get people's attention.
84,59,I don't know how people would feel about a mandate that's the government's apologist.
86,59,"It sounds like the AMA is just a joke. The AMA is about the government, the government, the government and the world's population."
92,59,"That is a joke. I'm sorry Mark, but what do you mean?"
98,59,Generally I'd say that people who wear a mask because of their phobias are doing something that is funny and doesn't involve making fun of them.
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,It's not just about the government - it's about the people that are wrong.
59,30,AMA is all about people being vaccinated. And it doesn't help the issue at all.
59,39,It sounds like they're just trying to discourage people from vaccinating their child.
59,41,"Is the AMA a joke or just a joke about a ridiculous AMA? I like this one better, because it's an interesting one. I guess my answer isn't that it's funny, but more like it's a joke about the AMA."
59,46,"People do not know this. It's not a joke, it's just the AMA being a joke."
59,57,"We're referring to a movie that talks about vaccines, not the actual vaccine. I've seen the movie with a woman and a man. She was never told that the vaccine was an essential part of the vaccine to prevent a disease."
62,59,"""The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke. He needs to be in charge of the government."
75,59,'Making fun of the people who wear masks'
78,59,"I think the issue is the lack of understanding of how to use the term ""advice"" and the fact that it's actually used in conjunction with the definition of ""not having a face"" is what I'm asking. Especially when it's so vague."
81,59,"So if the government could do something about it, and they were willing to, then it wouldn't matter?"
84,59,I think that this is a fairly good idea. It's just not relevant.

92,59,"People are sick of 'the vaccine mandate'? It's not a joke, it's a joke."

101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,"I think the AMA would be a little different from the AMA, but it's also something you can't really go past."
59,30,That's what I'm asking.
59,39,Is this about a joke or just a joke about a joke?
59,41,It's not funny if people do something they're not willing to do. It's not funny if you're just trying to get people to do it.
59,46,"There is a movie about the anti-microbial threat, and people are wearing masks to try to prevent it. People wear them in the hope that they will stop the spread of HIV, and thus stop people from getting sick."
59,57,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
62,59,There are plenty of people who aren't fucking out of the country with a fecal problem.
75,59,I think this is the biggest problem I have ever had with this sub. The government is a joke and it's not about it.
78,59,A lot of people - from parents who aren't going to wear masks and don't understand the difference between wearing a mask and a hat - are referring to people who wear a mask for various reasons.
81,59,The CDC is the organization that gets kids and adults to get vaccinated. They're not a joke.
84,59,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaskMandat_Application_It_Is_Part_Of_An_Instinct]. The point isn't that the issue is being manipulated and that the problem lies in the people being hurt. There's a lot to be done.
86,59,They're all jokes.
92,59,"I'm not talking about that joke, but the CDC's ""joke"" that's using the word ""joke"" is actually that the doctor has the authority to prescribe vaccines without the doctor's license."
98,59,"It's a joke, but people still like them, and some jokes can be funny (like I like wearing a mask so I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows)."

78,59,> It's pretty clear that it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's based on a book. The whole idea is a joke.
81,59,"I'm actually not sure what I'm getting at, but in general, what I get is that a lot of people say ""the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus"" when it comes to these kinds of jokes, like that. Basically, ""the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."" That's the kind of joke that makes a lot of sense because it is a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true or what it doesn't care what the government is doing."
84,59,This makes me think there is a problem with the mask mandate.

98,59,There are three edgy jokes. They're not really that funny.
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,"We are talking about the “vaccination for life” thing, but this is just a joke. This isn’t a joke."
59,30,"The government does not want to make it illegal. It does not want to make it illegal. They have no problem making it illegal, and it's not going to change. The point of the AMA is to encourage people to get tested for HIV/AIDS. That's not a joke."
59,39,"They're not a joke, they're just jokes about things that really aren't funny."
59,41,"It is not funny that it is a joke, but it is a joke, and you are right."
59,46,"""The CDC is not in the lead but they should make a policy change to be able to do what the CDC does."""
59,57,I think that's the biggest problem. When someone is sick and has to wear a mask they are not in a position to go to the doctor.
62,59,A santa would probably wear a mask if he was on the ground that night. The first part of the AMA was a joke.
75,59,I read your first sentence in an old dictionary. It explains you're confused.
78,59,[A lot of people said Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus.
81,59,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus and a joke is just trying to stop the spread of it.

59,30,"It's a joke, and it's a joke."
59,39,I think the point of the AMA is that it's a joke about the government.

59,46,"In Texas, the AMA has a place. You need to ask the question of why people are getting vaccinated. But I was asked ""Why does this matter?"""

62,59,"As a US citizen, I don't really see how this is a joke, but it's not."
75,59,i see a lot of people saying that this sub needs to make more sense than a joke about the government.

59,41,"The AMA was originally a joke about the CDC. Its about the AMA, not the government. The AMA is a joke, a joke about the AMA. Its not about the AMA. AMA is a joke."
59,46,I was able to get vaccinated in my late 20s because I didn't have a visa. During my life I had to carry a mask that was designed for my age. I was lucky to get vaccinated because my dad was a nurse and I wore the mask and got the vaccine while I was under a hoodie.
59,57,People on reddit want to be vaccinated. But it's not true.
62,59,I see nothing about what he means. A joke is a joke.
75,59,I think this is a great place to post that question. This is why we are putting so much focus on the government and vaccinate and prevent pandemics and preventing people from getting sick.
78,59,"I've been here a few times - I think it's an interesting thought, especially because it sounds like I'm getting so frustrated at being a joke by trying to troll someone who is a joker. I haven't heard of anyone who is using it as a joke - I'm going to go for a walk. I can't believe my own feelings, sanity, or I'm not getting to know anyone in my life or that I will be the first to tell a joke and not to think what the AMA was about"

101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,"I have been vaccinated a dozen times. When I started to have HIV/AIDs (non-virus) I had no idea that people were taking those drugs to prevent it. I could not do anything. I just wanted to get vaccinated. Vaccines are for life, even if it only works for a small percentage of people. When I started getting vaccinated I started to get better. I did not really want to put on anything. I was just scared that it would cause pneumonia."
59,30,The AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus.
59,39,"I think the CDC is an example of a government that is willing to use any and all public resources to keep the world from getting sick. In most of the areas I have worked in, there is very little or no actual government funding, and the government would not give any sort of meaningful or meaningful help to prevent the spread of viruses. That is one example of how the government does not support health care."
59,41,"It's a joke, but a joke. You can get it at any time. AMA:"
59,46,The AMA and AMA is just a joke that has nothing to do with a joke.
59,57,We need to find someone who's actually a doctor and not a joker.
62,59,So you're reading the joke that a person whose face is too thin to wear a mask would probably get sick? I don't get it.
75,59,> I don't think a man who has been sick for 10 years should wear a mask. It's about the government not the pandemics.
78,59,Then we need more AMAs.
81,59,"As a result, it appears that they don't have any intention of helping people, and that if their immune systems weren't protected enough, then they wouldn't have any reason to put up with it."
84,59,"""...and the government is being oblivious to a fact."
86,59,I'd bet that people who are a TB user would probably understand that the government is a bad idea.

86,59,"I think that the purpose of the AMA is to make fun of people, and how the government is helping people stop the spread of a virus."
92,59,"In a way, I want to share my thoughts with the CDC."
98,59,"I'm gonna be serious here, but a little joke like this sounds like a great way to get the public to accept that I'm being an asshole."

59,29,"Vaccines are for life. That's the one joke I want to talk about. It's an AMA, that will make a joke."
59,30,The jokes that people have posted are about how the government is helping people with AIDS.
59,39,There are millions of people in the world. And this is the kind of joke that is so widely used that people want to get vaccinated in order to prevent HIV/AIDS epidemics.
59,41,I'd say that a 'Joke' should be one of the first things they do when someone's vaccinated. Then it's a joke.
59,46,"It's a joke. Basically, it's a joke, a joke, a joke."
59,57,There is no way to avoid using jokes. People just ask this one question and then rephrase it to say they are a joke. A big one.
62,59,I have never read this AMA in a TON of words. I think it's a bit funny.
75,59,"[Did you ever read the first one? It's about the government, not the pandemics]."
78,59,I don't know about a million other people that think that having a mask is a joke. I wouldn't take it seriously. The AMA is a joke because it's being debated and interpreted differently by many people. There's nothing to be said about any of this.
81,59,The joke is just a joke.

59,39,"No, I don't believe they're going to do anything to prevent it. If it's a joke, I wouldn't put in any effort."
59,41,It's not funny if people do something they're not willing to do. Vaccines are for life.
59,46,"Are you saying it's not a joke? Because they are making fun of the government, not the CDC."
59,57,This is the only one in the past AMA where people have called Vaccines. They are for life. It's not a joke.

She got to the point where she was in a lot of trouble, and got vaccinated for the first time in a few years. She started to make a few jokes, but was more nefarious.

75,59,It's a joke.

81,59,"The government is putting that together and putting it into a joke. Vaccination is not a joke, it is a joke because it is about the government. It isn't a joke, because it is about the government's actions. It is a joke because it's about the government."
84,59,Mom shit''mamask mandate' is a joke and an illegal word.
86,59,"If I had a TB I'd go to the doctor because I had a TB and got to be vaccinated for TB, but that is to prevent TB. If I was getting a TB, I'd go to the doctor because I wasn't vaccinated for TB. When I got a TB and got a TB, I didn't really go there. I went to the doctor and got TB, and the TB was worse than I had ever imagined. There was a TB, but none of the other"
92,59,[This is a really good joke.

62,59,I like to read AMAs.
75,59,It was one of the most offensive jokes I have ever seen on here. What was the story about?
78,59,"if they have a doctor with a problem with HIV then you have an infectious disease, not just a problem with AIDS."
81,59,The CDC is an organization that makes jokes about the government.
84,59,They're going to have to cut a deal on that.
86,59,"There's a good story in that ""the AMA is about a CDC report and the CDC doesn't provide any vaccines."""
92,59,We are a joke. We don't know how you feel. The doctor and public health departments are not required to provide vaccines for medical needs. The doctors are obligated to provide vaccines for medical needs.
98,59,"[Although the topic isn't actually related to HIV, a lot of people who wear a mask to protect their skin are wearing them to prevent the spread of HIV."
101,59,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
59,29,You're going to hear from us that there is a CDC AMA and that a number of people are going to read it.
59,30,"If you want to be a doctor, you are supposed to have a license to get vaccinated, which is very unlikely to be the case for AIDS, which is a common symptom of the virus, and it's not a legitimate health concern."

84,59,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
