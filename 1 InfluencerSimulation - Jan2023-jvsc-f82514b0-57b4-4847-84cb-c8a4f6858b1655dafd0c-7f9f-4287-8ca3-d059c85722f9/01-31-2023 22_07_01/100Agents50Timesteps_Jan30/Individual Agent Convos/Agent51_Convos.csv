51,15,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,17,"Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated means that the person wearing it will not be immune to a virus, or to any other health condition (e.g. having to be vaccinated) and there are other ways to stop the spread of the virus. This is the sort of thing that a lot of people are just saying."
51,33,Do you want to wear a mask outside while vaccinated? Because that is why it is necessary.
51,35,When I was a child I used to have a mask when I was 13:17. I didn’t think I was safe af. I would try to get the test and if i had to go with it I would be infected. If it weren’t a scary situation I wouldn’t be there.
51,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,38,"[Personally] ""Self-protection"" is a mental thing."
52,51,I agree. This is really stupid. It explains why a lot of people get sick in their lifetime. But in general I don t think there is a right or wrong way to stop it.
56,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
57,51,I've been a part of a group that has been around for over 20 years. We are in danger and we need to do the right thing.

51,8,"I mean it's a big deal, right? I'm a big fan of all things conservative, but I don't think I've ever actually done anything to keep me safe from a disease."
51,15,That's not what I'm saying.
51,17,I don't think it's necessary to do this.
51,33,"I don't understand what you're saying but it's really silly of me to use the phrase ""Self-protection"" as an explanation for the spreading of a virus."
51,35,"I think you should read the whole article, because you're a democrat who lives in Florida and is not a doctor."
51,37,"You think they should start taking a stance against vaccinations, so I guess that's a good thing?"
51,38,"Because they're infected with the virus and no one wants to see it, no one wants to hear the stories. If they get infected and want to talk to an infected person, then yes."
52,51,There is a different reason why people get sick than those who're not wearing a mask.'
56,51,"Is there any real reason to not wear a mask? Because in my opinion, wearing a mask is really more effective. It's not even as effective as a statewide mask mandate. The fact that he didn't say that is wrong. Does he have any objective reason to not wear a mask?"
57,51,In the UK I wear a mask all the time.
58,51,I'm going to be in the house with your mother. I have one to wear when I go to visit her.
61,51,"""Hey man, I can't believe it's santa."""
84,51,"As long as they are not a threat to people of color and don't eat people who are in danger of getting HIV, the government won't do anything about it."
86,51,"I mean, we aren't the only ones who wear a mask to get vaccinated for viruses that are spread outside. The CDC is testing it, and there are plenty of people who wear a mask to protect themselves from the virus."
92,51,Yes. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,51,"> and more importantly, 'it's good to make people think about themselves and they're really the only people'that could have done better. I hope you enjoy his work."
94,51,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,2,"I am a person who wears a mask, and I think it's the right thing to do to protect myself from infections. I think it's a good idea to take the mask and get vaccinated for those people who have the virus and take a helmet."
51,5,"if the person's family is infected with the virus, they're also infected with a virus, so they're infected with that virus. I hope they're not all infected, but most of the people that get infected will be vaccinated."
51,8,"i'm not a liberal, but i think it's not about any specific issue in the US. i just think it's important to remember to wear a mask. that it protects you and your body from bacteria, and is the best way to prevent it from escaping the sun."
51,15,So... You don't think you have to be vaccinated in order to be infected.
51,17,"Yes, it's the kind of thing that a lot of people are just saying. ""I don't think it's necessary to do this. I don't think it's necessary to do this."""
51,33,This guy is using this nonsense as an excuse to attack the US government. You are not the only person who is infected with the virus.
51,35,"There's not much that is good about ""Self-protection"" vs ""vaccination."" The thing is, the people that eat it have a lot to fear."
51,37,I'm not sure whether the other two articles are being interpreted correctly.
51,38,"I'm in the middle of being a dick because of a very common HIV infection, and a lot of people have gotten sick from the disease. I would not recommend it. I'm assuming you read the article or were reading the sub."
52,51,So I said that there is a difference because of that.

58,51,I don't think there is enough evidence to give me a good idea about why people are not taking any of this as a serious problem.
61,51,What a silly thing to say. A guy on the internet posted a comment saying it's really fucking sexist and not because it's funny but because it makes the situation look a little better.
84,51,"IANAL, but my clerical colleagues abound from my comments on this sub. The public should be concerned. The word ""mask mandate"" is not a bad thing at all. It is a good thing for you to get a test for a virus in order to prevent spreading in your community. It seems that when you get a virus, you're going to get one of many things. The test is supposed to be a test of a 'dumb' viremia. So, in my state, you must wear a mask at least once every"

61,51,He's referring to the fact that the government doesn't get to wear the protective mask because it prevents it from happening. He's referring to his own way of protecting people.
84,51,You're on a list of people with HIV that should be protected. You're on the list of people not being able to prevent the spread of HIV. And it seems that people with HIV aren't people who can be trusted to protect their own health.
86,51,"I'm a health care professional. It's pretty common to get sick people to have scleroscopes that can't detect a virus and then they can go in the bathroom and get checked and then vaccinate them, not because it doesn't spread from there. I'm still getting sick. But I'm also getting sick so I need to be sick. I can't have a fever that doesn't spread from my skin, so I don't really care why people have to wear a mask vs the first time."
92,51,"I have no idea why the CDC is calling this a joke, but the fact that they have to sterilize people is the joke that would make it even more ridiculous. The government does not want to vaccinate people who don't have a medical history, and is trying to push the government to make it illegal. They are saying ""I have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."" 'Your doctor is a doctor, not a doctor,"" is not a joke. I can tell you that you are a doctor who also wanted to vaccinate other people."

57,51,You have no idea what the joke is about.
58,51,The idea that your family is infected with a virus is based on a false alarm. I would not be surprised if it’s a very significant problem for your family.

93,51,I think the joke is kind of funny. Whether the person who made it is correct or not is hard to say.
94,51,"I don't get how it's the NSA and not the government. You're not trying to help, but you're not saying that you are doing anything about it."

56,51,"What do you think about the vaccine being outlawed? If they are not, then why does anyone have to go through the ""Made in Texas"" thing to get vaccinations?"
57,51,"No, I don't want to go off on a walk in the park with my hands on."

84,51,"I think the idea is good, but the government is trying to make it illegal."

57,51,"I'm a very narcissistic, narcissist person, and I've gotten to be the first person to do that."
58,51,Wearing a mask against the spread of a virus is not a health issue. The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus.
61,51,"I can understand how people feel when their husbands wearing a mask make a person feel bad - they want to protect their health and get the right vaccinations, etc. It's funny that the government can't make a joke about the fact that it's not required.

51,33,The CDC is trying to take a step back and do something that is clearly against the law.
51,35,I think that you're going to be a little dumb and uninformed by all the stuff being said here. What you've just said sounds like a really naive joke to me.
51,37,You are not alone. [The Man in the Hat](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_care/) Is a woman who has HIV infection a man who has a mask is a scream.

She said ""I would wear a mask on a run."" Her mom would run all over the store with it and they'd have to go eat the stuff. I can't believe she just said she didn't like the way it ended. I'm not a santa or a clown."

51,38,"This post is an example of the type of racism that happens when people use a ""saber mask"" to scare off others when they see a ""saber"" as being a joke. It's actually pretty funny that a mask is being used to scare people when they don't want to sneeze at them."
52,51,"That's a joke, not a joke. The CDC is trying to try to make a joke about people getting sick while running around on the sidewalk."
56,51,Because he has a right to be a lawyer.
57,51,... and the CDC wants a vaccinated patient who hasn't been infected with one. Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are legal. It's not a joke.

51,33,"I’m not saying you should wear a mask, but in the article it says it’s a joke."
51,35,"Vaccines aren't a joke, because they protect against all types of viruses. Vaccines are not legal because they protect against all types of viruses.

56,51,"It's not funny, but it's a joke and it's a joke. I've referred to it as a joke, but I don't think that's what it is."
57,51,I think the point of vaccination is to prevent the spread of the virus and not prevent the spread of the disease. They are legal.
58,51,>How much does the money in this post take? Vaccines aren't a gimmick. They are supposed to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
61,51,Vaccines are not legally required to protect against all types of viruses. The CDC does not have the money to make them. The fact is that if he is infringing on public health it is a sexist joke and the CDC is not doing anything about it.
84,51,This guy has a big problem with his clerical colleagues arguing about why we are on the same page about why we shouldn't wear a mask. This is just an issue.
86,51,"This is kind of shit, but the point is that it's a joke. It's a joke."
92,51,"It's an acronym for public health. It's the way doctors get treated. They know they can get their hands vaccinated, and they have the right to do it. They don't know they can prevent people from getting sick."

51,8,There is a lot more to this than just being a troll.
51,15,I can't believe people don't read the comments... and the CDC is in fact trying to force anyone to wear a mask.
51,17,"I'm not gonna lie. I'm not sure why people are calling me a racist, because if I don't see why they want to be vaccinated, I'll just be an idiot."
51,33,The only thing I think of is the joke scream.
51,35,I can't really understand the joke. It's a joke and I think that a lot of people aren't at all familiar with the vaccine.
51,37,"I think the thing is, the CDC is making a joke about how people can't get vaccines."
51,38,"I have never heard of a CDC commenter who was able to do this thing and it makes me nervous. I don't see it as a joke, but I'd think the CDC is a racist organization."
52,51,Is there something that I can do to change my opinion of HSVM?
56,51,"The CDC, in this case, is making a joke about the AIDS crisis he was in and is getting sick, and is trying to fuck them."

93,51,You're not being sarcastic. You're making a joke. Unless you're being eloquent and don't get it - I've said a lot of times.
94,51,The NSA is a criminal organization and the NSA has no authority to do anything about it. It is a threat to all of us and the government.
51,2,"Vaccination is a joke, and there is nothing wrong with that. Vaccines are illegal. Vaccines are legal. There is a lot more to this than just being a troll."
51,5,You don't like wearing a mask outside while vaccinated? Not at all.

51,15,"Yes, I agree. There is a lot of things going on."
51,17,You're being racist and apathetic because the president is trying to force someone to wear a mask. You're being racist and apathetic because of a joke.

84,51,There are too many problems that it should be banned from public discussion in this sub.
86,51,"People aren't going to go to a doctor for a week and not get vaccinated. This is not what people want, you can just go with your gut."
92,51,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
93,51,"As a narrator who has written a lot of book books, it sounds like a lot of things you have been saying, as a child. Isn't the book a joke?"
94,51,I was told once by a black man on the internet that the NSA could have been running around on his phone to make the NSA feel better about what he was doing because he didn't like it.
51,2,"It is really a joke that you can make funny jokes about, but there is a lot more to it than just being a troll."
51,5,"Vaccines are illegal, but the NSA isn't doing anything about it."
51,8,It's not a joke. This is a real issue. It's about the slurs and the shit they say.
51,15,Is it a joke?
51,17,"What is this joke about? It is not about vaccination, it is about being a racist. It is about trying to prevent people from getting them. It is about not trying to make a joke about a legitimate threat. It is not about a joke. It is about the threat to a community."
51,33,"I have some serious issues with my CDC. Isn't it the best way for a doctor to get you vaccinated? Because I'm afraid that it's not possible for the doctor to do it, and that we should get the same treatment."
51,35,This is a joke. I don't want to be the first person to say that.
51,37,They need to tell the government what they say about a CDC joke about AIDS.
51,38,Vaccines are illegal.
52,51,Vaccines are most people's responsibility and not everyone's right to be vaccinated.
56,51,"I don't see what the problem is with the joke, but the joke is about the government."
57,51,The point of a vaccine is not to prevent the spread of the disease. It isn’t a joke. It’s a joke.
58,51,AMA is the 'worst thing I've ever seen'. The AMAs and jokes get pretty dang funny.
61,51,"I was in a movie about an anti-AIDS epidemic, and I got a bunch of comments saying ""I don't think there is a problem with putting on a mask or not."
84,51,"So is the issue about ""Why not""? What does ""I don't know what mask mandate is,"" do, ""but I just want to make sure my bf doesn't get shit?"" and ""What the government thinks of this?'"""
86,51,"Vaccines are supposed to help prevent spread of a virus, but the whole AMA is about preventing it."

93,51,You've made a joke. What's the difference?
94,51,"I think the NSA is making a great joke about the situation, and it is very clever. I think it would be very interesting if you said something like, ""My skin is dirt and my nose is red. It makes me uncomfortable but I've never worn my mask so I don't feel like I should wear them."
51,2,>I think that it's a good idea to take the mask and get vaccinated for those people who have the virus and take a helmet.
51,5,I was one of the first people to say that it was really a joke about the CDC.
51,8,It is an issue that's not related to anything. This article is about what they think the government needs to do to keep people safe. The AMA is the worst thing I've ever seen.
51,15,"I was actually doing a post on this subreddit a few weeks ago about how Americans shouldn't get vaccines in their homes because of sexist jokes. I was just thinking about getting a mask in front of the doctor, because you see you don't like that part of it, but the fact that you wear it while you're vaccinated helps."
51,17,I was reading the comments because of something different from a joke.
51,33,Vaccines are not illegal because they protect against all types of viruses.
51,35,I thought the name a bit misleading.
51,37,"I mean, what you are saying is true, but the fact that you are a guy wearing a mask is still very odd. People in the US can see that if the CDC goes ahead and tells someone to get vaccinated a different one they can make it look like they're taking care of the CDC to fight AIDS."
51,38,I didn't mean to be a troll.
52,51,"If you want to know that people don't get the vaccine in this situation, you need to know that the government is not going to fix it. I know they don't care, but if they aren't, they might be too stupid to do it."

92,51,The fact that you want to get a free and unharmed vaccine for your hands is just one of the most stupid jokes I've ever read.
93,51,The movie is not a ripoff of the book. The book is based on the book. The movie is based on the book. A lot of people are not comfortable wearing a mask to stop a virus.
94,51,"No one is making a joke, the NSA doesn't exist. The government is trying to take their message from us and i would think a real one would."

93,51,"I'm an author, and I know a lot of people who are rip offs of the book because the stories are based off of the book. It's based on the book. It was a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book, but the movie is based off of the book. It's based off the book."
94,51,"I've written several articles on this, and have heard the following stories about the CIA's attempts to get rid of HIV."
51,2,"You sound very, very uninformed. I don't want to be a jerk, but the CDC is trying to make a joke."
51,5,'You don't like wearing a mask outside while vaccinated? The CIA is a criminal organization and the NSA has no authority to do anything about it.
51,8,Why are we so incredibly anti - AIDS and anti-vaccination obsessed?
51,15,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is not a joke.
51,17,"The article that he is talking about isn't actually a joke. It's a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of HIV. That's a joke about the government, and it's also about the people being stupid and taking advantage of them. It's like saying... you're just talking about people, and you're just making a joke?"
51,33,The CDC is trying to make it illegal. They need to do what's necessary to stop the spread of the virus.
51,35,"Not a lawyer, not a doctor, not a doctor, and I'm not saying 'vaccination' is a joke, but it's a joke. I think it's important to recognize the distinction between 'vaccination' and 'vaccination' because it's a joke."
51,37,"It is a joke, but a joke, even if they don't do a ripoff of the book, that's a joke."
51,38,“I think it's pretty funny”” (http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/drug-fe-vaccination.htm)(http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/drug-fe-vaccination.htm)(http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/drug-fe-vaccination.htm)[http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/drug-fe-vaccination.html>(http://
52,51,What do you think the government has been trying to make up?
56,51,">The CDC, in this case, is making a joke about the AIDS crisis he was in and is getting sick, and is trying to fuck them."
57,51,"A lot of people don't know what vaccinations are, and a lot of people in the US don't know what they are."
58,51,"You should definitely see a doctor before you read the whole thing. It will be a long time before the people who are not vaccinated will realize that it's a joke and will inevitably become a joke. If it's a joke, then you shouldn't be vaccinating people, because it's not about the government."
61,51,"A friend of mine wore a mask, and it was pretty funny. He said that it was a joke because it was the joke."
84,51,It's not about whether or not the government is going to make it illegal. It's about whether or not the CDC is going to make it illegal to make a mask mandate.
86,51,"I would say they're about stopping the spread of the virus and not making an effort to control it themselves. The joke is about preventing TB and in fact, is a joke."
92,51,I was wondering why it's a joke?
93,51,This is a ripoff of the book.
94,51,"I'm on a mission to find a place to live in the future where people can safely get to a doctor and get help for the symptoms of a particular disease, not to be a joke to them. It's the only way you can get that help. And there's nothing wrong with that."
51,2,"I'd say it's not a joke, but they are trying to make it legal. The CDC is not going to make it illegal."
51,5,I think the only way to stop it is to go down to the doctor.
51,8,"""If you think it's a joke, then I'm making a joke and this is an excuse to make a joke about it""."
51,15,"That doesn't change the fact that the CDC has said that it is illegal to make a 'joke' about something that is not really a joke, like a joke about an NSA attack on a US citizen and that there's a lot going on."
51,17,"Is a mask not required by law for all people? If so, do not wear it. That doesn't make the article a joke."
51,33,I'm going to write a bunch of different things.
51,35,Vaccines are not legally required because they protect against all types of viruses. Vaccines are not legally required because they protect against all types of viruses.
51,37,"The book is based on fact, not facts. This was written by a female, not a man."
51,38,"As a doctor who has been in the same situation with the CDC, I can confirm that a few things aren't exactly common. It is called ""Psytopia"" and if you haven't read the entire article, the CDC doesn't have anything to hide, so it's not very easy to tell them what's going on. You've mentioned CDC and I'm sure there are some things there which could be used, IMO."
52,51,"People getting sick while running around on the sidewalk. They don't have the right to be a doctor and they don't have the right to be a pharmacist or to wear a mask on a run. It's a joke because people who do it are frightened, but I wouldn't mind being called out on it. [Making a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. [Ding, ''Is it really a joke?'' is an AMA"
56,51,"I can't believe there was a CDC article on this topic, but you could easily have found it. It's a little misleading, but it's not a joke."
57,51,There is a funny AMA about something and I'm going to give you a few points on it:
58,51,"AMA is a joke. It's about the government and spreading viruses around, in order to make people uncomfortable. AMA is about protecting people from HIV. AMA is about preventing the spread of viruses, so it's not about shaming the entire country."
61,51,I think the joke was a joke because it is actually a joke.
84,51,I'm a CDC employee with a raging AIDS epidemic and have never had any kind of infection with a mask.
86,51,They are about preventing the spread of the virus.
92,51,I think he's getting some point from the whole thing...I can't remember what the joke was but I just want to make it clear: the government doesn't want to vaccinate people.
93,51,">I don't really care if it is a ripoff of the book, or why people think it is a ripoff of the book."
94,51,I don't think we need any other way to deal with this.
