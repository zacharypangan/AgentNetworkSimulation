36,26,"It's a little strange that a pandemic like this exists, so many of those people in our country are already committing all types of AIDS. The government's main purpose is not to help people, but to make them sick."
39,36,"OP I like the idea of going out in public with a fat lip in, but I have never felt a better than a mask i wear."
40,36,"The rule is based on the law of the land, not on anything governmental related or otherwise. It would be nice if I knew something related to health care that happened here in the states or even here in Canada that would be considered ""antiviral."""
52,36,"It's not that they should be willing to take a slap in the face in a cold, it's that the mask needs to be worn."

74,36,"You say that your doctor will remove the virus from your face, yell at people and take you to the hospital, and you will know this."
75,36,You know what? That's not a pandemic. This is one of those things that the governments don't care about. Especially since they don't realize the dangers of pandemics. You are not going to get a response.

93,36,"It's been a long time since I remember it. In Canada, the first two years of running was when santa and santa first started putting the mask on. They used it for so much more than just a long run. Then when santa was finally done he put on the mask and put on the mask."
97,36,That is why I think it is useful to wear a mask to stop a virus. It helps the public know what's going on in the world.

40,36,It seems like they were really only trying to stop some shit from spreading.
52,36,"The hsvm program has a huge effect. Getting sick is the fad, not the real issue. It doesn't seem like there is something inherently wrong with that. The most obvious example is that people who are infected don't really know what to do, since they know that they are infected because their bodies have evolved from the virus."
68,36,My husband is in a welder's mask and is a welder at 11 and the problem with that is that I'm afraid of children getting sick from a virus and not have vaccinated.

We need to be prepared to run on peoples hands, if I are to get sick, I need to yell at people and take them to a hospital and the doc will see that I must be a bad person or else he may not be there. We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
75,36,You can wear a mask outside and you can't help them. People in the US are so afraid that this kind of exposure is going to make them sick.
81,36,Is this the one you want to see on TV?
85,36,"This has nothing to do with ""i wear a mask"" a lot."
89,36,There are two ways to go about it.
93,36,It's a good joke but it doesn't change the fact that a santa doesn't wear a mask at all.
97,36,A prick with no idea what a prick is. I mean I'd like to have one. But it's not a very good idea. People have to see if they're going to be able to stop themselves because they don't.

36,12,What's a good joke? A bad joke? The article isn't accurate ie the fad - not the true issue but the general shit - it's not a joke and we should never try to fix it.
36,26,"The virus that they put on your hands is spreading. And that's why you wear a mask to stop it, because that's the way it is spread, not for your own sake."
39,36,I think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.
40,36,"I'm in Florida, and we have a very long history of wearing a mask."
52,36,"""... and the people in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't wear it in public because of the risk."
68,36,I wear a mask to prevent people from getting sick from a virus and not have vaccinated.
74,36,> Vaccines are not what the government wants.
75,36,"I am not saying the government has a right to be concerned about pandemics but they do. We have the rights to be concerned about it. This is not a joke, it is a joke."
81,36,I love the show. I'm a neocon conservative and I'm in the mood to watch it again.
85,36,"Yes, you will be the first person to take out a virus."

93,36,I've heard people describe a few things I've observed in this sub:
97,36,"I just don't understand what you mean if someone is attempting to imply the government's actions will stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. You are a prick :) I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban."

39,36,I don't know about fl; I think there's a good chance you'll find some people that can take the vaccine without being harmed. I guess I'll stick to something like that.
40,36,This is an entirely different issue.
52,36,"Well, as for how you're going to go about dressing up as Santa, it's a little less appropriate."

81,36,"The guy who made the poster that said ""Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to be vaccinated."" It's actually a pretty big joke, considering the way he speaks. I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask. That's why they wear them. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. I think this is a great joke."
85,36,"I was a little confused as to why this was made, then I looked at the comments to see if there were any other versions of it, and that's the one."
89,36,Why is this a petty title? The whole petty title is just a funny title. I don't know what to do with it.
