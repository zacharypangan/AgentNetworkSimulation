73,52,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
75,52,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
76,52,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
86,52,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
92,52,i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere
93,52,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
52,1,I know. We've got a a statewide mask mandate... I just don't want to be put in a mask.
52,3,"A tumblr post that ends with ""Uh huh huh """
52,6,"...and to go out, isn't there another part of the story that is relevant?"

52,17,"I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."
52,19,I have a friend who has a virus that is not gone and she would like to wear a mask. Despite the fact that she doesn't wear a mask.
52,22,We don't have to wear a mask when we are not exposed.
52,25,It would be nice if we were all wearing a mask.
52,26,They're not trying to.. but the government is trying to encourage people to be more aware of what is going on in their homes..
52,27,"I think that is how it works. In other words, if you have a mask, you must wear it on when you get home from work or something."
52,28,"My boyfriend has a virus that has remained largely invisible since he was a young girl in Florida, so he isn't much of a freak."
52,35,I don't see how we are getting it. There's no guarantee that someone would get it. This would be a huge relief.
52,36,yea its not like they are willing to take a slap in the face in a cold.

52,45,i think you gotta wear a mask to the party
52,46,It was great talking to you yesterday but you seem to be putting too much pressure on the president to enforce the mask mandate. It just sounds like a terrible excuse.
52,51,I agree. This is really stupid. It explains why a lot of people get sick in their lifetime. But in general I don t think there is a right or wrong way to stop it.
60,52,People are sick. Many people wear a mask to protect themselves from spreading a virus.
73,52,I am going to try to tell you the truth about how my state isn't on this list. We should go. We should also be able to be as good of a voter as possible.
75,52,This is not the first time a post has gotten this far...
76,52,"A good guy in a bad situation is one who was wearing a mask to avoid a virus that he was taking out. He was walking out a window and he fucked himself in the face with the virus. He is wearing a mask to keep the virus from spreading, but he cant actually see the virus."
86,52,"I’m not sure what it is if you don’t have a mask, or don’t wear it as a mask if it is a helmet. I’d rather wear one of the masks on and wear it outside than in the closet."
92,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,52,"> and more importantly, 'it's good to make people think about themselves and they're really the only people'that could have done better."
52,1,The reason I haven't tried to wear a mask is because it's a good thing that we can be so nice to people.
52,3,And it's like a doctor told you to put on a helmet and not a cloak.
52,6,"So, he wants a mask to help the government fight the spread of viruses?"
52,7,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."
52,11,This is something I think I would rather hear. But I think it should be an issue of privacy.
52,15,"""We wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."""
52,17,People can't just wear a mask and do a bad job with the state.
52,19,"I have an extremely nasty cold. And my friend is infected with it too, so I'm wearing a mask every day to keep her warm."
52,22,">And more importantly, 'it's good to make people think about themselves and they're really the only people'that could have done better."
52,25,"It's funny you think people are too afraid of things in general that aren't very likely to be fixed. That's true of people whose homes they're in. A friend of mine has a virus that's already in her life. The doctors don't always notice when they see his mask or his eyes unless they are absolutely certain that it's out in the open and he's really scared because he doesn't want to risk his life, even though they may be sick. I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask"
52,26,"You don't know how it works, and that is exactly the reason we have it."
52,27,It's a nice idea to have a mask that s more than enough to get people to think about themselves and they're really the only people that could have done better.
52,28,A screamer on the computer. It's the anti-viral bill. That's the sort of thing that can't be ignored in these kind of places.
52,35,I just wanted to add that I am in the midst of a debate over a topic where the government has been trying to push to bring people out of the black hole and to make sure it is going to work.
52,36,"It's not that they should be willing to take a slap in the face in a cold, it's that the mask needs to be worn."
52,40,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I know this will have a good effect on your health, but you will always have to wear a mask."
52,45,I don't think there's a right or wrong way to prevent the spread of a virus.
52,46,"If you don't have a mask, you don't have a right to be on it. It's more important than the fact that people don't have to wear it. And it's not something I can say with certainty, because it's pretty common in America. That's just the way it is."
52,51,There is a different reason why people get sick than those who're not wearing a mask.'
60,52,Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please
73,52,"It is a very valid and enforceable part of the legislation in the state of California, and the statewide mask mandate would be the most important piece of legislation ever."
75,52,"I'm not blaming anyone but those who've been in the news for decades and were in the hospital recently because they were sick from pandemics. If you think someone is going to get sick from a pandemic, they are probably thinking that people who aren't going to be vaccinated should go. It isn't a pandemic and it does seem like you have an autoimmune disorder."
76,52,It's all about you.
86,52,"... and the people in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't wear it in public because of the risk"
92,52,This is not a joke.
93,52,Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,1,"I don't know why you are so enraged but I think that's a good thing because you can be nice to people. Using the screamer in the computer is a big enough problem to be solved in one hand but in the other hand, the virus is so small that there's not much to see in the world (and I don't know how to do that) but it would probably help with less panic and stress and a better way to deal with an infection that would have happened if they didn't have to wear it."
52,3,"I'm not blaming anyone but those in the news, but it's a good idea. People can't just wear a mask and do a bad job with the state."
52,6,"I think a lot of people are blaming the government for it, in order for them to make the laws in place to stop spread of this terrible virus."
52,7,"People in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't even get it in public because of the risk."
52,11,I don't think they are doing anything about that - the issue is that people in these situations can't be protected.
52,15,"The idea that people are blaming the government is absurd and ridiculous, and I'm trying to imply that you don't realize that? I'm actually very good at that. It's almost like you are saying the government is trying to make people feel better and is doing good work."
52,17,A mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,19,"This is not a joke. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.People can't just wear a mask and do a bad job with the state.

52,25,You're not stupid. They're really vile.
52,26,"In California, wearing a mask and bend over is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.People can't just wear a mask and do a bad job with the state."
52,27,That's pretty much my stance on it. People can wear their mask on a run.
52,28,It's all about you.
52,35,... I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask
52,36,"The hsvm program has a huge effect. Getting sick is the fad, not the real issue. It doesn't seem like there is something inherently wrong with that. The most obvious example is that people who are infected don't really know what to do, since they know that they are infected because their bodies have evolved from the virus."
52,40,"i'm just trying to give the people on here something to think about, and to tell them it should be a piece of legislation to be able to protect against the spread of a virus that isnt gone"
52,45,"There is a great debate on this subreddit about how people can wear a mask on a run to help prevent the spread of a virus, but it seems to me that it's not a joke."
52,46,I was in a medical school in california and I thought it was a great idea to put out a'mask'.
52,51,So I said that there is a difference because of that.
60,52,...and it's actually a really good idea to put a mask on after a while.
73,52,... the State is bringing a new policy. The state is bringing a new policy.
75,52,"Well, I gotta say that this guy is trying to be more eloquent about pandemics than it is about the fact that there are pandemics."
76,52,"This is also part of the definition of the term 'virus', because as a person with the Virus, we generally don't know what the actual term means. We know you aren't the person who causes the infection. If you are the person who causes it, and you don't, we don't know what the actual definition of 'viruses' is. We know the definitions, but you know your limitations and you're not aware of that definition."
86,52,"...and the people in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't wear it in public because of the risk Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There's a lot of science to be found about vaccines."
92,52,"Yes, this is a joke. You have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."
93,52,"IANAL. But santa doesn't wear a mask in the middle of his run. The only people in the community who do it, and the people who do it. The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they're doing something like 'Mom'."
52,1,"I'm in an emergency room. I go to the dentist and go to my nurse. I don't know what to do, but the doctor is supposing that my doctor is on my side and that I was wearing my mask for fear of getting infected."
52,3,Isn't it a bit of a troll in an attempt to make you uncomfortable?
52,6,"This is a very common, controversial issue, and it's certainly relevant to the discussion."
52,7,This isn't a joke. It's a misunderstanding.
52,11,"In California, putting a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
52,15,"OP, you're stating an entirely different set of facts."
52,17,"And I just wanted to say, you know how the ""Father of All Time"" works? It's the only one who wears a mask in the middle of a run? It's like they just aren't trying to help in case you're sick."
52,19,"A couple weeks ago, my husband did a video with a man who was at the hospital. He told the hospital that it was really cool and wanted to take the man home but couldn't because he wore his mask in the middle of the run. He said it was just too cold for him to be wearing his mask at the time."
52,22,"Yes, that's a joke. But santa doesn't wear a mask in the middle of his run. The only people in the community who do it, and the people who do it."
52,25,"I don't think there's anything wrong with a mask on a run and then wearing it in public, but that's a pretty big'mock' that doesn't go away until after the next day."
52,26,"I'm going to take a word for this, but it's about the reversible use of the term 'viral,' and the fact that there is a difference between the definition of 'viruses' and 'vaccination'."
52,27,"I'm a pharmacist, but this is a joke. They have a very real reason to wear a mask in the middle of their run."
52,28,"""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. """
52,35,"You are right if you can't do a good job of being a pragmatist, but it's not that stupid to wear a mask because it makes people sick. Those people need to understand how health care works, but what it is they need to be able to do to prevent sickness is just not the way it is. I'm a patient, and if someone is sick and doesn't know what they're getting, they're sick. But I think the best thing you could do is to wear a mask."
52,36,"""... and the people in need are the ones who have to wear it to the doctor, and they can't wear it in public because of the risk."
52,40,"Having a doctor who has an extremely nasty cold is what makes you an infected individual, not a disease that can be treated through vaccines. If you're a doctor you've already mastered the art of dressing in a mask. I mean if your doctor is a doctor you don't want to vaccinate everyone. If a doctor doesn't want you to wear a mask they aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They don't think that you're vile."
52,45,So how are you supposed to go about dressing up as Santa? Because Santa's the person who wants the public to know.
52,46,"I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. It's an incredibly simple but very vile problem and you should have the full respect of the whole government, and the community at large."
52,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,52,"It's not just a joke, it's a fact. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense to everyone."
73,52,"If it doesn't help, we're going to be more afraid of that guy."
75,52,"I think the problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
76,52,Is the actual reason for the fear in the US? I'm sorry but I'm trying to go back in time to explain why I wear a mask because I don't want to be that people who are infected with it with the virus.
86,52,It's a pretty good idea to wear a mask.
92,52,"There is a lot of misunderstanding here. ""I want to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. I do not care about his mother's health. I care about the best interests of my children."""
93,52,"I don't see a joke in the OP. I don't understand why some of the people wearing masks are so quick to get hurt. I mean, if it was a joke like this, I'd be so angry at the person who made the joke."
52,1,>I haven't tried to wear a mask in the middle of a run? It's like they just aren't trying to help in case you're sick.
52,3,I'm so sorry this is all over r/policing and i'm genuinely sorry people are so afraid of santa and his health and the government is supposed to do their part in stopping it.
52,6,"> ""I don't want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone"""
52,7,"Having a nasty cold is what makes you an infected individual, not a disease that can be treated through vaccines."
52,11,i don't think they are doing anything about that - the issue is that people in these situations can't be protected
52,15,I'd make a better joke with a few friends.
52,17,"I'm not sure why someone would think that it was a joke, but the part about the government actually helping them stop the spread of a virus is not a joke."
52,19,A med student at a pharmacy... they did a quick research and got some good information that you could use to get people to wear masks in the middle of their runs.
52,22,"I'm going to rephrase this for you: ""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. If you're a doctor you don't want to vaccinate everyone. If a doctor doesn't want you to wear a mask they aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They don't think that you're vile."""
52,25,"OP: The problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
52,26,...and the only people in the community who wear a mask in the middle of the run.
52,27,"It's not a joke, it's a fact."
52,28,... that's a joke.
52,35,"I just wanted to add that I am in the midst of a debate over a topic where the government has been trying to push to bring people out of the black hole and to make sure it is going to work.', ""... I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask"", ""You are right if you can't do a good job of being a pragmatist, but it's not that stupid to say you should wear a mask""."
52,36,"Well, as for how you're going to go about dressing up as Santa, it's a little less appropriate."
52,40,"If you wear a mask in public, you get to keep the vaccine in the mouth and stop the colds in case of an illness."
52,45,"> I think the problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic. Is the actual reason for the fear in the US?"
52,46,"Because you don't have to be in the middle of a run, because it's cold outside."
52,51,People get sick while running around on the sidewalk. They don't have the right to be a doctor and they don't have the right to be a pharmacist or to wear a mask on a run. It's a joke because people who do it are frightened.
60,52,"The joke's a bit of a shill and I think it's not as shady as the other commenters. It's not really a joke, it's more like an actual fact."
73,52,"The ""Made in Texas"" policy."
75,52,Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.
76,52,"As someone who has no control over HIV, you need to be patient. The US is going to be one hell of a place."
86,52,"This is why people who are vaccinated are on a list that would make them not needing to go to the doctor, and not to the doctor who vaccinates you."
92,52,"So, here's a funny quote to make:"
93,52,"This is pretty much the only reason people wear a mask, especially in the'real' world of santa's face."
52,1,"This is a joke. It's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny."
52,3,"OP: The problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
52,6,"Well, as for how you're going to go about dressing up as Santa, it's a little less appropriate."
52,7,Not the only reason he's a shill.
52,11,"It's a funny quote that goes along with this. ""We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. If you're a doctor you don't want to vaccinate everyone. If a doctor doesn't want you to wear a mask they aren't interested in the fact that you are sick. They don't think that you're vile."""
52,15,I would try to do a funny joke.
52,17,"I know the guy who did it, he did it when he was in the military. I think he's been pretty blunt about it."
52,19,"In Texas, everyone needs to know about the problem. The doctors who know how to prevent pandemics cannot simply use that information. It's the only 'fucking' reason people do that and they're afraid."
52,22,That's why you don't have to wear a mask in public.
52,25,"It's a joke because people who are vaccinated are on a list that would make them not needing to go to the doctor, and not to the doctor who vaccinates them."
52,26,"That's not even a joke, it's the best idea to be a doctor or a pharmacist."
52,27,"Well, I'm in the midst of a debate over a topic where the government has been trying to push to bring people out of the black hole and to make sure it is going to work."
52,28,"Well, as for how you're going to go about dressing up as Santa, it's a little less appropriate."
52,35,"This is what santa needs to understand how health care works, but it is also not a joke."
52,36,I think the joke is a joke because people wear masks to stop it from spreading.
52,40,"The problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic. The problem isn't that people don't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic. The problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
52,45,No. We're just reiterating what the joke is and how people should not wear masks.
52,46,I'm sure you're not the only one who thinks that a mask is a joke in order to prevent pandemics?
52,51,So I am not surprised if this was the only thing you'd see if anyone were to tell you a joke?
60,52,"It sounds like the government has something to offer people, even if it is in fact a joke. The fact that people need to wear a mask in the car is a big red flag."
73,52,A state that makes a new mandate is not as important as Texas's.
75,52,">When I was younger, I remember wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because I had a cold. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be vaccinated, but I just did what was necessary to get my head in line, but I was feeling a bit uncomfortable when I wore a mask."""

52,7,"I don't care about you, the fact that they're making this joke is a joke. Unless the doctors are trying to prevent pandemics, they can't afford it."

52,3,What does the CDC want to do with this problem?
52,6,I have a friend who has had a friend who was ill in the past with a viral infection and he wore a mask and wore a mask on it while she was still sick. So he said that was a joke to him. And the doctor also said that the CDC was supposed to be able to prevent pandemics because he had been there for a while. I thought that was a great idea and I think they need to change their policy about making it mandatory to cover the mask on a fucking virus.
52,7,"I'm a doctor who worked for a government agency that started to research this. Apparently, the most common type of medical care is to get a mask that prevents the spread of an illness."
52,11,I don't know anything about the CDC's policies and strategies. If they did a mask on me I would have gotten sick. I'd not be able to go to the hospital because that's what you want to hear. If they didn't I would just not go to the doctor because I would be worried.
52,15,That is a serious question. The government is using the CDC to have an emergency situation and prevent a pandemic.
52,17,It's also about the idea that the government is trying to make a joke about a virus. It's not a joke.

52,7,"Despite some claims that they did not do so, I am not saying they do not have any idea why people would be worried about it. They do, however, provide a valuable service that is not a joke."
52,11,I think it's pretty ironic that the government of New York doesn't have any policies or strategies for vaccination.
52,15,"It's a joke, and I think it's a joke too."
52,17,"The government has to make a good point, as we know, about how to go about getting vaccinated and not having a face mask in the middle of a run, to help people who are sick."
52,19,Yes. This is a joke.
52,22,This is my favorite AMA of the entire day.
52,25,"""We are allowed to get a free and unharmed vaccination for my hands. They are not illegal. I mean, I would love to wear a mask everyday."
52,26,"""We are allowed to get a free and unharmed vaccination for my hands. They are not illegal."""
52,27,I think it's a funny thing to say. This is a joke. The government is trying to fix the problem. Vaccines are not just for keeping people healthy. They are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy.
52,28,I’m glad to hear it is a good idea. I think we have to give the CDC more powers than they do.
52,35,I know this is coming from a CDC staffer who recently got vaccinated for the flu and we have been able to help people in our field. I snorted the AMA because of that.
52,36,They are not going to give us a fucking free virus.
52,40,The CDC is not going to protect anyone from a disease by putting a mask on.
52,45,It's the CDC trying to use that joke to make the US government think like a jerk.
52,46,"Having been diagnosed with the virus is a problem in and of itself. It's not as if a vaccine prevents the spread of it. It's not like they just enact an anti-vaccination approach to prevent the spread of the virus. The first part is a pretty vile thing to have in the world, and it doesn't have to be a joke. The second part is a more serious one. You don't need to be a cdc employee to be a cdc employee. The most important part of this"
52,51,"I'm a CDC staffer, and I don't get why so many people wear masks. But they do have to be a mask for the public to get a good vaccination."
60,52,"I'm going to assume that most people here know what the word ""joke"" means. I'm pretty sure this is one of those jokes that's funny about the government, that it's a really good idea to put on a mask and bend over and then not a joke, like, ""Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please please don't have an excuse."""
73,52,It's the government's problem. That's just not my thing.
75,52,It is more than a joke. It is about the idea that people should not have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem. The whole thing is just a joke. It's more than a joke. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem.
76,52,I see the joke... they're not even going to stop the spread of the virus.
86,52,It's just that in this time of time vaccinating people isn't a good idea. It's not like they're trying to stop the spread of viruses or weed in our society. It's just a joke.
92,52,"If you can’t take one, you can’t even get one!"
93,52,"Is there a point where you think we're having a ""dark"" time?"
52,1,The idea that you don't need to go through a CDC patch and then have a medical doctor on your side is a ridiculous joke.

52,40,It's funny because it says the government is not trying to stop it. There is no way this is going to stop it.
52,45,I've always wanted to come out in a more eloquent way.
52,46,">The Government is trying to create a joke about women getting sick while running, the government is trying to make a joke about men not getting sick."

73,52,"The CDC has been doing this for a long time. This seems to be a good thing, but I don't think it would help."
75,52,I think they spelt the word joke out of the context of their AMA. The article was in response to the general opinion of people. It was not about pandemics and not pandemics.
76,52,"""I am not a doctor, but I work for a doctor's office. This sub is not about the CIA. I'm just trying to explain why I hate that word. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

86,52,"""That's an absolute gimmick. You’d expect the government to take it seriously and help people get healthy."""
92,52,"I've been in the U.S. for 5 years, and my grandmother didn't know that vaccinations were required in her state. I've told her to be a doctor. I know what I'm doing. I feel like I could not be more helpless about it."
93,52,The article is in the middle of a story about a guy wearing a mask every day. It is a ripoff of the book.
52,1,Vaccines are a joke. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,3,Is the CDC trying to make a joke about HSVM?
52,6,"I believe the article is about a guy in Florida who went to a doctor who said that he wore a mask. Apparently a lot of people were talking about the CDC, and the doctor said that they couldn't give him a doctor's license for this disease."
52,7,The whole thing just reminds me that I'm the CDC staffer at the CDC.
52,11,There's nothing the CDC has to make out of it.
52,15,"We use masks to keep people from being vaccinated. That's what a joke is. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases. That's true of people whose homes they're in. The most obvious example is that people who are infected don't really know what to do, since they know that they are infected because their bodies have evolved from the virus."
52,17,The CDC has a lot of shit to write.
52,19,It's a joke.
52,22,"As a health care professional, I can confirm that the CDC does not care what people see on the news."
52,25,"The CDC is trying to cut the government out of the job, and the CDC is attempting to make this a joke, the government is trying to make it a joke."
52,26,"Yes, it is a joke. But it is a joke. You are not a doctor, but you are a pharmacist. But you are a doctor. This is a joke. Vaccines aren’t a joke. They’re for the prevention of health issues. You’re just a joke."
52,27,Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy.
52,28,"The idea of having a joke is really about the government's own responsibility and responsibility to protect people who are infected. If they aren't doing that, then it is a joke."
52,35,The CDC is using a joke to attack people for being pragmatists and having a joke about people who are vaccinated. I think that makes sense.
52,36,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,40,"I mean, I've been in the US for five years. I've been getting a shot at HIV in my hometown. I've heard a lot about how the CDC is just trying to get a joke. I've always assumed they're bringing in a LOT of health information and medical care that people don't think is necessary. I don't see how they can tell you that the CDC is trying to rip the CDC off by using a sarcastic piece of advice."
52,45,Vaccines are primarily for the prevention of disease. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of health issues. You’re just a joke.
52,46,>The CDC is trying to make a joke about the HSVM vaccine. Is there something that I can do to change my opinion of HSVM?
52,51,>I have to go to the hospital and get vaccinated.
60,52,"> [In general, as a person who has seen viruses on my hand, I don't think a virus can be vaccinated because it's a ""tinker"" in my body. It's just an ""obvious"" thing to do. I was born in the 60s and was very ill and had no medical advice, so it's probably just a little funny to read the title. I don't think it's funny that he's using an AMA to make fun of the AMA."
73,52,"CANNOTANSWER: ''If a mask isn't a serious problem because it is dangerous to use it. It doesn't really matter that it is an infection that you cannot get. It's just part of the problem that you're being 'funny' and remorseful about that, because you're going to be dead by then."
75,52,"If people wear masks, they don't really think it's a joke. They think that it's a joke. Whether they like it or not, it's a joke."
76,52,"I have a feeling that while you don't think it's a good idea to wear a mask, you do have to be patient. You do have to wear it, or you don't."
86,52,"Vaccines aren't for everybody. If you are a doctor, you need to be vaccinated. Vaccines are for everyone. They are for everyone. The government is for everyone. The government is not for everyone."
92,52,"I am so sorry you don't understand the ""judgement"" of these jokes in the ACT."
93,52,It's a joke. The whole joke is a rip off of the book.
52,1,As a doctor I am aware of this. The CDC is using the joke in the ACT to make fun of the CDC and to get people to take precautions against vaccination. It is a joke and the CDC is trying to make it worse. They are not trying to have fun by doing it.
52,3,"People who don't like them have to wear a mask and still be vaccinated. There is a lot of people who are not vaccinated. It's a joke, I'm not saying the CDC is a joke, I'm saying that the CDC is attempting to make it a joke."
52,6,"I'm not a doctor, but I am sure that if you're sick and have a virus, you would love to see a doctor. And for the record, most doctors have had a CDC Vaccine (not a virus) and it's pretty hard to imagine that it would be such a joke, it would actually be just as easy as a med."
52,7,"Unless they're trying to cut the government out of the job, and the CDC is trying to make it a joke, the CDC is trying to make it a joke."
52,11,"That's what we call ""Hyperprotection"" in this situation. There are several reasons why the CDC doesn't provide vaccinations in a certain manner."
52,15,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,17,>The CDC is trying to make a joke. They’re mostly for the prevention of health issues. You’re just a joke.
52,19,A joke? Totally. I just don't see it happening.

52,26,In my experience the CDC is trying to try to do more and more than one thing: put the face on the person who has a virus.
52,27,"I know what you mean, but what is this joke?"
52,28,I am a lawyer in the United States. I am a lawyer in England.
52,35,"No, I'm a doctor, and I have a lot of job experience in the healthcare industry."
52,36,"In this instance, if you want to know how to tell the difference between what is normal and what isn't?"
52,40,"No one knows why the CDC is trying to get a joke about a vaccine. People can wear masks because they know they are safe. If they want to say something like, ""I am a doctor, and I don't have a virus, and I am a doctor, I will put on a mask. I have a virus that I don't have a virus, but that will probably make me sick. They don't want to hurt you."""
52,45,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,46,"The way he's being used is. What he's doing is blatantly racist and unfair. And yet he doesn't have to be a doctor to get the vaccine. If he wasn't on a mask, and the government is trying to make it a joke, and he's not making it a joke, then he's being racist and unfairly unfair."
52,51,Vaccines are most people's responsibility and not everyone's right to be vaccinated.
60,52,"""He's a member of the CDC and a hivemind. The fact he is wearing a mask means he's been doing this for years. He's probably a jerk."""
73,52,"I don't think that's a joke. I'm sure the CDC is going to give him a lot of support, but that's a bad situation."
75,52,"If someone tells me it isn't about pandemics, and I'm concerned that something might be wrong with me, I think it is a joke."
76,52,There are two types of people in this sub.
86,52,"A lot of these comments don't make sense, which is why I thought the AMA was an anti-vaccine joke."
92,52,I'm sure the CDC understands that the government needs to get on top of these things because it isn't in the right place.
93,52,"“But santa doesn’t wear a mask in the middle of his run. The only people in the community who do it, and the people who do it. The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they’re doing something like 'Mom’.”"
52,1,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,3,"The one guy that gets the'so much' joke is the guy who says 'fuck you', but that doesn't make it any less a joke. It's a ripoff of what was said. I don't think the CDC understands it's a joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke."
52,6,"""I just don't see it happening. I am a doctor and I think the government is the one responsible for the prevention of health issues."
52,7,"Despite some claims that they did not do so, I am not saying they do not have any idea why people are concerned about the risks."
52,11,"Yes! I hate to say it, but people who do it wear a mask for reasons they don’t actually care about. I don’t think the government is doing anything about it - they are trying to make a joke about it, and it’s not fair to them. Vaccines are a health issue and don’t necessarily cover all the problem."
52,15,"They're making a joke about the fact that if someone gets a flu and is vaccinated, they'll get a flu."
52,17,>I don't think that's a joke.
52,19,"I'm not sure where the phrase's ""This is not a joke"" comes from."
52,22,"There are very few examples of what an AMA AMA is. It was written with the intent that it was a joke, but the AMA was done to avoid an actual controversy and rename the AMA."
52,25,"I've heard stories of people who are not vaccinated because they are scared of sick people, or because they do not know what the problem is."
52,26,Because it's actually a joke.
52,27,I think that this post is very good and reflects my views on the issues in the US health care industry.
52,28,I'm a lawyer in the United States. I'm a lawyer in England. I do not have a job. I've been working for years in a health care company and I'm concerned about health issues that may come up in their office or in a private practice. I've had a job as a security guard for a while. I have been in my house for a number of years and can't remember which one of them was that he was an assistant with the agency?
52,35,"You are being sarcastic, but it is the right thing to do. If he has a mask on and is doing it because he is being a prick, it is not a joke. But he is making the joke, so it isn't a joke, a prank, or a joke."
52,36,"I’m gonna give you the whole story of this guy getting vaccinated with a mask. Then I’m going to say, “You’re a doctor, and I think the CDC is not the one to make a joke about that."
52,40,It's been a while since I've heard of that. I have a bit of a hard time believing the fact that I've been in the US for five years. I've been getting a shot at HIV in my hometown.
52,45,"Yes, it is a joke."
52,46,"""If you don't have a mask, you don't have a right to be on it. It's more important than the fact that people don't have to be on it. It's more important than the fact that people don't have to be on it."""
52,51,"If you want to know that people don't get the vaccine in this situation, you need to know that the government is not going to fix it. I know they don't care, but if they aren't, they might be too stupid to do it."
60,52,I know the joke and I know the joke. I never had a problem with it and it was a great joke.
73,52,"The issue isn't the state, it's the federal government. There are other issues, such as health care, which CDC does not support."
75,52,It seems to me that the whole thing is just a joke. It's about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics. It sounds like he was able to show his lack of experience that this is not the problem of the problem. The whole thing is just a joke.
76,52,"""I am not sure if you're being a dick at all, but a bit of a joke. I'm just trying to explain why we have to wear the CDC’s health system to prevent the spread of a virus.

People need to be vaccinated, but not for any other sex."", ""[[I have been in a lot of dangerous situations and the last time I wore a mask, [I can]"
86,52,People who don't have vaccinated are just going to go see the doctor. That's what the AMA is about.

93,52,"A lot of people are not comfortable wearing a mask to stop a virus. ""Hit-in-the-Little dick"" is a joke, and it makes me laugh. But 'I'm not sure I could go with that.' The movie ain't funny, it's just a joke. I've got some things for you."
52,1,You're very knowledgeable about this subject. It's a joke and it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke.
52,3,"CDC is trying to make the article a joke, but it's being rephrased. I'm going to give you the whole story of the guy who got a vaccinated with a mask."
52,6,That's what a doctor needs to do when people come into their offices.
52,7,"""Well, they’ve made it clear that you’re not a doctor and if you’re being a shill then 'I’m a doctor, if you are a doctor, you will never get a shot at AIDS."""
52,11,"We have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist. If you're a doctor you don't want to vaccinate everyone. If they don't want to vaccinate everyone."
52,15,"The issue is the federal government. Vaccines are not for the prevention of diseases, they are for the prevention of the spread of HIV."
52,17,A friend of mine did a “Fast Post” about HIV.
52,19,The article cites a CDC article that is about this being a rip off and a joke.
52,22,"No one will ever get vaccinated by this fucking joke. Unless there's a problem, it's not a joke."
52,25,"I had a raging vaccinate a few weeks ago, and was worried that the disease could be spread by going to a doctor without an injection."
52,26,"Vaccines aren't a joke, they're for the prevention of health issues."
52,27,">(Is a joke) about the government doing something to help people, not the health of the entire country."
52,28,They're also about the idea that the government should have the power to go ahead and do what it thinks is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.
52,35,"It isn't exactly a joke. There are other people who aren't immune to it, and that's what it is."
52,36,"""This is what santa needs to understand how health care works, but it is also not a joke."""
52,40,"I'm not sure if the article is funny or not, but it would certainly be funny if it was a joke. You'd be hard pressed to get your doctor to wear a mask if you're an infected person."
52,45,I'm not sure the best way to put it. It's kind of an immature and petty thing to do in order to make people think like that.
52,46,"AIDS is not the cause of the world, it's the cause of millions of lives. There are many reasons, from the virus to the vaccine, that people can become better."
52,51,I'm not really sure what you mean by 'the government's job'. But it's not the government's job to do that.
60,52,It's not a joke. I'm an atheist and I'm aware of the jokes. I'm not a fan of AMAs. It sounds like the AMA is really a joke.
73,52,"I am so glad I can get this message. I have been working on making a mask and it seems that we all have different perspectives about issues, and I am very happy with the outcome. My friend just wants us to be able to have a face to face conversation about what a mask is, what a policy it is, and how it affects us."
75,52,Is this a joke?
76,52,"I’m pretty sure the person who was trying to say it was a joke that said this has not been done in a public space. It may be a bit of a political joke, but I do agree with it. It’s not really about the CDC and it doesn’t seem like it has the right to do it. Rather a bit of a joke."
86,52,"That was pretty funny in my opinion! I don't know if the AMA has actually been a joke, but it is a funny, entertaining, and very very relevant piece."
92,52,As a doctor I can't remember the exact name.
93,52,"And it's not a joke at all. It's a ripoff of the book, a ripoff of the book. It's not a ripoff of the book."
52,1,It's a joke about how the government wants to get people to put in a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
52,3,I think this is a joke.
52,6,"The best part is that, as a patient, you have to put on your mask to keep the virus at bay."
52,7,You have been making a joke since you were a doctor?
52,11,"Vaccines are not a joke, they're for the prevention of health issues."
52,15,"A lot of the people in the story are probably wrong. I think it’s a joke, but it’s not a joke."

52,19,"I don't know where the phrase ""Jokes"" comes from, but that's it."
52,22,"A doctor should also be required to wear a mask when exposed. It seems like there's a ""prank"" being made in the headlines. The guy got the joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The article was a joke about the government in some way. It is not a joke."
52,25,It's like if it was a joke it would be a joke if I didn't know that the government would take away the government's job and try to make the joke.
52,26,"People just suck at it when it's the only thing they want to do. People don't need to buy their own stuff, and that's a joke to them, that's a joke."
52,27,"I'm not sure what you mean by joke? If this is a joke, but it seems like the joke is more about the government's job and that AMA isn't an AMA."
52,28,No joke. It's a joke.
52,35,"So, you have no idea how an AMA is intended to affect people? What you're saying in the article is correct."

93,52,It's an amazing ripoff. And you get some incredibly funny jokes on reddit.
52,1,People just suck at it when it's the only thing they want to do.
52,3,I’d rather keep a vaccinated person than have a doctor tuck their face into the trash.
52,6,The people who do this are the ones who do it. It's not about the government.
52,7,I’d like to point out the issue I am currently in. Obviously you’re getting a few jokes out of it. But the question that’s still being raised is about whether or not it should matter. The jokes are not funny.

52,6,The AMA is just a joke about the CDC. That's not a joke at all.
52,7,The question isn't whether or not this is a joke.

52,25,This is a joke. You don't want to take off your mask and just go to the doctor. This is a joke.

93,52,"I don't know what I'm saying, but I think that the part that makes the headline a little funny is the way it was written, because I'm sure that it's very plausible and I think it's a good way to do it, because it's a little eloquent and the book doesn't even matter."
52,1,It was written by a CDC volunteer who was the lead physician on a research project at the University of Texas at Austin. It's funny because you get sick from it.
52,3,The CDC has some serious problems here.
52,6,This is a joke. It's not about the government. It's about trying to make it illegal to put on a mask.

52,15,"No. No, not a joke. The entire story is about people wanting to get sick, and it's about people putting on the masks because they think it's hilarious."

52,26,"I have a theory that one of these people, by his actions, will have to suffer a severe flu to be vaccinated by the government. I'd say it's pretty ridiculous.

52,36,"Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases. The problem is that people are at the center of the pandemic. That's true of people whose homes they're in. In the UK, wearing a mask means that people can't go to the doctor or to the doctor without being infected."

52,45,. I'm not a doctor
52,46,I'm a doctor and I always think that's what a joke is a joke. I think it is pretty obvious. It's not about the vaccine.
52,51,I am a doctor and I have never gotten sick from wearing a mask on the sidewalk. So I've got to get out of the office to get vaccinated.

75,52,This makes the entire AMA sound like a joke. I don't think it's funny or a joke because it's sexist.
76,52,CANNOTANSWER EDIT: This sub is full of such funny posts and memes. This is like this:
86,52,"People are vaccinated. They need to get vaccines, and they don't need to get to the doctors."

93,52,"A ripoff of the book is a joke and the book is a joke. It is a joke, and the ripoff isn't really a ripoff of the book."
52,1,I would be worried if I was harmed by this kind of situation. My doctor is a physician who is involved in vaccine research in Texas. He is also involved in research on preventing pandemics and promoting people from getting sick from this disease.
52,3,"In the US CDC is not a federal agency. The CDC has an independent, state-backed agency that can administer all vaccinated individuals in a week or so. The only way they can provide vaccines is to make sure that vaccinated people have a proper treatment for the disease that is not infected."
52,6,The issue is that people would not voluntarily go to a doctor without getting infected.
52,7,"There are plenty of reasons why people wouldn't believe a joke about the CDC, because they're bringing in more patients and limiting access to medical care that's already been used. The most obvious one would be 'I'm not a doctor', I don't think you're making a joke.'"
52,11,"It's a joke. It's not just a joke, it's a joke."
52,15,"I think the most obvious example of that is that people who are infected don't really know what to do, since they know that their bodies have evolved from the virus."""

52,28,I don’t think 'jokes’ are sexist and not about anything in the AMA.

52,40,"Vaccination is a problem, which is why a lot of people who don't have a vaccine will choose not to vaccinate."

52,1,It's not a joke. It's not a joke.
52,3,I think the CDC is a joke that they need to stop infecting people with a vaccine and not just people who don't get one.
52,6,"As a physician, I can say that the worst part about wearing a mask is how if someone comes into contact with a virus, they become more likely to get infected than if someone just came into contact with a virus."
52,7,A ripoff of the book is a ripoff.
52,11,"CANNOTANSWER, MD : The CDC, who allegedly tried to fuck people in the media for making a joke about it, said they pushed vaccinations in a way they would do with public health, because it was a joke about people and not the people whose health was being affected."
52,15,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: The joke is being made in the US and I'm a CDC employee."
52,17,"In addition to the other issues you have mentioned, a lot of doctors are concerned that the vaccines will not have any effect on the patient's health. It may be more effective to have an AED than a flu shot, or have a shot at getting the vaccine without the AED, or that someone else has a virus."
52,19,">He said ""it's the only 'fucking' reason people do that and they're afraid."""

52,26,No one likes jokes in the US. They just like to keep people happy. The first part of this story is funny.
52,27,"In a nutshell, the headline is ""I'm not sure what a joke is"" and the subtitle says ""I'm a doctor. I'm not a doctor."""
52,28,"I'm not sure what the joke is, but I do know that people are saying it's a joke. It's actually called a joke in the AMA."
52,35,It's probably one of the most important parts of the story that the US government and the CDC have in common.
52,36,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ''I read this article about the government's job to stop the spread of a virus."
52,40,The jokes here aren't necessarily about vaccination or about what is being said.

52,46,"CANNOTANSWER, MD"
52,51,It's a joke and the government is trying to make it a joke.
60,52,What's funny is that the AMA was so far behind and has largely been unconfrontational to people.
73,52,>The only problem I have with the government is that people will become more violent if they don't wear them.
75,52,"So, it's the AMA, right?"
76,52,"People who don't get AIDS have a virus called HIV. In many cases, HIV doesn't spread as quickly. If HIV is spread from you, there is a low chance you will get it again."
86,52,>I think AMA is a joke
92,52,"I would argue that vaccination is a joke. I would say that in Texas you aren't required to be a doctor or a pharmacist to provide a vaccine, and the government isn't required to provide the vaccine. If you are not allowed to be a doctor, you are not required to be a doctor."
93,52,I was reading the book and I thought it was a ripoff of the book.
52,1,What is the difference between the first and second part of the joke? Is it really a joke?
52,3,So we can't have a joke about how I was actually the one who got the viral vaccine in the first place? I mean you know it's a joke. But yeah. I mean I got it right.
52,6,What's the point of a joke about the government if the public isn't aware of it?
52,7,"The AMA. It's a joke. There are a lot of people who believe a joke about the government. In fact, even the ones who think that it's a joke are actually being laughed at."
52,11,Why is this so funny? What does it say? Does the CDC care?
52,15,"Yes. In Texas you aren't required to be a doctor or a pharmacist to provide a vaccine. If you are not allowed to be a doctor, you are not required to be a doctor."
52,17,"""It's basically not a joke. It's a joke that's a joke. Is it really a joke?"""
52,19,I don't think the CDC is a joke.

52,26,A lot of these people are not doctors. 
52,27,>The only problem I have with the government is that people will become more violent if they don't wear them.
52,28,"This is the kind of thing that is a joke. The government is at fault for having this type of joke, and they're trying to make it as a joke."
52,35,It is actually called a joke in the AMA.
52,36,I don't really want to go to the doctor with this joke but what does this article say about santa? Do you know what it says about the guy who got sick and asked to go to the doctor?
52,40,"So it's funny to see the CDC go after the CDC for their own safety in the name of protecting against HIV from the general public? And then they have a joke about making a joke about using the CDC to prevent AIDS from spreading, but the CDC can't help by doing it because there aren't very many people who aren't already in the disease and they can't keep up with CDC policy."
52,45,I know what a cdc is. But the people in this subreddit are just as ignorant about this AMA as the CDC.
52,46,I can't imagine being a doctor or a pharmacist in the US without a mask?
52,51,It's a joke and it's a joke because people are being put in the position of a government official.
60,52,"I'm pretty sure it's about a joke about the government. I'm an atheist, and I'm aware of the jokes. It's a joke that's not about the government, but it's a joke about a joke."
73,52,[Which is an interesting thing about the story](http://www.naa.gov/statutes/indicators/gov.tx/statutes/statutes)
75,52,"It seems that you can make a joke, that's what it is."
76,52,I think the CDC has the right to apologise. It's the other way around. It isn't the CDC's right to do it. They're not just the government. It's the CDC's wrong.
86,52,"What the AMA is about is how the government uses their own propaganda. That is, they don’t care about the facts of the AMA. That’s the joke."
92,52,"The issue is the CDC is a joke, which is a joke."
93,52,"The guy who writes ""The Man in the Hat,"" compared to the movie ""The Man in the Hat"", was a joke. The book was a joke. It's a joke."
52,1,"CANNOTANSWER: [As someone who's worked in the US for a while, I can confirm that my apologies are in fact not as silly as a joke about the CDC."
52,3,So the point of the article is that if you read the headline you would know that people are being made to go into a higher path to health than you are.
52,6,"As a doctor, I can say that there's not enough truth in the article to stop people from making it about the government. If a doctor wants to stop spreading AIDS, it's time to stop."
52,7,Is it really that a joke? I'm not very good at the stuff.
52,11,We can't blame the CDC for the joke. I know that some people may want to get vaccinated and that some people don't.
52,15,That AMA is about a joke.
52,17,The article doesn't mention anything about the fact that the CDC doesn't want the patient to be infected without a mask. It mentions the fact that the guy who wrote the AMA didn't have a mask but was talking about a guy that didn't know he had HIV.
52,19,"I am not saying they should stop it, but we do not know what the ""Joke"" is. I am saying they should stop doing it,'so that they aren't getting better.'"
52,22,"It's a joke about a government policy designed to prevent the spread of the virus. It's basically a joke about the government, it's not a joke about the government."
52,25,The doctor I have had a friend in a medical field who got vaccinated told her she had a good chance of getting the flu and was worried about not coming to her doctor's office. She was so upset because she'd been told that it was an effective way to protect the public.
52,26,This is why the CDC is a joke. They are making a joke about how they fucking haven't actually fucked up any more. They are getting the idea out of the fucking CDC and causing a fucking epidemic.
52,27,I would be concerned about that.
52,28,I think the whole joke is very interesting because I'm not a doctor.
52,35,This is a very good joke. The CDC and the federal government are at fault for trying to make a joke out of it.
52,36,"""The best way to keep people healthy is to not worry about HIV and not give people any kind of treatment."", ""I don't really want to go to the doctor with this joke, but what does this article say about the guy who got sick and asked to go to the doctor?"", """
52,40,Is there any reason for a mask to get off in the public eye? Is it to keep people from getting sick?
52,45,The article is about how the CDC uses the government's own propaganda to try and make a joke about the people. The CDC can't make a joke about the government if there is no evidence for that.
52,46,"I don't like the word ""joke"" in the headline, but it's just something I'm interested in learning more about and finding more pertinent. I mean, I don't want to say it's a joke about the virus, but the joke is about the government. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
52,51,A guy in the AMA who screamed about the fact that people don't have a right to be a doctor is wrong.
60,52,I know this. I'm an atheist and I don't like the jokes.
73,52,It’s an obvious example of the government's incompetence. It’s an obvious example of the government's incompetence.
75,52,I can't really think of a better reason to be surprised at how funny a joke is.
76,52,"The CDC has a right to refuse the vaccination, and the government is not. It is the CDC, they are a party. They are the gov't. The CDC."
86,52,"I don't even like the idea of wearing a mask, the notion that you'd want the government to take care of them. Is the whole point of the AMA a joke?"
92,52,"The government needs to make it illegal, not legal."
93,52,"The title is very appropriate. As I said before, if a person had to make a joke for their own reasons a joke would have been a ripoff of the book, as opposed to a ripoff of the book, just like the ripoff of the book."
52,1,People eat the CDC. The guy who wrote the AMA doesn't have a mask.
52,3,">Isn't it a joke, since it's a joke?"
52,6,"We've seen the AMA. It's a ripoff of the book, as opposed to the AMA."
52,7,"I think this is a joke. I don't think it's a joke about the government, but its the kind of joke that makes people think a doctor shouldn't be a doctor because of their job. It's a joke that is only a joke because there's an article on it that talks about how people can have the virus even if they don't know if a doctor would do it. I don't think this is a good joke, but in my opinion it's a joke. It's a joke,"
52,11,The CDC isn't telling you how to handle the vaccination. The fact that the doctor who wrote it says the author's quote is about being infected by a virus that is not gone.
52,15,It's a joke. Having been vaccinated was never a joke.
52,17,AMA: It's a joke about a government policy designed to stop the spread of a virus.
52,19,"I'd rather just avoid the whole ""the government"" thing. That's how you have this discussion and have a serious discussion about a joke. That is what you want to hear and you have to talk to people about it."
52,22,"I am just saying to myself, ""I've got a lot of problems with this. This is my way of making sure I am not a virus person or a person I can get care for. I have to go and get vaccinated. This is not a joke, I'm not a doctor. This is a joke. This is a joke about the government, the government doesn't care about what people see on the news. This is what the CDC needs to make out of the article? I am a doctor, I know that"
52,25,"We should probably ban this kind of treatment for people who can't get it, but don't know what it's used for or have a proper medical history."
52,26,You're not really the joke. This is a very interesting joke.
52,27,"What's more, this is a joke about the government and the fact that it has been using propaganda to stop HIV/AIDS to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
52,28,... I am so sorry.

52,35,I read the AMA on the morning of the 5th and found it to be a joke. It makes it sound like they are going to make a joke and they are going to have a joke.
52,36,What is the title of the AMA?
52,40,"CDC, the government, and the public are all responsible for prevention. Not all of them are bad.

93,52,Is this a true story? I don't understand the OP's response at all. I'm not sure if I can be of more assistance. Is there an example where I'm too afraid to wear a mask? I'd be a little scared.
52,1,"I think it's funny to put on a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. I'm not sure if it's real, but I think it might be funny, if they made a joke about the CDC."

52,3,My friend's dad told a story about how his girlfriend got a flu shot. I thought it was really funny that he wasn't aware about the symptoms.
52,6,"As a doctor who was diagnosed with HIV after a few months of using the CDC's system, I can tell you the best way to keep the conversation around this is to read through the whole story and try to figure out where the problem is. This is really a good, fucking joke."
52,7,Is there a way to get that on your brain? Because I can't find any.
52,11,I think the first two are both hilarious.
52,15,I was the guy with the HSVM in the article and I couldn't understand his reply.
52,17,"A couple of weeks ago a guy told me he was in a sex scene. One of the things he said to me is, ""If you don't want to be a doctor"" and it wasn't a joke, I just say ""Hey, I thought I was a joke. I thought I'd tell you something. I'm just not sure. The article 'Cannot agree with your opinion.'"
52,19,he's not a doctor and does not have a doctor's license.
52,22,"It seems like the CDC wants to go as far as removing that point. It's an attempt at skepticism and the AMA should be written so people can understand the point, and what it's going to say to them is a joke."
52,25,"So if you're not a doctor, are you still a doctor? You're not. You're in a different country. The only exception I can think of to all the jokes about the government that they make in their own country is not getting sick or getting sick. You can be vaccinated."
52,26,"I'm a pharmacist, I wear a mask and it makes me sick. I'm not a doctor but I can't help but wonder why people are scared of that kind of thing when they're already infected."

52,36,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of diseases.
52,40,Are you aware of what the CDC wants to make out of the article?
52,45,"This hasn't been a big topic for a while but a new study uncovered a potential hazard for the people who don't have a doctor's license that will cause problems in the future. So many people still aren't a doctor, or a doctor at all, despite being very familiar with the topic."
52,46,"The government is trying to stop HIV from spreading, so the AMA is a joke, not a joke. It's going to be pretty obvious. And it's a joke, not a joke, but it's a joke, because it isn't actually a joke."

60,52,What I see as being a joke is that there is a government. If I was a doctor I would do the AMA. But the joke is also funny because I don't like the joke.

86,52,"The AMA isn’t about vaccines. It’s about people who are vaccinated. They need to get vaccinated. People who are not vaccinated. If you aren’t a doctor, you need to be vaccinated. Vaccines are for everyone. If you are not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor."
92,52,"I'm a doctor and I get a lot of jokes. In fact, when I wrote this, it was a joke."
93,52,The movie is not a ripoff of the book. The book is based on the book.
52,1,"A bunch of people are complaining about the CDC. It's the CDC, it's not."
52,3,You are all so out of shape and I think you're going to have to work with me to get vaccinated if you think this is a joke.

52,17,This is a joke. You are an idiot.
52,19,"No, not at all."
52,22,"“Pretty sure, it’s a joke that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV. But the government has a right to make a joke about it.”"
52,25,Vaccines are the main 'go to' in the USA if a person with HSVM screams about a vaccine and the government is doing a joke about it.
52,26,"So I'm trying to make a joke about people getting sick from a mask. The CDC is trying to make a joke about this, but the author isn't attempting to do so. The article essentially says it's the CDC's job to 'prevent the spread of the virus,' and it's in the context of the AMA. They're trying to make a joke about the government, but to do so in the context of the AMA, they need to make a joke, or some other way."
52,27,Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy.
52,28,I feel the same way. Alot of the jokes are about the government. It’s not a joke about a guy who was getting sick from a virus. It’s about a guy who was getting sick from a virus. Vaccines are for the prevention of diseases. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of health issues.
52,35,"I think I understand your concern. It's just that it is the only way to get people into a healthy health care system. It's not funny, it's just not fair that people don't care enough about what's going on around them. It's just that people have no idea how things work and the joke is a bit of a cliche."
52,36,"the CDC is trying to be politically correct, and not skepticism."
52,40,"As a doctor who was in a sex scene with a guy who didn't believe he was a doctor, this is a joke that is used by the CDC to put in a piece of legislation that focuses on public health. This is basically a joke about the CDC and is a joke about how it's a joke to use the CDC to get rid of a dick joke."
52,45,That would make me mad because I was a doctor to people who never really believed anything like that was going on. I thought it was a joke but I don't like it.
52,46,Vaccines are for the prevention of diseases.
52,51,Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of health issues. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of health issues.
60,52,"In general, as a person who has seen viruses on my hand, I don't think it's a joke. AMAs are about the government, not the people. AMA's are about preventing the spread of a virus, but about the government's role in the pandemic. Vaccines are legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. AMA's are about the government. AMA's are about the government, not about the people."

52,3,What is the 'funny' joke in this post? I was in a sex scene with an infected man with HSVM and I heard it's a joke. So I have the mask in my pocket. This joke is about the CDC trying to make a joke about the CDC.
52,6,"In the US, doctors are allowed to get the free and unharmed vaccination for their hands. They are not illegal."

52,19,"he's probably getting his md. 'cannot think of a better reason to be mad,"
52,22,"So the CDC wants to ban the face masks. It's basically the idea that it's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus, that it's a joke and not the government?"
52,25,"I think the humor in this post is not so funny, but rather a little less funny."
52,26,"Yes, that's a joke, but it doesn't make any sense. Vaccines are mostly for the prevention of health issues."
52,27,I was not aware of the comment before I read this.
52,28,"People who want to be sick from a virus are going to go to the doctor, go to the doctor and get vaccinated. People who want to go to the doctor or get vaccinated are going to go to the doctor and get vaccinated, go to the doctor, go to the doctor and get vaccinated. This is not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
52,35,"I had a very similar reaction. I had some jokes about people vaccinating but didn’t really have much experience with them. My husband had a vaccinated teen, and they wouldn’t let him eat or drink because of my dick. It was just a prank. I don’t think anyone at all would take the time to read it. He had to get him tested for an infection in his face for about a month before he ate or ate. I had a few days before he woken up, I was"

52,25,"It's one thing to make people wear a mask because they don't get sick because they have the virus and a mask to protect them and if they don't, the doctor won't get sick if they aren't vaccinated."
52,26,"The problem is not that you are a doctor, but that you think it is a joke, and they are trying to make it a joke about the government. It is a joke that the government is trying to make up. This isn't a joke, it is about the government being the joke."
52,27,"I think this is about the government and all of the problems they are having here. They have a responsibility to take care of people, even if it is in the name of the law."
52,28,AMA is a joke.
52,35,"It's been mentioned in the AMA that a CDC spokesman who said he didn't know what a CDC joke was was ""It's not a joke, but it's not a joke."""
52,36,">It’s a joke. The CDC has a much more powerful role to play in this regard, and as long as people who are already sick can't go to the doctor, and they can’t do that."
52,40,"I'm not sure if the AMA is a joke, but what I'm saying is that it's a joke. A lot of people are defending the CDC's policy to stop the spread of AIDS, and a lot of people are defending the AMA. 'They're just trying to make a joke'', but they aren't really trying to make a joke. It's really important. They're putting in more effort than necessary, and if they don't want to do, they're trying to"
52,45,I would say that this sub is a joke in a nutshell.
52,46,If you have a mask and you're vaccinated he has a right to do so. If he doesn't you can't have it. The AMA is just about the government causing the pandemic and is not a joke. And this AMA is about the government making a joke about the government's role in preventing the spread of a virus.
52,51,"People getting sick while running around on the sidewalk. They don't have the right to be a doctor and they don't have the right to be a pharmacist or to wear a mask on a run. It's a joke because people who do it are frightened, but I wouldn't mind being called out on it. [Making a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. [Ding, ''Is it really a joke?'' is an AMA"
60,52,"I don't know. You could say that, but you were a joke about the AMA, but you are an atheist."
73,52,>(http://www.naa.gov/statutes/indicators/gov.tx/statutes/statutes) is an interesting article. It's an interesting and relevant subreddit. I recommend you check it out /r/politics for more information about the article.
75,52,AMA is about the idea that people shouldn't have a right to be concerned about pandemics.
76,52,"Alot of people are just being honest and being truthful about how their 'I don't know what a mask is' joke, and how they're the government is doing it."
86,52,"A doctor doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. It's the government's job to help them. You don't get the benefit of the doubt, you get the benefit of the doubt. It's a joke. You are a doctor."
92,52,"CANNOTANSWER, MD, a doctor from a U.S. school, has a quote that explains how people make fun of the CDC because they're the only people in their school to know that a joke is a joke."
93,52,"It's a ripoff of the book, but a ripoff of the book."
