76,66,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

66,8,I'm not a fan of anyone in the party either but I think the president of our nation is good for everyone involved.
66,17,My dad has a good friend who doesn't care about his children.
66,19,So he needs to go to a museum to look for a mask?
66,22,Vaccines mean less people die from the disease.
66,29,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

76,66,A med center in Canada is the first place I would look at a medical shield when I walked off a flight.
78,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,66,>It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,66,I know this is a bad thing. I ain't even here.
86,66,"The CDC was actually planning to start testing a mask on the next month or so. You could also take it outside for a week for example and see how it works, just like a helmet."
88,66,hey i'm in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance
97,66,What's your favorite kind of black dress?
98,66,"It is not a joke that you can't do this without a mask, because it's the only way to stop the spread of a virus, but a mask that protects you from the virus"
66,8,"Yes, Vaccines mean less people die from the disease."
66,17,"So you're asking what the president of our country has to say, ""Can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again please leep your mask on i don't want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone walking out of the grocery store in florida and i m taking my mask off as i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed"
66,19,This is actually good advice for the guy who vaccinates his children and also encourages him to have his kids vaccinate. Vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus.
66,22,Vaccines mean less people die from the disease.
66,29,Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

66,43,It's a good thing to not see a dr mp.
66,53,You've got an upvote.
66,54,I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
76,66,Is this the real reason for the fear in the US?
78,66,afk you should take a tour and see what happens if you want to try wearing a mask on a work trip.
81,66,"yep, but it is actually good advice. and he is wearing a mask and I think it is a really good thing they have taken this measure to prevent the spread of a virus."
84,66,"I know what the government thinks about the virus, but you have to give the doctor that kind of impression. The test results are a pretty positive sign."
86,66,"Is the thing you're talking about, is that you don't have to have a physical mask or anything to wear a mask. You could also take a mask and put it outside, and see how it works, just like a helmet. You also need to have a physical mask and a mask, because the only way to protect yourself, is to wear it outside while you're vaccinated."
88,66,I would be terrified of having a virus on my hand if I ran a half marathon there and there was no one there...
97,66,I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban.
98,66,"Unless the person I've met with at the party did a job for a while and decided to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, then I'd say that's the best way to stop it."
66,8,Vaccines can help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,17,"We need more laws that prevent this from happening. You can wear a mask if you like, and still make a big deal about it. If you don't like it, then you can wear a mask. I would be terrified if I was going to run a half marathon."
66,19,I would be terrified of having a virus on my hand if I ran a half marathon there and there was no one there... I love it when they don't take off my mask and then start to wear my turban.
66,22,"I don't even like the notion of taking a road trip because of the noise and I don't know about the idea of a road trip. But if my neighbor did, I would definitely do that, because it would be more uncomfortable for his kids if they didn't go there."

66,43,>You've got an upvote. I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
66,53,I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any kind of vaccine until I'm 40 - I'm just looking forward to getting one - and in my future I'm going to want to make sure I'm not ill. I feel very bad that the vaccines weren't already available.
66,54,I am an idiot that can't figure out the facts of what we see on the internet.
76,66,"... I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think wearing a mask will help stop the spread of a virus, and also help to reduce the risk of viruses spreading in people who aren't afected with it."
78,66,"I'd say there is a little misinformation. Specifically, ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus. Basically to prevent other people from getting a virus that causes serious illness by being afraid of being sick."
81,66,This is an awful joke. I can't help but think that some of these are very naive and do a really good job of making the government do something like this.
84,66,"It would make a lot more sense if you were not on an HIV-addict's list. I don't have a reason to be, but I'd do it."
86,66,The most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.
88,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I’m going to go fuck myself right now. I want to say this...
97,66,Well i've already mentioned i have a virus and I've been using a mask for several years
98,66,I think you just need a good mask.
66,8,The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to keep it away from your body. There are several methods of preventing it from spreading.
66,17,I grew up wearing a mask and the guy I met at the party was pretty cool. I had been on the street all the time so I did not want to go on a road trip with the kids. He did wear a mask but I grew up with no way to get off it. I was fucking crazy.
66,19,In that case I'd be really scared. You're a fucking prick.
66,22,"It's not just a joke, it's a good one. There are ways to stop an outbreak, and the whole concept of vaccines is wrong. You're right that it doesn't stop an outbreak, but if you are worried about it and want to get it vaccinated you need to have a good mask."
66,29,"Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Is the thing you're talking about, is that you don't have to have a physical mask or anything to wear a mask. You also need to have a physical mask and a mask, because the only way to protect yourself, is to wear it outside while you're vaccinated."
66,43,"A turban, a head mask, and a mask a mask."
66,53,I don't think anyone really cares about their health. It doesn't seem like a good idea to go to an infectious disease expert to explain what a CDC test was like but I think it is quite reasonable to go to the doctor to make sure your kids get theirs.
66,54,"I'm the one who made up this, but it's not the ""I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."""
76,66,"I'm a health professional. I didn't have a medical shield on when I was sick, and I'm no doctor. What I do know is that I can't put in my mask because it's infected and that's a really bad idea."
78,66,"It's not really a joke to me, and I think it's pretty ridiculous."
81,66,"I've heard some people like to think ""there is nothing the government can do"" when the OP is being made fun of."
84,66,I have been to a doctor a few times and it was very helpful to me. I didn't wear a mask at all when I was being treated. It's not a good idea to get a test but a good idea to be safe. It's the best way to prevent that.
86,66,I don't understand how you can get test to be in a public place.
88,66,"I'm not sure what you mean. I mean if I have a virus on my hand, I'm going to be very nervous. I do want to fuck myself right now."
97,66,I was about to take a note about wearing a mask after my friend started running into the store on the saturday. I think she was being very kind to me and took it out of her purse. I think it's not a very good idea. People have to see if they're going to be able to stop themselves because they don't.
98,66,"It's a joke, but it's not really the joke at all."
66,8,I feel like the only time I see any of this is in front of a friend. I think I might just be going around a bit with my kids.
66,17,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again please leep your mask on i don't want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone walking out of a grocery store.
66,19,">Hey, I'm gonna wear a turban and get a virus. I haven't seen the CDC tests in weeks, 'cause I think they've done so well, and I'm hoping that will keep them in a bit longer."
66,22,"It's not just a joke, it's a good one."
66,29,I'm going to make a good point that it is not a joke. I mean if you need to get tested on a test that's actually a good idea.
66,43,"You sound pretty unprofessional, right? What can I do to fuck myself right now?"
66,53,"Vaccines have been the best idea of the last 5 years - and the only way to prevent it is to get one. If it fucks you up, you can’t have a valid vaccine and it has to stop vaccinating them."
66,54,It's funny how this guy is getting into an abusive relationship with an infectious disease expert.
76,66,It sounds like a very small chance that someone with HIV or even a HIV patient would end up with the virus.
78,66,I'm not sure how this could be done. I'm not sure how a mask would work and I don't think this would be a joke.
81,66,I like to think 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus'.
84,66,">""I gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday', ""I know this is a bad thing. I ain't even here."", ""I know what the government thinks about the virus, but you have to give the doctor that kind of impression. The test results are a pretty positive sign."", ""I know what the government thinks about the virus,"
86,66,"People who have been vaccinated to avoid any symptoms can be seen with a mask, but the government has been trying to find ways to help."
88,66,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I’m sorry Mark, but I’ve seen a virus on my hand. The fact that I get infected with a virus that doesn’t seem to be that bad actually makes me really nervous."
97,66,"> I love wearing a mask to prevent a virus, but it's useless and I hate it."
98,66,I've had a LOT of people try to explain to me the reason for why a mask is so funny. They have no idea what the joke is. My dad wears a mask to protect himself because it's funny.
66,8,"I do know that he's being extremely rude to me, but it was very important to him that you walked in."
66,17,I don't think anyone will do this. You haven't done anything wrong in this whole country.
66,19,"If you do anything, then it's good for you to be vaccinated before you have a chance of catching HIV."
66,22,"""Maskedness can help with a lot of things, but it does not do anything to prevent someone's symptoms. It will help prevent a lot of illnesses. I feel like you've gone through a lot of trauma. I'm not saying you're racist or anything, but I just think a mask should be the first thing people do in public."
66,29,I'm pretty sure a good thing to be saying would be 'I can't stop myself from getting a virulent disease in a week?'
66,43,You've got an upvote. I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
66,53,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,54,It's funny how the government is getting into an abusive relationship with an infectious disease expert.
76,66,"This is not a joke, but if the CDC really does care about preventing the spread of the disease then this is a pretty great place to start. I'd be really interested to read the other articles."
78,66,"You know, it's not funny - it's very serious and dangerous. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life."
81,66,"A lot of kids still think it's a great joke but unless you see the video, you just get pissed that a naive child is wearing a mask and it's like ""you can't prevent a kid from getting a cold."""
84,66,I have an HIV infection. I've been on some drug and AIDS prevention programs. I've never had a serious illness.
86,66,"No, but I don't see why the CDC would have to test people outside of public places to see how they work."
88,66,It's a joke. I've noticed the last time I heard this from my mother was a couple years ago and it's really odd to me how many people realize that this is about the government's actions in preventing HIV in the country.
97,66,"I'm a very troll who uses turbans for all sorts of purposes and turbans are the bare minimum of protection. I am a really good person and wear hats. I love wearing a mask to stop my neighbors from getting infected and that can prevent them from sneezing. I've seen a lot of things like this happening to me too, and I'm not surprised turbans are common in other countries."
98,66,"i wear my mask every day to protect myself because i'm not gonna go out with my lip in. my boyfriend doesn't like wearing them and i hate it. but i've been so irritated by my husband. and i feel terrible for him, that i can't even deal with the fact that i'm able to do something to stop a virus"
66,8,You're so stupid. Your husband is a racist nutbag. He is a racist.
66,17,[[Tahri]'s wife has told a man on a street in the state she works for that is an employee of the CDC to protect the citizens from HIV/AIDs because of the fact that she was vaccinated in order to prevent a virulent disease from spread. She refused to vaccinate her husband and says he hoped it wouldn't hurt her feelings.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Shame/wiki/Masked-Shame_Film-Masked-S
66,19,"I'm sorry to hear this, but I was able to leave you with that."
66,22,What about the AIDS virus? What can you do about it if you’re not able to get the vaccine?
66,29,It's the CDC's job to fight infections of the public and their vaccines are for life. They should know what to do with the government's actions based on the facts.
66,43,My dad has no problem with wearing a mask and I know what he's doing. He has no problem with going out with a mask because I think he's a troll. I know it's not that funny but it doesn't come close to what he wants us to think about.
66,53,I was trying to tell you this but I had been a bit harsh when I tried to convince myself to take care of myself.
66,54,"In all seriousness, the fact that it's a joke is an insult."
76,66,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,66,"I feel like we have a chance to be a bit jerk in this regard. It's time to start trying to understand your mind. If you ever need to be an expert on what's going on in a country like the United States, try going to the doctor or to the doctor to get a diagnosis or screening."
81,66,"Yes, the problem with it is that it's the best joke out there. Its funny because it's fun but not just because it's a joke."
84,66,"If you aren't the best person, then yes, the government is trying to make it illegal to make a vaccination mandate. The CDC is trying to make it illegal because of what's currently going on with the vaccinations. The mask mandate isn't an appropriate response for people who don't know what it's about."
86,66,Vaccines are a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy.
88,66,I was going to say this. But I can't understand why people feel so bad about it.
97,66,"I don't think people should wear a mask to stop a virus, but I would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. YMMV. It seems like your husband is trying to make you laugh, but I don't think he does. Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent a virus, but it's useless and I hate it."
98,66,"I had a few friends tell me to wear a mask whenever they are out, but none of them asked or mentioned anything about it."
66,8,"My boyfriend was not even able to get a vaccination in order to prevent AIDS/Ibs. His mom made him wear a mask for his friends and it got all of his friends sick. He didn't want to deal with it and was unable to get a vaccine. He walked into a meeting of the president for the same reason. He'd been wearing a mask for the past few months, and he refused to do it. He said no. And he didn't want to take anything on, so he made it seem as though he had any"

66,19,"The fact that it's being trolled is not a racist or a joke, it is just the government's incompetence in dealing with it."
66,22,"Then, it's not a joke. This is not a joke."
66,29,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,43,"AIDS is not about ""fun"" it's about making people believe the government's actions."
66,53,"A virus could go on and on and on and on and on. Vaccines have been the best idea of the last 5 years - and the only way to prevent it is to get one. If it fucks you up, you can’t have a valid vaccine and it has to stop vaccinate them."

76,66,>The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus.
78,66,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. The government is bringing the problem out of the closet in order to help people stop them from coming in with the disease. Is it the government? Is it the government? Is it the government?
81,66,"I'm not sure what your point is, but some of the facts are valid."
84,66,"...i hate to say it, but I have never been sick or have had a serious illness so thats what I'm trying to say. The government is trying to make it illegal."
86,66,"I don't think that a mask is necessarily a gimmick, but if it is that, you can use the ones they have and see for yourself. The CDC is looking for something that could be used to prevent the spread of a virus and a mask that can be used to help prevent it. That said, it's a bad idea, and it's pretty obvious a medical gimmick can't be useful for any person, because it's a good idea. But if you think about it, a medical gi"

97,66,"I am going to come up with a good idea. I am going to start my own website, but I'm going to say I'd never do anything to prevent the spread of HIV."
98,66,Using a mask is not just a joke.

66,19,"I grew up on a farm in the south so when I was in high school it was a joke. I would go to a museum and look for a mask because it was a joke. I was going to go to the doctor but the guy couldn't do it and wanted a mask, so I was putting on a mask to prevent the spread.

66,29,"Vaccines are more effective than a real vaccine, and they are better than being worn outside for a week with a mask to protect your brain from viral infections. This is a valid point to make, but not entirely the case."
66,43,>I'm going to come up with a good idea. I am going to say I'd never do anything to prevent the spread of HIV. Using a mask is not just a joke.
66,53,"I'm going to say that my husband didn't want to get a vaccination, but is willing to compromise because of that."
66,54,It is the government trying to make it illegal. And that's the joke.
76,66,"I'm afraid I'm not sure what they want you to think. I don't know much about the science behind this, but what they really want is to put a mask on so the virus doesn't spread."
78,66,"I read an article about a person in the US who was forced to wear a mask because it was actually a joke, but that's not the case here."
81,66,I was on a roll and my kids were sick so I was very pissed that they weren't being given vaccines. That's where I'm getting sick from.
84,66,"You can still be a good person if you have a helmet. I have a mask that I wear, and it works perfectly fine for the job unless the sick are in a serious condition."
86,66,"I don't think any government would be able to give us a reliable, scientific reason to give people vaccines that actually work. I don't think anyone would do it if not for the CDC."
88,66,This is the CDC's job.
97,66,"I was at the hospital with a turban and a turban on. It was painful. I went up to the hospital to get it and they said it's the only thing that stopped the virus from spreading to my area, and it's the only thing I've seen in person to be so painful."
98,66,I have a friend of mine that wears a mask because he doesn't think he is being an asshole. I hate her for it.

I was so scared that I wasn't able to be in a place with any fucking disease but fortunately, no one wanted to go outside and make the most of the hospital. My husband is"
66,22,The joke isn't that they would not want people to feel bad or uncomfortable if their spouse did it. The joke is that they would feel bad for someone who was already sick.

66,43,"If you can't wear a mask at work then you should definitely check in with the CDC. They're looking for a way to get the vaccines, not a turban."
66,53,It’s the government’s job to give people a safe place to live. We do it.
66,54,It's an insult. The fact that it's a joke is an insult.
76,66,[RAINFUL](http://www.sunflowerhealth.org/publication/Final_Facil/Denver_Vise/Visit_Waiting_Making](http://www.unwashed-health.org/publications/Visit-Visiting/Visit-Visit-Visit-Visit-Visit) is a really good TED Talk I've had in my entire life.
78,66,Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
81,66,"So, the government has a role in the spread of viruses? Are you sure?"
84,66,"I'm not sure what a mask mandate is about. I’m not sure why people feel this way. I also don’t know what a mask mandate means but I do know that there are a lot of problems with the idea of a mask mandate, such as the 'ask for a test to prevent the spread of a virus."
86,66,"I've heard that the government can’t prevent the spread of vaccines, as far as I can tell. And they could do nothing to prevent TB from spreading, unless the virus does get transmitted by the government. That’s what the AMA is about."
88,66,"''You're sorry Mark, but I've seen a virus on my hand. The fact that I get infected with a virus that doesn't seem to be that bad actually makes me really nervous. I do want to fuck myself right now. I want to say this...'', ""But I can't understand why people feel so bad about it.""'' Because there's a joke and it's a joke. They are trying to tarnish the idea of masks ''You're really a joke.''"
97,66,I've been trying to remember my time.
98,66,I am very ashamed to be in this thread. The CDC is not responsible for the spreading of the virus.
66,8,"""It is ridiculous. I'm going to come up with a good idea."""
66,17,"The problem is that the CDC can only be considered the 'right' option for all people, including the uninfected."
66,19,I would be very nervous. That's what I was about to say.
66,22,I don't know if I've ever seen a video of a guy in a mask with a turban or not. What's a turban?
66,29,This is very different from what it was in the 'Statement' of the CDC. 'Statement's a joke.
66,43,AIDS is not about fun it's about making people believe the government's actions.
66,53,You think you are being harsh and you're actually a joke?
66,54,It's a joke.
76,66,CDC is part of the Government's job. This is NOT what it's about.
78,66,I think I read the article.
81,66,Its a joke because it isn't a joke.
84,66,"Yes, the CDC is trying to make it illegal. They are trying to make it illegal because of what's currently going on with the vaccinations. They are trying to make it illegal because they are trying to make it illegal. The government is trying to make it illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
86,66,I think the AMA is a great way to describe it.
88,66,What if there was a virus on your hand and you were taken out?
97,66,Is this a joke? Because I have a bunch of pricks in the background who are like the pricks that I know.
98,66,"I am going to tell you that I wear a mask when I'm in public, but no one I know has ever commented. If you need to talk to me about a joke, I am going to ask them to take me out."
66,8,People are being racist by doing so.
66,17,"Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again please leep your mask on i don't want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone walking out of the grocery store."""
66,19,It's also not a joke. I'm trying to think of a joke. It's not just about being a prick. It's about being responsible for your own health.
66,22,This is what I've been going through lately.
66,29,I do not know where this is from but I have heard that TB spreads much faster with the same degree of ease.
66,43,"I'm gonna fuck people who don't want to get infected with HIV, because that's a terrible joke."
66,53,It's also a joke that people aren't comfortable in public and the CDC is trying to make it illegal to do that to those people.
66,54,What the fuck is that?
76,66,Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated.
78,66,"This subreddit is an uninformed, stupid and terribly under-reported version of the book."
81,66,"""'I think a new and improved one. I think people do need to find a new and improved one.''"
84,66,"In this instance, the CDC is telling you to wear a mask because the CDC wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
86,66,I'm not a doctor. The AMA is about spreading disease.
88,66,I think it is a joke.
97,66,... and we have a'sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
98,66,"It's not just a joke, but a joke. It is a joke."
66,8,"I don't think there's any other way for us to see the CDC's reaction to this, but a good example of it is when people talk about the issue at a community gathering - that is how we would use that information to prevent them from spreading virus."
66,17,The government needs to get out. The CDC will need the government.
66,19,I'm not going to talk about the joke.
66,22,Is your husband a racist?
66,29,"I feel like I'm being racist by blaming some of the jokes. I want to make a point, but it's not a joke."
66,43,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
66,53,Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated.
66,54,It's a joke. It's a joke that is trying to be racist.
76,66,"If the CDC was supposed to stop the spread of HIV, I think the CDC should make sure it's not about a viral disease."
78,66,The headline is in line with the title. Its about preventing the spread of a virus.
81,66,"It's not funny, it's not a joke, and it's not really what it is. That's it. It's a joke. Its a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. But it's not a joke. I think people need to find a new and improved one."
84,66,"I don't think you need to be late a few times to get a test. But if you're going to wear a mask, you're going to need to get it off your head. The fact that you have to wear a mask is a huge red flag. And if you can't afford a mask, you might as well have to go with a a wig."
86,66,"I’ve been vaccinated. I’ve had to go through a lot of doctor visits in order to get to the hospital. I don’t know if I can afford to continue with it, but I also don’t have the means for all of that."
88,66,"I just read that the government is trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. The joke isn't that it is a joke, but that it is a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS by not preventing it."
97,66,"People who wear turbans can get an HIV shot in their head. The trick is to stop it. They can get it spread but you just have to use it. Basically, it is just a way of doing what you need to do to stop the spread of HIV."
98,66,Wearing a mask does not stop the spread of a virus.
66,8,This is the worst joke I've ever heard.
66,17,"You don't know how a joke works. You see it is a joke, right?"
66,19,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
66,22,So it's not the mask he's wearing that stops an outbreak of HIV.
66,29,"The CDC is trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. The headline isn't that it is a joke, but that it is a joke."
66,43,I don't get what'sa joke' is. It's a joke because there's not one reason to go out with a mask. Using a mask is a joke to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke to stop people from spreading it.
66,53,That's what the comments say. It's not a joke because the comment is blaming some of the jokes.
66,54,The joke was about the CDC's attitude to HIV.
76,66,"As a fellow health professional, I am concerned about the stigma attached to vaccinating. Is it a real, genuine, universal concern that the CDC is not able to prevent the spread of HIV?"
78,66,I think you are missing the point of this subreddit. The CIA is a group.
81,66,I believe there are many reasons people wouldn't like the government's 'Joke' that's used to describe the fact that there's a government role in the spread of viruses in this country.
84,66,">I gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday', ""I know this is a bad thing. I ain't even here."", ""I know what the government thinks about the virus, but you have to give the doctor that kind of impression. The test results are a pretty positive sign."
86,66,The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB.
88,66,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. This is a very small joke. There's also a lot of sexist, hateful jokes and a bunch of other ridiculous ideas on the internet. It is a really good one. I'm a doctor. I'd love to get one, but you guys are pretty pathetic."
97,66,"i think people wear a mask because they think a virus has spread, because it makes them feel better about themselves"
98,66,"The most blatant sexist joke of all time is that the only real joke in existence is wearing a mask to protect you. Besides, it's not really a joke and it doesn't make any sense to be able to tell the truth. I think the whole joke is just stupid and ridiculous."
66,8,"I thought that joke was an attempt to discourage a troll, like you and your partner, to wear a turban and not to go out with a friend or the president. So he asked if there were any other ways to prevent it. That's how he approached it."
66,17,"The joke is that they use a mask because they're afraid of HIV in public and it's a joke that's ridiculous. It's not a joke because they're scared of HIV. It's a joke because people say it's a joke. Mostly because it's a joke. And if someone's going to say it, and it's wrong, then they might just be trying to justify it a bit."
66,19,This is a very good joke. I’m a doctor.
66,22,I don't understand why the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV.
66,29,Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,43,"There is a very clear difference between a joke and a joke, except that in this situation it is a joke."
66,53,"Vaccines are not a joke, they just have a more positive side effect, i.e. it's safer and doesn't affect your health, while the CDC is trying to stop it."
66,54,">I'm the one who made up this, but it's not the ""I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."", ""I don't know if I can afford to continue with it, but I also don't have the means for all of that. I just read that the government is trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. The joke isn't that it is a joke, but that it is a joke."
76,66,There is a very good reason to believe that if you do get it you will have the benefit of being vaccinated.
78,66,I can't help but laugh at the CIA and all the other shit they've gotten themselves into.
81,66,"Yes, you are correct. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
84,66,The mask mandate would also make a good choice for health care in general.
86,66,Vaccines are meant to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are supposed to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccines are mostly to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are meant to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
88,66,Vaccines are illegal because they prevent the spread of HIV.
97,66,"The joke that people wear a mask to stop a virus is a way to get the word out quickly, but I'm not sure what it's a joke."
98,66,"If I were you, I would have a funny face. I would have a happy face."
66,8,"Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of the disease. It's meant to prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccines are meant to stop the spread of the virus. The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB. Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
66,17,"You're not the one who made up this, but you are the one who made up this."
66,19,"Vaccination prevents the spread of HIV, so it's a joke to be vaccinated to protect your own health."
66,22,It is kind of ridiculous. Is your husband a racist?
66,29,It’s not a joke because they want you to be able to walk outside. It’s a joke because there is a lot of people out there who do that and do not believe in it.
66,43,This is an article about a joke that's not a joke.
66,53,"[This is a very good joke. I’m the one who made up this, but it’s not the ""I hate to say this but I’m sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."", ""I just read that the government is trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. The joke that people wear a mask to stop a virus is a way to get the word out quickly, but I’m not sure what it’s a joke."
66,54,So what did I just read here?
76,66,I don't think there's anything bad in the comments that could be said about this. I think the CDC should be able to make it a much better public health program.
78,66,I don't know where you are.
81,66,"I don't even like the word ""joke,"" I like how there are several reasons people don't like a joke about the government."
84,66,The Obama Mask Mandate [The CDC is trying to make it illegal because they are trying to make it illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented].

66,17,"""It's a joke because they're afraid of HIV in public and it's a joke because people say it's a joke. Mostly because it's a joke. Mostly because they might just be trying to justify it."""
66,19,It's ridiculous. But he is still trying to make himself fit. That's really sad.
66,22,"> ""Maskedness can help with a lot of things, but it does not do anything to prevent someone's symptoms. It will help prevent a lot of illnesses. I feel like you’ve gone through a lot of trauma. I’m not saying you’re racist or anything, but I just think a mask should be the first thing people do in public."","
66,29,"The whole point of the Obama mask mandate is that it's a joke that's not being laughed at. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but it is a joke that I don't like."
66,43,This ad isn't a joke. It's a joke about the government putting people in danger and it's really just an excuse to do that.
66,53,Isn't the government trying to make this a joke? Why the joke about having kids wear a mask?
66,54,The whole joke is a racist joke.
76,66,I think that this is one of the reasons that CDC is so bad. I think it's a shame that people are being so incredibly negative about a virus.
78,66,"This is what's going on in the AMA. The title should be more like, ""I feel like we have a chance to be a bit jerk in this regard. It's time to start trying to understand your mind."""
81,66,I'd be more interested in the CDC tinnitus joke.
84,66,"a viremia is actually pretty bad. 'Making a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I haven't been late to a test, but I got a bust on the way.

86,66,"The AMA is about the government, the CDC and the AMA."
88,66,"You're gonna have to change your perspective and see your side of the story. The doctor isn't a joke, it's a joke."
97,66,"In that context, the joke about wearing a mask is being a joke. But as a person with a turban in their 50s, this joke is a joke. I would say a mask is the best way to prevent a turban and I would say it's funny. But I am not sure what the definition of a joke is. What is the worst way to avoid HIV? It seems like your husband is trying to make you laugh, but I don't think he does. I think it's funny."
98,66,This is just a fun time to put your face out!
66,8,"My husband makes fun of this a lot. He gets angry that people think it is the same way a guy wants to do a joke about a disease. He doesn't want to have it, but it is a joke. Mostly because people just don't like it, because they think it's silly."

66,19,"As a CDC neurologist and doctor I’ve always thought the government is a good place to help prevent the spread of HIV, they have to be pretty vigilant, and have a lot of research done before we even make assumptions. The joke is really funny and not racist, it really is just part of the campaign against the government."
66,22,"It's not a joke. It's not a joke. Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."
66,29,He is trying to tell people that he wants to make a joke and not just a joke about them.
66,43,I'm sorry but I don't think it is appropriate to say anything racist.
66,53,"Its a joke. A joke. But it doesn't matter who it is, it will help prevent some kind of viral infection and it doesn't make people sick."
66,54,What's this? The people who use the Obama mask are ignorant and ignorant.
76,66,">But I don't think we are cliched, but this is something that should be discussed with me about it."
78,66,"I have a very big idea about how to stop a viral infection, but I'm not sure that there's any reason to stop it. In fact, this can be done. You can prevent a virus from growing on the surface of the air. There's no way to stop the spread of a virus without a mask."
81,66,"The CDC has given children a few medical treatments that work better, such as a vaccine and antibiotics for the flu, which is a really good thing."
84,66,"I don't know about the CDC and the mask mandate, but it does seem like an extreme case where a mask mandate is needed to prevent people from being on HIV/AIDS prevention programs. It does seem like the Obama mask mandate is the best thing EVER."
86,66,"This is a funny AMA. The AMA is a joke, the AMA is a joke. The AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the AMA."
88,66,This is actually a really big red flag. It’s not about the CDC’s job. It’s about the government trying to prevent HIV/AIDS.

66,22,">Is your husband a racist?',"
66,29,"I know what you mean. I mean, the person that made the jokes says something along the lines of, ""Oh man, no! Vaccines are not a joke, they're a joke. The CDC and the AMA aren't racist in a bad way. They're just ignoring the fact that you're being racist because the AMA was about a government, the CDC, and the AMA. You're gonna have to change your perspective and see your side of the story."
66,43,It’s the same kind of joke that people make when shit doesn’t work - they’re the ones who want to kill them.
66,53,"A person with a turban in their 50s is going to be sick and get vaccinated, but they're being raped, because they can't stand that the vaccine will help them spread it."
66,54,The guy who is trying to make people laugh and make them laugh is also a racist.

They might get pissed, but it’s in my memory. I think the CIA is trying to protect people from the CIA."
81,66,It's a joke because it's a joke.
84,66,I don't have a clue what a mask mandate is. I just need to know. I can't help but think of a whole bunch of different things that would make a viremia a joke.
86,66,"AMAs are a joke, and there are lots of ways to describe it. It's also a great way to describe the government."
88,66,We should stop the joke by giving everyone the choice to not be afraid of the virus. You're an idiot for not having the choice. You have a choice. But you aren't going to have a choice.
97,66,The jokes that make a joke in itself are not relevant and in no way contribute to the discussion. What are the best jokes that do what we believe is best?
98,66,I'm not sure about you but it sounds like a joke.
66,8,"This was made in a very serious way - to make a joke, but to make an argument against the whole ""honey hats are dangerous to the health of the child"" joke."

76,66,"I'm trying to explain to you why we have to wear the CDC’s health system to prevent AIDS? You don’t need it. If you need a virus for life, you have to be vaccinated."
78,66,"I had this issue with a doctor at work who did a lot of AMAs with medical professionals about people wearing masks when sick, with her pointing out the difference between a man with AIDS who went to the doctor and a man with AIDS who went to the doctor. My colleagues agreed to that they should go to a doctor to get a diagnosis or screening, which is the whole point. I'm glad my colleagues are not trying to get that."

97,66,"I've gotten sick of the notion of masks. So I'm not going to come up with a joke about wearing one. Until I have a few days where I'm happy to wear a turban, or whatever it is that makes me nervous and want to go."
98,66,"No kidding. That's actually what he's saying. Honestly, it's not just a joke, it's a joke too."
66,8,Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,17,"Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."
66,19,"There are so many ways to communicate with a person, but in this case it's simply not appropriate for them to have the same conversation. And they are correct that the joke is not racist."

66,43,I don't see a joke about anyone being infected.
66,53,"The point isn't to make it a joke, the point is that the point of the joke is to make it a joke that's meant to be a joke, so it doesn't have any negative negative spin, nor do the comments make the point that the joke is not funny."
66,54,"""You should be ashamed of your religion, because of your health and your political views and your social views."""
76,66,"i think it is an interesting idea, but i was a little skeptical at first, as i just didn't think it would make it easier for people to get vaccines instead of the stigma associated with them"
78,66,And what's worse is that the AMA has become a very popular thread with anti-vaccine supporters
81,66,"I'm going to look for a funny one to make fun of the government. I'm more interested in the film ""The Red Cross,"" it's an awesome movie. It's all about a government role in the spread of viruses."
84,66,You gotta look up the definition of a mask. It was actually actually invented by a politician. It's just not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC wants to make it illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety.
86,66,"I don't think it's a joke, but a joke."
88,66,"Yes, you are a joke, but I can’t see what you are saying because there are some things that aren’t a joke. A joke about the government trying to stop the spread of HIV, a joke about the way a CDC is using a mask to stop people from getting infected. That’s exactly what I’m saying - 'This is a joke, it is a joke. People aren’t always that prone to get infected because they don’t know how to use a mask. It’s also a"
97,66,"A person wearing a mask is a joke, but the meaning of the joke hasn't changed because they are wearing them."
98,66,> The CDC is not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV. So we should stop it.
66,8,The CDC is responsible for stopping the spread of HIV. It doesn't even say you are a racist by doing that.
66,17,I think it's a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is not meant to be a joke.
66,19,Vaccines are not for life.
66,22,"It is a joke, it is a joke. Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."
66,29,"""Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again please leep your mask on. I’m pretty sure a good thing to be saying would be 'I can’t stop myself from getting a virulent disease in a week?’"
66,43,"It's not racist, but a joke. There are people who say something along those lines. I know a lot of 'you're very sensitive, and I don't want to be infected by anything, but you're infected with something."
66,53,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
66,54,"This joke is really an insult and a joke if it's not, why aren't there enough people who are on the diet to tell you it's funny?"
76,66,This is the most interesting of the five...
78,66,"Is the article about a 'we aren't allowed to wear masks,' or is the AMA about a 'we are causing the AIDS epidemic' or something like that?"
81,66,It's all about a government role in the spread of viruses. ''But it's not a joke.
84,66,"People are being manipulated, and it's too dangerous and unwise for their government to make such a move."
86,66,>The whole AMA is about the government and the world's population.
88,66,"I think you should tell him to ""leep your mask on if you don't want to be taken out by a virus that is not gone"", since he's making an attempt to make the joke funny and funny."
97,66,The CDC is trying to make a joke about this.
98,66,"Well, I was also infected with a virus in my childhood, so I don't think a few people actually wear any of these things. My grandmother and aunt have a similar thing called a ""Burning up, I'm wearing a mask for protection"", but that's really all she did."
66,8,"I like that part, but it's still one of the most jarring things to say to an individual. You don't want to tell him that he's doing it to make jokes."
66,17,"Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke. People are being manipulated, and it's too dangerous and unwise for their government to make such a move."

66,22,"Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."
66,29,We're talking about a 'joke' that has been in place by the government for years because we're trying to get rid of a virus that has spread across the entire country. There's no point in talking about the facts of the situation in the way that people think it's funny. It's like saying a joke is more effective than a joke about a problem we have.
66,43,">the whole AMA is about the government and the world's population. I think you should tell him to ""leep your mask on if you don't want to be infected with something"", since he's making an attempt to make the joke funny and funny."
66,53,"I can't believe the amount of people who said things like that were so confused when they realized this was not real, while claiming to be the joke."
66,54,"People need to get out of this place and get more people to wear a mask. It seems to me to be just a way of describing the dangers of HIV. I don't know what to do, I've had this happen and this was my first time doing something."
76,66,It sounds like a good idea - you should see a doctor first.
78,66,"I don't know why you're so critical about the AMAs. They're so sad and they're like that. It's like a joke and not a joke but I do have a big problem with how the article is being misrepresented. The AMA is a rip off. But the actual article is the actual AMA, which is where the AMA comes from. There is a very strong argument that it's actually a joke but if you want to rip off the article, the article is about people to put on a hat on"
81,66,Is this a shit joke? I don't think so. It's a joke about a government role in the spread of viruses.
84,66,"""...the CDC is trying to make it illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."""
86,66,The AMA is about the government and the world's population.
88,66,"In other words, it's a joke."
97,66,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC wants to make a joke about the people who make jokes about it. That's one way to get the message out.
98,66,I don't even like it. It's not really a joke.
66,8,Vaccines are not for life. The point of a mask or helmet is to prevent the spread of the virus. The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB. Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of a virus. The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB. Vaccines are not for life.
66,17,Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because people say it's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV.
66,19,I just can't see how the CDC is trying to bring down the real issue and make it sound like it's just a joke.
66,22,Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV.
66,29,It's been in place by the government for years because the government is trying to get rid of the AIDS epidemic.
66,43,That's where all these people make up jokes.
66,53,"I'm not being facetious. I mean, people don't have to be vaccinated and the people that do wear hats are a joke."
66,54,CANNOTANSWER: the CDC wants to make a joke about the people who make jokes about it.
76,66,"a couple of people on r/raisedaboutviralia say this is the worst joke ever and are describing it as a bad idea. it would be silly to have a TED talk about this, especially one that said that it was a joke and not a joke about the government, it would be sad to have a post about the government, who haven't actually done anything about preventing the spread of viruses in public places."
78,66,"Having the AMA started as a joke, I figured the CDC would take it seriously."
81,66,"I'm sorry, I was too busy talking about the movie"
84,66,And I ain't even going to say something about the CDC.
86,66,Are you a doctor? I’m sure that’s the most serious point of the article.
88,66,It’s a joke because the joke is the same as the joke about a doctor who is supposed to stop people from getting infected with HIV (or a virus). It’s a joke because it’s a joke because of the joke about the government helping to stop HIV. It’s a joke because the joke is being used as a joke about the government trying to prevent the spread of HIV.
97,66,"I don't want to be the one who is downvoting this, but it's hard to read because the CDC has no real intention of blaming the people in this article with what they're getting, including the fact that this is a joke."
98,66,"My mother says she wears a mask to protect herself from the virus. I wear a mask because I am uncomfortable with being in public, but I can't stand it at all. She said she loves it, but she said I didn't care for it. She's probably not really sure what the joke is, but she may well have found it offensive, and not really funny."
66,8,It's funny that they're arguing against the fact that the CDC hasn't done anything. But a lot of people like this aren't actually racist. I would be more irked if I were you.
66,17,"In my experience, people who wear masks aren't going to realize it's a joke or not really even a joke. People who say it is a joke are probably just as out of place as the jokes they get."
66,19,Because the CDC is essentially trying to engulf the health and safety of the American public. And not just preventing it from spread. They're trying to make the people around them look like pigeons.
66,22,"I'm not saying I don't like it, but I'm just saying it's a good idea and is not a joke."
66,29,I think the CDC should start putting a 'pill'at this point. There's no point in saying 'this joke' and I don't like it. It's not a joke.
66,43,I would like to ask why I was so concerned about it. It would make you uncomfortable. It would also make you uncomfortable with the thought of not being able to see the CDC putting your health at risk.
66,53,"> ""The point of a mask or helmet is to elicit and protect a greater effect than the risk of TB. Vaccines are for life."
66,54,">I am an idiot that can't figure out the facts of what we see on the internet., 'I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."", ""I am the one who made up this, but it's not the ""I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."","""
76,66,I read that the CDC was the only agency to have a mandate of vaccination for certain people who had AIDS. That's like saying we are allowed to vaccinate everyone and that we shouldn't put on masks when we're sick.
78,66,It's about the CDC.
81,66,Honestly I found the humor funny and the video interesting as well. The only thing is that we figured that the government isn't doing anything like this. I don't know if that's the same as the problem but I just think it's pretty funny.
84,66,It's a joke about the CDC not having health histories whose goal it is to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a joke about the CDC putting you in an uncomfortable position because you don't have the health histories - but you don't know if the CDC is interested in making the mandate illegal because of what's going on with the vaccines.
86,66,Why would you want to do this? What do you think of the AMA?
88,66,You're being a joke.
97,66,I think this shit should be taken seriously and you do need to go to the CDC's attention. 
98,66,"I believe the government is responsible for the spread of HIV, they are only responsible for the spread of it when it is not being abused by the public."
66,8,"It's not funny. It's not about avoiding it and it's not about the CDC causing the disease. The CDC's actions are being interpreted by other organizations, so it isn't funny. It's about the vaccines and it's not even about the CDC's actions, it's about the CDC."
66,17,A lot of the jokes you're referring to are just nonsense. And so are a bunch of other jokes.
66,19,"The CDC is a joke, not a joke. I think it was an attempt to cover up the joke by making it appear that the government hasn't done anything. It was a joke and it's not about the CDC being incompetent. They're not doing anything."
66,22,The fact that the government is 'putting in place' and being very anti-government against those who don't support the CDC is what makes this shit so funny.
66,29,It's like saying a joke is more effective than a joke about a problem we have. It's a joke because the government is trying to engulf the health and safety of the American public. And not just preventing the spread of AIDS.
66,43,"> I wear a mask because I am uncomfortable with being in public, but I can't stand it at all."
66,53,"The CDC...... is not really a joke, it's just not in the 'fuck it' zone. The fact that they're trying to make this joke out of something is a little confusing."
66,54,What do you think of the CDC is doing?
76,66,It is a joke based on a book. It seems that the joke is about the government and not the CDC.
78,66,">I read the article.', ""I can't help but laugh at the CIA and all the other shit they've gotten themselves into."", ""I think I read the article.'"
81,66,"""I don't think that's the same as the problem but I just think it's pretty funny."""
84,66,The CDC wants to make a mask mandate illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented. The CDC wants to make it illegal because they want people to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented.
86,66,"""Hey AMA, we need a new AMA. I'm not a doctor and I can't imagine anyone in the US doing that."""
88,66,"A lot of people think this joke is a joke, but in reality is just a joke. There's a r/raisedbyjudgement of the joke on here."
97,66,"A ""I don't think you're funny and your mom is hilarious."
98,66,I agree with all of those comments.
66,8,> Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of the disease. It's meant to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccines are meant to prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccines are not for life.
66,17,You're making up a joke and it's just a joke.
66,19,The whole issue of the joke isn't about the government. The point of the joke is that people are not looking for a reason to feel uncomfortable or at the same place they have a problem. It's about the government being responsible for the spread of HIV.
66,22,The CDC is a joke based on a book. It seems that the joke is about the government and not the CDC.
66,29,">I believe the government is responsible for the spread of HIV, they are only responsible for the spread of it when it is not being abused by the public."
66,43,Nope! Just go get the CDC and get it.
66,53,You're being facetious and being harsh - a lot of this joke is what's bothering me.
66,54,">Is this a joke about the government, not the CDC? ''But a lot of people think this joke is a joke, but in reality is just a joke."
76,66,"Then the CDC can say this: 'If you don't need it, you shouldn't put on a mask when you're sick.'"
78,66,I don't know about yours.
81,66,"It makes no sense that a government role in the spread of a virus is a joke, but that's the point."
84,66,"I don't really know what a mask mandate means, but I think the whole point of a mask mandate is to prevent people from being sick and are able to get a shot to prevent some illnesses from advancing and becoming worse in general."
86,66,"Yes, it is a joke. They are just saying it to a troll for wanting to avoid the spread of an illness. I hate to come across like that in the headline but I’m sure it’s just one of those things."
88,66,"There are a few facts here that are worth pointing out. First, the CDC is trying to stop HIV spread. Second, the joke is not that much joke, it's just that there's a huge stigma around it. Third, if you want to be safe, wear a mask. It doesn't get you infected, that's a joke. It's not a joke, and it's a joke, and the joke is just a joke. It's not about the government's job to prevent it from spreading, and then you"
97,66,No one is going to get into any kind of hiccups. No one is going to get into any.
98,66,"This is so hilarious. And not a good one, but an excellent one, I'm so happy for you!"
66,8,"A lot of people don't even understand the joke. But I think that it was made to make it seem like it was the most important thing that he did, and that it was a joke."
66,17,You can't have the CDC - but you can have a federal government - decide what the government does? That's the 'right' option for the people who have no idea what the government is doing.
66,19,"This isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
66,22,The whole idea of a mask being a joke is not exactly true. It's not like someone is vaccinating their child with it but only after the first time in awhile.
66,29,">Is this a joke about the government, not the CDC?"
66,43,A lot of people in this thread believe the CDC is putting people in danger.

66,54,I was trying to get a few comments that were really good for me.
76,66,I'd like to add that you are a medical professional and don't want to hear a lot of comments promoting the government as a joke about it.
78,66,"As I said before, people wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. This isn't a joke. It's just a joke."
81,66,"It's pretty funny, and it makes no sense, but it's a joke."
84,66,"""...but you have to give the doctor that kind of impression. The test results are a pretty positive sign. The mask mandate would also make a good choice for health care in general. I'm not sure what a mask mandate is about."
86,66,AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke.
88,66,"If you go to the hospital and see someone, they will probably stop putting a mask on you if it means you are infected with the virus. So they will start putting a mask on you and ask you to fuck off if you are actually sick. Then they'll say no to you."
97,66,Why should we take that back to the CDC? Because we do not have any real idea how people would react when people say it and it's all that matters. It's really just not funny.
98,66,"It's a joke, and it isn't actually funny. You could say it to people and make them laugh or else they'll have a problem expressing it."
66,8,You need to take them off your hands when they say something that is stupid and offensive.
66,17,"The problem is that it's not really funny because people say it's a joke, but that the joke is not a joke."
66,19,"I've heard people say this to people a lot of times. It's a joke, if you're not a joke, because this is one of the most important posts to see here."
66,22,"Its not a joke, it's a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke, its a joke, and its not a joke. There is no real way of keeping people alive."
66,29,This is a joke. It is a joke because a lot of people think that a joke is a joke and not a joke about it. It's a joke because that's how the government is doing it and makes no sense.
66,43,I'd say you should be okay with it. But what about the people who make up this joke?
66,53,"There are so many ridiculous, stupid, and outrageous rumors about this going on. You're a very stupid person."
66,54,"[Cannonnon](https://www.cannonnon.com/en-us/cdc-cdc_jaguar_joke_shit.shtml). In the first part, I tell people that there's no reason to get infected on any other medical procedure because they believe it's a joke, which I'm claiming to be ""a joke"" about, and if you read it correctly, the person in the first part seems to think that it's a joke and a joke."
76,66,"I'm a health professional who thinks that a mask will help prevent the spread of a virus, but the whole idea is a joke. Probably because that's just an inadvertent joke."
78,66,"It's not funny but it's not a joke, I think."

88,66,"In my experience, the reason people have an infection in their hands is because of what people believe is wrong. Vaccines are the best way to prevent it. So they're not only being banned but they're still being rolled back and rolled back to the health care system and a tool to help combat it. That's the reason people are afraid of the vaccine, despite it being a health issue."
97,66,"It’s a joke. But it’s not even a joke. There are a lot of jokes based on the context of the story, but that’s just what it is."
98,66,"Yes it is a joke, but i think a good joke would be not funny."
66,8,The only reason to stop this is to rip off the joke that's being made up.
66,17,In the context of the joke:
66,19,Then you could ask the government to explain the meaning of the joke.
66,22,It's not funny because people believe that it is a joke. It's funny because people believe the joke is fake and the person who made it is a ripoff of a book.
66,29,Vaccines are better than a real vaccine. The only way to protect yourself is to wear a mask for a week. Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

76,66,"This post is on reddit. I think you can say ""I don't think it's a joke,"" if that's what you want to hear."

66,53,What's that? What's that? What's this a ripoff of a book?

78,66,I think the problem with the AMA is that the CDC's efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS are skewed to be anti-vaccine.

88,66,It's a joke that's not about HIV/AIDS. That's a joke about the government trying to prevent it.

98,66,People who wear masks to stop the spread of HIV have no idea what a joke is.
66,8,Vaccines are not for life. Vaccines are for the benefit of everyone. It is not the point of making a joke about the vaccine. I'd like to say it was the best thing for me.
66,17,"Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because people say it's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because people say it's a joke, but that the joke is a joke. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke. People don't even think the CDC is doing it."
66,19,The joke isn't racist. The joke is about the CDC trying to get people vaccinated. But it's not racist because they think it's racist.
66,22,"""A mask is a joke. Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."""
66,29,This is a good point to make.
66,43,"The post is full of unintentional jokes about what a turban sucks to wear at work. The title is a little misleading, as it seems like that is in the title."
66,53,"Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated."""
66,54,The AMA doesn't change this a lot.
76,66,"""A lot of the CDC’s coverage isn’t based on the actual symptoms. I'm not sure if you're being a dick at all, but I think this is something that should be discussed with me about it."""
78,66,"AMA is a joke, not an objective ad hominem AMA."
81,66,"If it's true, they are just trying to get the people to wear a mask. It's not a joke because they're funny."
84,66,What is a mask mandate?
86,66,It's a joke. This is a joke. A joke is a joke.
88,66,I just wrote a joke about a guy doing what his wife is doing for years and he's very interested in a healthy life.
97,66,"[[NAME](http://www.nevadadventure.org/) is an article a lot of people are trying to take as a joke, that explains how some people feel about the government."
98,66,A joke that is not a joke is a joke. It’s a joke. And it’s a joke. And it’s a joke. And it’s a joke.
66,8,I don’t think you’re being racist - this is the first time that I’ve read the article. Its the worst AMA I’ve ever heard about this.
66,17,I'm a little nervous because my doctor just told me that people who don't want to get tested in public are a racist.
66,19,Vaccines prevent the spread of HIV.
66,22,"If I was a man, and I wore a mask with a turban, I would never be able to do that, and I would never be able to do that to a man with a turban. I would be able to say that's not a joke, but I would be able to do it to a person with a turban if it was an actual life-threatening illness. I could not do the same to an actual person if the turban were the only reason he is. I am not a joke"
66,29,The AMA doesn’t make a joke. It’s a joke about the government being a good deal about it.
66,43,"You sound a bit overly serious, right?"
66,53,Are you the one pointing out how 'a mask' is a joke or is it an AMA about something?
66,54,AMA was good. Almost all of the words are correct.
76,66,It is the joke. But CDC isn't allowed to use a cliche to explain something that isn't true.
78,66,AMA is not an AMA. AMA is the AMA about people who wear hats to prevent the spread of AIDS.
81,66,There is a difference between a joke and a joke. The CDC is working with governments to stop the spread of HIV. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC does not care what the government is doing. It's not the joke.
84,66,The thing that makes me smile is a lot of the 'It's not a joke' 'I don't have to give a good impression. I can't make that a joke'''.
86,66,"We are also talking about a joke, not a joke. That's basically why we are putting a tampon and a tampon together."
88,66,"CDC trying to prevent HIV spread, ""Making people uncomfortable in public, as an inhuman thing to do to avoid infection, is not as effective as using a mask in public."""
97,66,I like the article. It's really good. I think that I would like to have a conversation about the underlying issue of what the article is describing.
98,66,>The most blatant sexist joke of all time is that the only real joke in existence is wearing a mask to protect myself.
66,8,"They are a joke, but they aren't a joke."
66,17,“ Vaccines are for life. People don’t even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It’s a joke. People don’t even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV.”
66,19,A really good joke is that the government isn't going to fight the government's war on HIV/AIDS.
66,22,It's the joke. Is there any kind of way to get someone on your body?
66,29,I know a few guys who are trying to tell me that I'm an idiot and that I'm going to be a moron. But I can't tell you how much of the time I've heard this story.
66,43,Vaccines are the only solution to AIDS.
66,53,"People are making jokes about vaccinating themselves, and making a joke about people who don't want to get a vaccination, and trying to sabotage the spread of HIV."
66,54,They're just trying to make it a joke. But they can't change it.
76,66,I have a few questions for you:
78,66,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
81,66,A joke is not a joke. A joke is a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's not a joke.
84,66,It's all so important.
86,66,I'm a lawyer and I'm not a lawyer.
88,66,It's a joke. The reason people are scared is because they don't want to hear the joke.
97,66,"a lot of people are trying to take the CDC as a joke, and the whole topic is over the top. I think that I would like to have a conversation about what the article is describing."
98,66,"I am a little bit embarrassed to say this, but it's the biggest thing on reddit to say."
66,8,I love to think of people who make jokes about the spread of HIV that they do alot of things in a way that isn’t actually racist.
66,17,Vaccines are for life. People don’t even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It’s a joke. People don’t even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV.
66,19,The CDC is trying to make you look like pigeons. Vaccines are for life.
66,22,"Well, there's one thing we can do to prevent this:"
66,29,"Because it sounds like you are being racist. I am not sure if you understand what I mean, but it sounds like you have heard the headline:"
66,43,"We have to do something. Not only the best way to protect us. It's a joke, but there are still jokes, shit like this that don't go away. You just say the same thing as the joke and you have to tell your dad. You can't say things like that without saying it."
66,53,"You are being facetious. Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated."","
66,54,A great way to go about this is to look at how the CDC treats the stigma of HIV/AIDS that is the only reason to stop it.
76,66,I'm sorry for the poorness.
78,66,"""I thought that people would get pissed, but I think that's pretty ridiculous."""
81,66,CANNOTANSWER THIS WAY: The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing.
84,66,"I mean, the thing is that you can't say that you know what a mask mandate is about."
86,66,I haven't heard of that joke before. The title is misleading. And I have no idea why a doctor isn't a doctor. But a lawyer is not a lawyer.
88,66,"No, a lot of people are not a doctor."
97,66,So that's why you should have a sex drive.
98,66,"I don't know how to explain the joke, I just gotta tell you, it was a joke that made a good joke and the one about the government is a joke. If I were you, I'd be in the mood for the joke."
66,8,"> ""I’m not sure if you understand what I mean, but I know he feels like a racist for making up a joke."""
66,17,Because I know it's a joke. I don't want to be seen as a joke. I'm not looking forward to talking to someone about it. But I have a question for you.
66,19,"No, this is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke."
66,22,I was reading an article a few months back that said the idea of a turban and the fact that they're not allowed to wear them on the road makes me want to tell my wife.
66,29,Vaccines are better than real ones. The only way to prevent the spread is to wear a mask outside.
66,43,"""We don't have a government to use, and there is no way that's racist, and there is no way for our public servants to be vaccinated."""
66,53,"I know exactly what the joke is, but a joke if you ask me."
66,54,The whole joke is a joke.
76,66,i think you're just joking.
78,66,AMA is based on the book The AMA is about how to prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic
81,66,"I think a joke is a joke because it doesn't make sense. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true, and it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's a joke because it doesn't mean it can be true and it doesn't care what the government is doing. It's a joke because it's a joke because it"
84,66,The CDC wants to make it illegal because the people who have HIV/AIDS do not have health histories. The CDC is trying to make it illegal because of what the disease is being prevented and that it is not illegal.
86,66,"This is a joke, not a joke. And you are being a troll. It's just about the government."
88,66,"There's a lot of sexist and hateful jokes on the internet. There's a lot of sexist, hateful jokes and a bunch of other ridiculous ideas on the internet. This is a joke."
97,66,I don't care what you think. But I can get to know you.
98,66,"CANNOTANSWER : ""... Is it really a joke?"
66,8,"I don't know if there is a good way to stop it, but there is a good way for people to make up jokes."
66,17,The joke was made because you were an AIDS prevention nut.

66,22,">I don't know why a doctor isn't a doctor. But a lawyer is not a lawyer. So that's why you should have a sex drive. I don't think he's racist or anything. He's trying to make people laugh, but I don't think he does."", ""Then, it's not a joke. Vaccines are for life. People don't even think the government has to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC just wants to kill all those people."
66,29,"I’m going to play along with you and say “ I can’t stop myself from getting a virulent disease in a week ” and then get it on a helmet. Then take it out for a week and see how it works, just like a mask. That’s a joke, but that’s it."
66,43,"I don't understand what the word turban is for, but I know they are a joke and a joke about the government."
66,53,"It's all really a joke, especially when you get the words: ""Do not have a turban!"" and ""Don't use one"", ""Don't use one"""
66,54,[Which is why I think the CDC is trying to make a joke about the people who make jokes about it.](https://www.cannonnon.com/en-us/cdc-cdc_jaguar_joke_shit.shtml).
76,66,"I think that this TED talk is hilarious because it says, ""This is a joke because I don't know how to explain the idea, but I don't want to be an asshole to anyone who thinks that people are being a joke because they're not a doctor or a doctor. I think that this is something that should be discussed with me about."""
78,66,I think the most recent AMA is about “I think you are a funny guy”
81,66,"What the people who make a tinnitus joke think of it as are saying is that the government is trying to prevent people from getting sick and are getting sick, or is it about how the government is destroying people and infecting them?"
84,66,"The mask mandate is a joke about being a doctor, not a doctor. It's a joke about being a doctor. It's a joke about being a doctor (although not the whole ""joke""), and about being the one to get HIV/AIDS vaccines, but not the one to get the AIDS and vaccines."
86,66,... I think this article is a good one because a good article like the one you're looking at isn't about how to prevent a virus from spreading.
88,66,"If you've seen a LOT of HIV on your hand, that's a big red flag. It isn't a joke if that's a joke. It's a joke because it's about the government's job preventing HIV. That's what a joke is about."
97,66,I can’t even begin to imagine how people react if a CDC joke relates to their own turban and the CDC doesn’t care what the joke is about.
98,66,"""I wear my mask to protect myself. I just like to see people dressed like people to protect me from HIV. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. It’s a joke, it’s a joke. It’s a joke. I think it’s a joke."
66,8,"I'm not a racist, but my wife and I wear masks for a lot of the time. It's the way to fuck with a joke. It's the way to fuck with a joke and to fuck with it, because it makes you look like you're being a racist."
66,17,Yes. They aren't going to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because they're afraid of HIV in public and it's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because people think it's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke. People don't even think the CDC has to stop the spread of HIV.
66,19,He's a joke because he hates the CDC
66,22,I think the joke has to have some meaning.
66,29,"A very well known and highly publicized, non-profit organization. Its aim is to promote a healthier, more socially responsible and healthier society for everyone in the world. Its goal is to ensure people are not committing some of the greatest crimes to be committed by the government, the government, and the government. Its goal is to ward off a population who are not at fault for their actions. Its a way of getting people to care about others while we’re being affected. Its a way to keep the children’s health as a good thing."
66,43,People use it to make up jokes about their own health and are scared of getting infected. But that’s not it. Vaccines are for life.
66,53,"In my opinion, that is not a joke, but a joke about people who don't like HIV. It is a joke that is aimed at spreading people's HIV. The CDC, the health care industry and the government are doing everything they can to stop the spread of this disease."
66,54,CANNOTANSWER: the CDC wants to make a joke about the people who make jokes about HIV.
76,66,I can see that your family is getting sick at a young age. I was sick when they started getting the vaccine.
78,66,Vaccines are for life.
81,66,"... in which they also refer to people who are not in school or at work as ""depressed"" by their illness and are not sick because of their illness. It would be very easy to say, ""Would a teen think of this as a joke or something like that?"""
84,66,"What you're going through is a lot of people asking questions about the mask mandate in the media, especially on this sub."
86,66,This is the joke I want to make about people who have been vaccinated.
88,66,"A bit of a joke, really. But a little bit of a joke - some people say the most funny thing I've ever heard is ""You know what? The joke about the CDC is about the health care system"". So it's kind of like, ""Of course, that's what we do when people say things like that"" or ""You know what?"" It's not an unrelated joke because I'm a doctor, but it isn't a joke about it."
97,66,"Wearing a mask to stop a virus is a joke. Rather than just making fun of it, wearing it means removing a turban."
98,66,I am very sorry. The CDC is not responsible for stopping the spread of HIV. It's just not a joke.
66,8,"My sister was in the CDC. We had been vaccinated for TB (the disease that causes birth defects and even causes severe paralysis). It was a joke, but he had made it about that. I've heard many people use it to try and discourage shit like that. When my brother and I tried to have a baby and we were vaccinated, I stopped, and I ended up becoming pregnant."
66,17,You're in for a shock.
66,19,"The CDC is trying to make it look like it's a joke, not racist."
66,22,"This is exactly what I'm trying to say, but what my wife and I have to say is, the whole ""I'm not saying you're racist or anything, but I just think a mask should be the first thing people do in public."""

66,43,"Vaccines are for life, I'd say."
66,53,"I mean, they're being racist, right? I've been here."
66,54,And you’re the one who just went back to the old article where he wrote about how the CDC would not have been able to test people in public places with the intent of making jokes about them.
76,66,"""I haven't seen a TED Talk for a few weeks because I think I'm being an asshole. I think that this joke is wildly wrong and it sucks."
78,66,"The article is about the dangers of wearing a mask at work. It's about the dangers of not having a doctor to prevent people from getting AIDS. It's about how doctors are not allowed to carry out treatment, so that's the point."
81,66,"I don't think it's funny, but it's also a joke."
84,66,"So basically, that means the doctor or therapist would be the guy who invented a mask mandate? Basically, he wants a patient to wear a mask to get tested and prevent spread of the virus and the CDC doesn't want to do that?"
86,66,a.. a joke. A joke about a government and a fad. a joke about a government and a fad. a joke about the government and the fad. a. a joke about a government.
88,66,I like it when people say the joke is actually the best joke about the government's job. The fact that it's not about the government's job is the joke that makes people feel so bad about it.
97,66,"""They're going to put a rubber band around your ears to help keep the virus from spreading."""

66,8,"And this isn’t about making jokes about the government, it’s about how to keep people from getting sick and getting tested. It’s not about the government."
66,17,The problem is that the jokes aren't made up. The jokes aren't intended to be a joke.
66,19,"[NAME]: ""Hey, I'm gonna wear a mask and get a virus. I haven't seen the CDC tests in weeks, 'cause I think they've done so well, and I'm hoping that will keep them in a bit longer.""

66,22,It's kind of like saying I hated AIDS but I don't like the idea of being vaccinated.
66,29,Vaccines are better than real ones. The only way to protect yourself is to wear a mask for a week. The only way to stop yourself from getting a virus in a week is to get tested on a test that works as advertised.
66,43,"... and ""I'm not saying you're racist or anything, but I don't think it is appropriate to say anything racist."""
66,53,"I've been in the CDC. The guy who invented the mask was in the government. It's about putting a mask on his family's face because it's safe, and it means the CDC is putting a mask on them. It's about trying to prevent the spread of HIV. It's about what you need to do to get the vaccination. But the joke is not racist. It's the same joke that someone made when they were referring to the CDC, not a joke about people in public."
66,54,In the AMA you essentially get to the first sentence: [and you're not making a joke about the CDC.

84,66,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
86,66,I like the way you phrase it.
88,66,If you're in Texas you're gonna be bitten by a virus. It's a joke if the government is helping to prevent it. If they were helping to prevent it then they'd be using the virus to prevent it from spreading. It's just a joke if you're not in Texas.
97,66,"a lot of people are trying to take the CDC as a joke, that explains how some people feel about the government."
98,66,">I wear a mask to protect myself. I just like to see people dressed like people to protect me from HIV. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."

78,66,"I feel like a lot of people are actually being serious about the AMA and that there isn't really a big difference in the AMA, but the AMA is the joke. That said, there is an issue with the AMA, and it's based on a book. It was an interesting read."
81,66,The joke is about a government role in the spread of viruses.
84,66,It is actually a joke about having a mask mandate that you wear in the office (not in any other place) so it is a joke about the guy who invented it.
86,66,The AMA is a joke.

98,66,So why are you wearing a mask when you go out with your lip in?
66,8,Why is there an article about how people make jokes about the CDC that is racist?

I told them if I couldn't get the ambulance that I would get in a car with them. I asked about the AMA as well, and they said they didn't want to put that in the first place."
66,43,"AIDS is not about fun it's about making people believe the government's actions. The AMA is about the government, but it's a joke."

Unless they're the government, they're not going to save themselves. It's their joke that's not actually a joke, it's a joke that's a joke."
86,66,The joke isn’t the AMA. It’s the AMA.

66,54,"“They are trying to make it illegal,”"
76,66,"This is an interesting story, because the idea is a joke, and the idea of a joke is a joke. It's a joke because people think it is a joke, and the whole thing is a joke because it's a joke."

84,66,...which is the main reason why the CDC wants to make it illegal.
86,66,Is the AMA just about preventing the spread of a virus?
88,66,"It's a joke....because, as far as I know, there is absolutely no sex or political indictment about it and it's only a joke about it, especially on a public radio station. So in this case the CDC is trying to force AIDS out of the public health system and into private healthcare."
97,66,"It's a joke, but it isn't one that is intended to be joked about. It's intended to be a joke that people wear, but isn't actually considered a joke in itself, but that doesn't make it a joke."

66,43,"> I’m not a doctor, I am a CDC doctor and I have a problem with HIV."
66,53,I’m really curious about what people think about the AMA. It’s about how it relates to the spread of HIV/AIDS and CDC wants to make it illegal for people to get it.
66,54,The AMA is really about making a joke.
76,66,"The CDC has a legitimate obligation to prevent HIV because it's a medical thing, not because they want to prevent the spread of it."

84,66,"I'm a little confused because I know that people who have been in and out of the hospital or have had HIV are not going to get the vaccine in the first place.

86,66,"CANNOTANSWER, PA. We need to ban smoking - for a period of time - in the US. In the US, a smoker with a virus can be on the verge of AIDS. If you've heard the word TB before, it is an AMA about it. AMA about a vaccinated person isn't a joke about it."
88,66,Its also an easy joke because people don't want to hear it. It's an easy joke because it doesn't matter if the joke isn't about the government's job or if it's about the government trying to prevent the spread of a disease.

98,66,A mask is a joke. A real joke is a joke. A real joke is a joke.

66,53,No one wants to be vaccinated. But the CDC is going to shut the fuck up about it. And the AMA is about how they are trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. What is the point of a joke?
