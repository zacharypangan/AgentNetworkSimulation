70,54,as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports
72,54,my favorite thing to do when i see people not wearing a mask is cough as hard as i can right in front of them because the fear in their eyes is always so rewarding
73,54,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
74,54,this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask

98,54,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
54,1,Are you familiar with the concept of wearing a mask and keeping distance?
54,8,This is why everyone should wear a mask every day. It’s not a way to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a way to prevent it.
54,13,I am going to start putting my face on the table for a run at the same time.
54,15,I have two other friends who do this. I want to tell them it's because they don't wear a mask.
54,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,20,I'm so sick of this idea to keep my face out of my eyes. You need a mask. It's not a mask to keep your mouth in your mouth. You need a mask to be vaccinated and protect your eyes from any kind of disease. You need to wear a mask and keep your eyes off the road.
54,23,I am pretty sure the government has been working with the government to stop the spread of the disease.
54,24,> I love the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he wont enforce a statewide mask mandate
54,38,"It seems like this is about the same as ""what's the route in Orlando, Florida?"""

54,53,OP. I'm in Florida right now.
55,54,I'm surprised there's not any sort of antimicrobial in the U.S. as a result of the epidemic
66,54,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,54,That's interesting. You are a woman who needs to wear a mask.
72,54,I'm glad you got to know me.
73,54,"... And a statewide mask mandate would be the most important piece of legislation ever. It is a very valid and enforceable part of the legislation in the state of California, and the statewide mask mandate will be the most important part of it."

54,1,"I'm not familiar with the concept. I just don't want to go and get a mask. I don't want to go on my vacation in Florida to go run or anything like that. But, if you don't go to the movies with me, or have a picnic with me, I don't want to go on the road. I want to go out and have a good time, and then go home and get some fresh air before I go. I want to go to the movies so I don't have to wear a mask, and to keep the face off"
54,8,i can tell you it's not the right thing to do. It's just the right thing to do. i don't think it would work if i had to wear a mask on a work trip in a public place
54,13,I read that last paragraph because of what happened to my mom in FL.
54,15,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is why everyone should wear a mask every day. It’s not a way to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a way to prevent it.
54,17,I am also in florida so I am in the minority. What's the problem? I know many people that don't know anything about what they wear and the risks associated with them. I don't know if this is what the antimicrobial mandate is for.
54,20,> I'm a woman who needs to wear a mask.
54,23,Why are you telling this to me? There’s more to the story than just the person wearing the mask.
54,24,I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask
54,38,"I have a hard time believing in a woman's right to wear a mask on a job trip. If there is only one answer, why does she wear a mask, regardless of what she's wearing? If not, I would love to be with her if she was willing to wear a mask and keep distance. I would just be a little upset that she doesn't wear it to work. If she gets sick, then why do she wear a mask if she's already running?"
54,39,if you snort from a car i wouldnt even know the direction i would go there.
54,41,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,53,"I am also in Florida, and this is not what is on the article."
55,54,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they want them in their life and that they are aware of the risks and that they will take them on."
66,54,I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us.
70,54,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
72,54,"So, you're wearing a mask during the pandemic. You're not just wearing a mask, you're wearing a mask that's preventing the spread of the virus."
73,54,The state is bringing a new policy. I am not going to be the first person to say that.
74,54,It's very easy to say that you have an anxiety disorder or a colitis... but you're right that a mask is not effective in stopping that itch and not stopping it from being so bad that it can kill you!
77,54,"A liar with a mouthful that says that people can not go outside wearing a mask, and the government can't enforce its laws if they don't want to do so. It is not illegal, and isn't required."
78,54,I went on a work trip for the first time a few years back and I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus. I wore a mask and when I got sick I stayed in a pygmy pygmy park.
98,54,I like wearing a mask for a reason.
54,1,What do you think about the CDC?
54,8,I think what is the issue with it is that a woman can't wear a mask in the event of a flu. She can wear the same mask for any period of time.
54,13,"No, it's not the same as wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a mask. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination."
54,15,"It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."
54,17,"I've heard that this shit is very relevant to the topic. I've also heard it's useful to help people find the ""right"" way to fight the spread of a disease. It isn't in the OP's title, but it does add up to that."
54,20,"Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government. So, you're wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
54,23,There's more to the story than just the person wearing the mask.
54,24,"No, it's not. It's not even an excuse to not wear a mask."
54,38,I wore a mask when I was running and I had an illness.
54,39,I know this is a pretty common phrase but you have to be very careful of where you are interpreting it.
54,41,"'hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance ', 'I mean, I want you to remember to do that, if you have the time.' '"
54,53,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they will take them on."
55,54,"My dad wore a mask for a lot of fun he told me. It worked so well for him. I still don't think the government has to make money off of his mask, nor should I accredit my friends."
66,54,I am an idiot that can't figure out the facts of what we see on the internet.
70,54,This is a great way to show that you don't have to wear a mask in public. The CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat spread of the deadly virus at their airports. You should be familiar with what they're doing - but vaccinating children against the virus might not help. That's a good one. There are millions of us and it will cost millions to keep a mask on and prevent an outbreak and a relapse. That's a good one.
72,54,"I am going to take the words 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' from someone who is in the same room as you. 'Well, here I am, you're not getting the proper treatment because I'm afraid they're not going to stop the spread of the virus', right? Because that's exactly what I get. I am still surprised by his interpretation. 'Well, I am so sorry that he made you feel uncomfortable."
73,54,">They say that they want to see him without his mask. I know what you mean, but I'm a pedophile. They say that they want to see him without his mask."
74,54,I'm a colitis sufferer. This can be very painful for you. A little more like a flu.
77,54,The only way to help someone who is sick to go outside is to put up with the virus and not take a photo of them while they're in your office. If your mother's body can't see the fecal matter it doesn't matter if you're under a helmet.
78,54,"I'm really confused as to why the AMA wasn't relevant. This isn't about the AMA, it's about if you want to read that."
98,54,"As a member of the U.S. government who wore a mask at a young age, I would go over to the US and ask what you said. I haven't actually asked what you said yet."
54,1,"I didn't want to post here, so I went over to find out more about the CDC, but this guy was pretty funny. Definitely the best ad for the CDC, I think."
54,8,"That's a bad idea, I've been in the hospital and I'm still struggling to find a good one."
54,13,"I think your mom is a pedophile and isn't even sure if she is a pedophile, or if she's a pedophile. I'm pretty sure her mom is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her."
54,15,"If they didn't have a face shield in the beginning, they would not have a face mask. Is that an appropriate face mask? I've not worn a face mask in the past, or is this what they think is necessary?"
54,17,"I read an article in a magazine about how people like a helmet and are willing to keep it on. I found it interesting to read the article and I was like, Hey, are you sure? You're an idiot."
54,20,>They say that they want to see him without his mask.
54,23,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
54,24,"Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination. It's an illegal, and not required, thing that we do when we're not working."
54,38,He's right to wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading to a person who's infected. Isn't this part of a vaccination policy?
54,39,"I can't believe people have made this blatantly inappropriate observation. I have a friend who wore a mask to avoid spreading a virus. I was able to get that on a shirt and go back to work without a problem. He just had a mask and a shirt, and a helmet. It's not funny to me."
54,41,"My husband, for all the fun of it, wears the same mask as me whenever I go on the trail. He always says, ""I don't want to risk it, if it was to make you feel uncomfortable."""
54,53,I think that's just the definition of what a pedophile means. I think that is pretty much the definition of a pedophile.
55,54,"That's actually the point that my mom made me. I would shave and rub her face to stop sneezing, because that would make me a little uncomfortable."
66,54,"I'm the one who made up this, but it's not the ""I hate to say this but I'm sure the government is aware of the need to protect us."""
70,54,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,54,I can't believe that the CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. It's a joke.
73,54,The guy's mom is on my watch list for the last couple of years.
74,54,"What I meant was that if you have any fear of a virus, you should not be able to get a vaccinated."
77,54,You're on the wrong sub for the 'rights' of a politician? What's the point? This guy's got some BS and is not actually a conservative.
78,54,"... I think the question is, what if they didn't put a mask on for fear of spreading the virus?"
98,54,"I can tell you it's just a joke and it doesn't make sense to me. I am not saying that the people I know that wear masks are all jokes, but that the joke is not one of them."
54,1,"The CDC is in the news a couple of years ago. If someone has a virus, the CDC is not going to let it spread to them. The CDC is trying to do it to discourage those who have a virus."
54,8,[No](http://www.resources.gov/eddit/en/gifs.aspx?doc=Dylan_Little/so-as-Is-Self-In-the-Eye)
54,13,It isn't an appropriate use of the word as a joke. It's a way of saying something that's actually an important point of opinion.
54,15,People have to wear masks to prevent a virus. Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
54,17,"It's a joke. And no, I don't believe it."
54,20,Is a pedophile a pedophile?
54,23,The government is trying to force you to wear a mask.
54,24,I think you've reached the right place for some kind of humor.
54,38,Are you a man? I'm sure you're in the same boat here.
54,39,"In that case, no. What would that be like for a male who doesn't have the right to wear a mask?"
54,41,"I've been in the hospital and I'm still struggling to find a good one. I think your mom is a pedophile and isn't even sure if she is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her. If they didn't have a face shield in the beginning, they would not have a face mask. I'm pretty sure her mom is a pedophile, so they're using it to intimidate her. If they didn't have a face mask in the past, or is"
54,53,I think it's a good thing the government is doing something to make people feel uncomfortable. This was a big deal when I was in college a girl wanted to keep the virus from spread to her. So she wore a mask to protect herself.
55,54,Why are people saying that you need a mask to prevent illness?
66,54,It's funny how this guy is getting into an abusive relationship with an infectious disease expert.
70,54,"I would say it’s a good idea, but it's not likely that they will actually take the effort to prevent this by allowing people with no medical knowledge to travel to the airports if they can’t afford it."
72,54,The CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. It's a joke. I think this guy is doing the right thing. I'm a big fan of the joke.
73,54,This is the wrong place. The government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV in the US.
74,54,Vaccines are not what the government wants. Vaccines are not what the government wants.
77,54,So the point of the thread is not to make any jokes about what the word mask means to people with HIV (they're not wearing a mask to protect themselves) and not about the purpose of the word'mask'.
78,54,"Vaccines are for life. It's not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. Isn't this an ongoing subreddit where you can take care of your family? I know the concept of masks is funny, but what are they? I can't imagine a santa walking on the trail. I would prefer that."
98,54,"I would like to mention that this was the first time I got the feeling that someone like this is a part of the government. It's kind of a hoax but it's a good one. I like wearing them because I'm being a little silly or something, because I don't get the feeling that the government is just trying to stop a virus spread. They do it because it's funny and they try to make fun of it."

54,13,"Vaccination is an important part of the vaccination program that is being implemented in the US. It is not an appropriate use of the word as a joke. It is a joke, that's just what the government is doing."
54,15,"I'm a woman, but the way they say that's a joke, and you have to wear a mask is just hilarious, because we're doing it for fun."
54,17,"I am from florida and the title says, ""I want a good joke to help people find a good way to fight the spread of a virus."""
54,20,I can't believe that if I ever ever see a pedophile with a mask and a face mask I don't get a chance to say a word based on a phrase based on a mask.
54,23,"If a pedophile and someone else in a relationship is taking advantage of the use of the word mask, that is an insult."
54,24,So the people that use a mask are not infected - they're faking it.
54,38,It's the people who made a joke out of this.
54,39,You are being ridiculous. It's the kind of joke I think people do.
54,41,I'm a woman and am just here to tell you I can't wear a mask.
54,53,"There are a few things that you should know about the government, like what it is and how they are trying to control the spread of HIV."
55,54,">Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what you mean. I hate to say it but you're not being totally reasonable with the concept of a'medical mask'. Why do you think that the mask mandate is required to protect against HIV is necessary to prevent someone who doesn't have HIV in public to get a vaccine. I'm gonna take this on as part of a more serious problem I have:"
66,54,It's funny how the government is getting into an abusive relationship with an infectious disease expert.
70,54,"If you were a teenager and they say that a man wearing a mask isn't a joke, then they're just doing shit."
72,54,"I'm not an anti-virus fan but I can say that the whole ""Waring a Mask"" thing is an incredible amount of good advice."
73,54,"> The ""Made in Texas"" policy."
74,54,"It sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke."
77,54,"I'm not the only one who has heard that the NSA is making sweeping, infrequent, insidious, and misleading statements about the vaccine being a joke."
78,54,I don't think I understand the concept. It's a big joke.
98,54,I have a friend who's husband wears a mask all the time when we're out in public with his face in and nobody knows about it.
54,1,"This makes you think the government is making ridiculous accusations about using the term ""a mask"" to combat HIV in a joke."
54,8,I've been to Florida and we have a health and wellness program. I've come to Texas and have the idea of the same kind of system. Then we have the first step.
54,13,">Hey, I just got back from the hospital, I was very afraid that I'm going to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what you mean."
54,15,That's not how this happened.
54,17,"So if your job involves you wearing a mask, you can go to the hospital, have a go at school, go to a museum and take a selfie? Then why not. That's a really good idea."
54,20,"I was wondering if you were here to post something like ""Hey, I just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance."", ""Hey, I just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come with you even if just for a mile i d wear"
54,23,... a man who does not have HIV is infected with a mask and a face mask?
54,24,"I am more of a drug user. There's not much to be had, other than some of these sexist jokes. I was going to say: Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination.

55,54,> I think the mask mandate isn't the problem. It is the problem. It is the problem.
66,54,"In all seriousness, the fact that it's a joke is an insult."
70,54,The CDC has the right to deny anyone the opportunity to have a medical report on the government. It's basically the only reason they've been doing this for a long time.
72,54,It's so simple and simple that it makes it a lot easier to get around without it. The fact that you're uncomfortable is why you should keep a mask for fear of getting sick.
73,54,"I feel like it has to do with statewide mandates, not the federal ones. They are redistributing aid to the government."
74,54,"I have had the opportunity to speak to someone about something I didn't think was relevant, and this made me want to be embarrassed about it."

54,20,"I believe that the fact that the AMA is actually a joke is actually just the very beginning. It doesn’t necessarily mean that “the joke isn’t a joke, but it’s a joke” and that it’s actually a joke. “But they’re not trying to make fun of it.” I don’t want to even do it."
54,23,"You're being silly. No, I'm not a joke. I think it's a joke. Is it okay to joke? Neither is the point of the AMA."
54,24,"If a person 'gets a virus' or an HIV virus, they're going to need to get one - the virus is very common in all countries. If it's the public health system, then it's not going to be a big deal, because they don't want to be able to help. They're not willing to help."
54,38,"The article is very interesting. The AMA is an interesting one. I thought it was very interesting because it gave me a little insight into how people get AIDS, and I thought it would be fun to see some people get it."
54,39,"I've read the AMA. It's about how ""I think"" the government is manipulating people and infiltrating the medical community. Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help."
54,41,Isn't it the same thing when you take in an AMA? Because it seems to me it is something to be worried about.
54,53,"My wife has been running for several months. It's crazy. I think it's hilarious to see a lot of people who aren't Doctors smacking of a joke on the AMA. It's like saying a remark with the 'This' is a joke' when a joke has zero substance and isn't really that funny. This joke is a joke, a joke but not a joke. I'm not being sarcastic."
55,54,I'm going to see this video:
66,54,"...because people know that this isn’t a joke? Because, yeah."
70,54,"It is a joke. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."
72,54,"It's not really a joke to wear a mask, but it's a joke to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. I'm not a fan of that. I think you're a big fan of the joke."
73,54,"I feel like you should leave the article with the word ""I'm a liar."" and then move on with your story."
74,54,Vaccine Advocacy is about the government destroying and preventing people from being vaccinated in certain ways and preventing people from catching the virus. They are not just looking at people with virus infection as some kind of health issue. They are looking at people with a chronic 'hug problem'. The government is trying to make it sound like people with a virus are just being vaccinated in the first place.
77,54,"I think it’s weird that it has been so often downvoted that people want to complain about it a lot, but I’m surprised it doesn’t happen."
78,54,I would definitely be a little worried about someone who would be infected or if he were out there in the field.
98,54,A phobia and a joke is about something.
