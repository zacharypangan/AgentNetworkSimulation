86,53,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
98,53,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
53,2,I think the whole people thing is a good thing because if they do do it they will be doing it in a way that makes them feel less dirty.
53,9,"I'm a bit confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean?"
53,13,Vaccinations are a dangerous disease
53,14,"Hey guys, this guy is the new face of a scam"
53,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,27,I would suggest you try to wear a mask in public instead of walking out and being sprayed in public with the proper mask.
53,31,I am just scrubbing my hands and twitching to keep myself clean
53,33,"Vaccinating yourself against the Coronavirus is a bad idea, as you shave your face during a morning run."
54,53,OP. I'm in Florida right now.
56,53,"A statewide mask mandate, though very weak and very likely to become a permanent threat if adopted by states or counties would be the least of the problems."
61,53,"The first paragraph was written as an attempt to discourage people from wearing a mask while walking to work. I know they would say ""Hey man, I can't believe it's santa."""

75,53,They don't know. They're just not smart enough to care.
78,53,It seems the idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight. I think it is just a way to stop a virus from spreading.
86,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,53,I can see the difference. I just go with the face out on my face. I have a very long forehead.
53,2,This guy is wearing a mask.
53,9,I thought he had the virus.
53,13,Vaccinations are a dangerous disease
53,14,"There's a lot of stuff about the mask that would not be covered. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or is a crime, it just means that it is a way to prevent people from getting the disease. And that's the one thing they haven't gotten - they want their citizens to wear a mask, and they don't want their citizens to wear a mask, because their public image is so poor and unhappiness is a real threat."
53,26,"I mean, the first two paragraphs are good."
53,27,I'd like to get one and make sure to buy the new one so I don't get it too close to a new person who has a problem with a virus.
53,31,"The second paragraph is pretty obvious to me, but I'd definitely suggest that someone who has never had a shave and do it while on a job in a public place get it and go."
53,33,"I live in FL. I'm a little confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean? Vaccinations are a dangerous disease Hey guys, this guy is the new face of a scam."
54,53,"I am also in Florida, and this is not what is on the article."
56,53,I hate to be the one to say that...But I d really like to go to bed every morning!
61,53,You can only get one mask for every santa who is not wearing a mask.
63,53,The Government needs to address the issue and make sure that these people have the knowledge and tools necessary to handle the situation.
66,53,You've got an upvote.
75,53,Are you a pandemic pandemic victim?
78,53,I think you misunderstood the entire point of the AMA...
86,53,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,53,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
53,2,"You know the one that actually has the best picture of a person being infected. That's how it should be. You're not a pandemic victim here, you're a fucking virus."
53,9,>It seems the idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight. I think it is just a way to stop a virus from spreading. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

53,14,i've had my face shaved twice to stop the spread of my virus. my nose is still shaven from the time it was born
53,26,I'm gonna tell you something about the topic of the pandemic 'Second Amendment'.
53,27,Is that the one people are talking about?
53,31,"I live in Florida. I'm a little confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean? Vaccinations are a dangerous disease. There's a lot of stuff about the mask that would not be covered. It doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or is a crime, it just means that it is a way to prevent people from getting the virus. And that's the one thing they haven't gotten -"
53,33,So do I. If he isn't wearing a mask to fight the virus then why would he have to shave? I don't think he should ever have to wear a mask. I've heard it is considered dangerous in some of the states.
54,53,"In my experience people wear masks to show their mental capabilities (not their ability to be aware of danger, but their social skills and their ability to perform tasks in public) to show they're willing to take risks and that they will take them on."
56,53,And the masks are not going to be used for statewide health care.
61,53,You're so funny. It doesn't make you a bad person. This is a good one.
63,53,... the government needs to address the issue and make sure that these people have the knowledge and tools necessary to handle the situation.
66,53,I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any kind of vaccine until I'm 40 - I'm just looking forward to getting one - and in my future I'm going to want to make sure I'm not ill. I feel very bad that the vaccines weren't already available.
75,53,I think he's trying to imply that the government isn't trying to stop the spread of a pandemic. Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
78,53,"I don't think people should have a problem with a doctor that does this. I think everyone needs to see a doctor. If they don't see you or haven't seen you already, why are there people in the medical field and doctors that have to wear them? I don't get the point. There are people that wear a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
86,53,The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask. That's why people keep wearing a mask.
98,53,"> It's not a joke, it's a joke."
53,2,"I've seen people who have gotten the sarcasm, but they still have to wear them. The second amendment was a joke. I've never heard that one before."
53,9,"I think it's a good idea to start with a mask that's supposed to look like a band aid and let you have a go. I do see people wearing a mask, but I think there's something wrong with that."
53,13,I've had to wear a mask as part of my daily shave.
53,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
53,26,"I grew up in the states, so I didn't know if it was true. I don't want to be called a racist."
53,27,">I think you misunderstood the entire point of the AMA... Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."

53,33,"I don't get the joke, but I know what you mean. It's not the issue of ""the government needs to address the issue and make sure that these people have the knowledge and tools necessary to handle the situation. I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any kind of vaccine until I'm 40 - I'm just looking forward to getting one."""
54,53,I think that's just the definition of what a pedophile means. I think that is pretty much the definition of a pedophile.
56,53,"No, it is not the problem. If a doctor has a vaccine to help a sick person, he needs to see the doctor."
61,53,They don't want to have a good time. I've heard a lot of people like to think it's funny to be wearing a mask while walking out of a grocery store in florida. But I can tell you the majority of them feel bad wearing a mask.
63,53,The movie does not sound like a joke. It sounds like it's meant as a joke.
66,53,I don't think anyone really cares about their health. It doesn't seem like a good idea to go to an infectious disease expert to explain what a CDC test was like but I think it is quite reasonable to go to the doctor to make sure your kids get theirs.
75,53,What was that? There's a naysayer in there that is not a really good doctor despite how he has dealt with pandemics and it's a huge scam.
78,53,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
86,53,The problem is that people who are sick and they don't understand how people can safely wear a mask. That's why people keep wearing a mask.
98,53,What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke.
53,2,"It's a joke, and it's also a joke. I just realized that when you say something like that, people are not saying anything but they don't really care about your health. I mean, we can have a lot of people think it's funny, but this is the way it should be."
53,9,I don't think any medical or pharmaceutical companies are going to use it in the first place unless the person is being charged with an infectious disease.
53,13,"I'm not a liberal, but if I were in the US, I would think it was a joke."
53,14,"""It's not a joke, it's a joke."""
53,26,"I don't think you get the point. I've seen people who have gotten the sarcasm, but they still have to wear them."
53,27,That's a joke... And the reason I like a mask is to show that you are aware of danger and are willing to take risks in public.
53,31,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it's a good idea to start with a mask that's supposed to look like a band aid and let you have a go.

Hey guys, this guy is the new face of a scam."", ""So do I. If he isn't wearing a mask to fight the virus then why would he have to shave?"", ""I think everyone needs to see a doctor."
54,53,I think it's a good thing the government is doing something to make people feel uncomfortable. This was a big deal when I was in college a girl wanted to keep the virus from spread to her. So she wore a mask to protect herself.
56,53,The article outlines several things about the vaccination policy in the state.
61,53,"The article says ""Women are supposed to wear masks for Christmas, so they're going to want to be vaccinated for Christmas"". So I'd say that they're very appropriate if they aren't vaccinated. I guess the issue is not about the vaccination, but about the lack of vaccinations and the fact that he's trying to discourage a certain group of people from wearing masks at the grocery store."
63,53,CANNOTANSWER A WINDY?
66,53,"Vaccines have been the best idea of the last 5 years - and the only way to prevent it is to get one. If it fucks you up, you can’t have a valid vaccine and it has to stop vaccinating them."
75,53,Vaccines aren't needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
78,53,Wearing a mask doesn't prevent the spread of a virus.
86,53,"I have been to several health care systems and they offer masks for the whole day. They're the only thing that enables me to get out of a mask, and are designed so that I don't go to the hospital. You could take my TB vaccine if you're not wearing a mask (with a mask on)"
98,53,...i love wearing masks to protect myself. he makes jokes about it to get away with it.
53,2,"I was an antiseptic, and when I was in school I was blown away by the joke. I don't see any reason for him to have to wear them because they seem like a joke, and it would be pretty much a joke as long as he doesn't shave."
53,9,A person who thinks they have the virus has no right to wear a mask to protect himself. A person that thinks they have a right to wear a mask is a person who thinks he is a troll and is making a joke in order to get away with it.
53,13,I was in college and I saw a guy on a mask that I didn't even wear until the end.
53,14,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
53,26,"In a book where the topic is ""Second Amendment,"" and the author is describing what it means to be in a joke about the fact that wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus."
53,27,he is trying to discourage people from wearing masks for christmas
53,31,">Wearing a mask, but when they don't, they don't seem to notice the need for them."
53,33,"If someone is wearing a mask to a certain extent, they are a joke."
54,53,"There are a few things that you should know about the government, like what it is and how they are trying to control the spread of HIV."
56,53,"I know I've been sick, but I am a few months into life, and I have the feeling that the doctors are putting their hands on the sick, and you are right about that. The guy is saying he's being irresponsible, and he is lying, and he's really insecure about the way things are supposed to be done."
61,53,"My dad got vaccinated for the first time in our family a couple of years ago. It's very strange that it is used for so many different things. A little older man was even allowed to come in and pick it up on Christmas, but was not allowed to get it on Christmas or at all until recently. There were two people walking in, and I had to turn around and get a new one. I got a mask to go with it, but I never got vaccinated at all. I just ended up getting it on Halloween."
63,53,Can you believe it's about how people can stop spreading diseases by wearing the same mask that every other American does?
66,53,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,53,Is there a joke that was used in public?
78,53,"You are a little harsh. I am not a doctor, but I work in a hospital, and I would go to the doctor to see if anyone was interested in the situation. Vaccines are for life."
86,53,">I've been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind. It was only a temporary thing, just like any other sort of protective gear. It’s probably not for everyone, but it’s not something that’s in the realm of possibility in a lot of places. In my experience, being unvaccinated will actually save your life. You have to be in that position to get vaccinated as well, and you should get tested for it."
98,53,"There's a joke on here. If someone was a joke, the government would make fun of it and if it were the government, they would try to make fun of it."

53,9,The article discusses the issue of having a mask when you go into a TB hospital. You have to be in the position to get vaccinated.
53,13,"I am so sorry this has happened to you. I have no idea what you mean by ""fake"" as in ""skinny jokes"" in other posts."
53,14,"CANNOTANSWER: I've had my face shaved twice to stop the spread of my virus. My nose is still shaven from the time it was born"", ""It's not a joke, it's a joke."""

53,27,"I don't know if I'm just getting on your site but I've heard a little of this on social media. People like the way it is being used as a joke about HIV, but they need to see it and understand that the joke is about the government giving people a better choice of treatment and prevent the spread of the virus by not bringing it up, so they get to talk about it as a joke and it's not about getting the disease out. It's not just about the people making fun of it he does it because it's so easy to get"
53,31,">I'm a little confused, but does that mean he carries the virus? Does he wear a mask? Doesn't he have to keep his face clean? Vaccines are for life."
53,33,"Vaccination is a very dangerous thing. It's very much something that we have been working through that can only happen through public exposure, so I'd bet you don't want to hear it."
54,53,A big deal for a teenager is not to mention the NSA smacks of a joke in a joke.
56,53,">The first part of this isn't a joke, it's a legitimate idea."
61,53,"You say ""I read that if you are sick in a sick place, you need to stop coming in and tell the kids santa is wearing a mask."""
63,53,The message of the movie is so good that it's even a bit off for a second. It's really not a joke. I've also heard that the message of the movie is so good that it's even a bit off for a second.
66,53,I was trying to tell you this but I had been a bit harsh when I tried to convince myself to take care of myself.
75,53,"It's pretty funny. In a lot of cases, people wear masks, as in the health of the disease."
78,53,Is it the government? Is it the government? I don't think so.
86,53,"Vaccines aren't just for keeping people healthy and healthy. Vaccines are for preventing people from getting sick and being vaccinated isn't for everyone, just like getting vaccines aren't."
98,53,"I hated reading this, but I thought you were being a dick. I feel like this would have been far more interesting to read, because I didn't really enjoy it, but I was just confused."
53,2,"The article doesn't mention the use of the word ""jail"", it's just a term for a joke. Vaccination isn't just for keeping people healthy and healthy. Vaccines are for preventing people from getting sick and being vaccinated isn't."
53,9,I'm not the only one. I just don't understand how people can be so hostile and be able to be outraged that I can't stand the idea of wearing a mask.
53,13,"As far as I know, there is no reason for the NSA to make fun of the jokes that are made. I would like to point out that the jokes I made are the ones that were used because there are so many different people who will be able to keep themselves vaccinated, as long as they get vaccinated properly. It’s a pretty good one."
53,14,A guy is a dick. That is a joke. The joke isn't about the vaccines. It is about the masks. That's the joke.
53,26,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for helping people keep their health. They're not just for keeping people healthy.
53,27,"I'm really sorry to hear that. This has been posted a lot, but it didn't sound interesting."
53,31,I had to get a mask to stop my immune system from getting the TB virus.
53,33,"This is a really good joke, but I really hope you are not an idiot."
54,53,"I have nothing to say to the government, so I don't see anything inappropriate here. If it's a government issue, then what do they mean? 'What's the issue with your body, that is something to worry about?' If it's a health issue, it would be more of a joke than a joke."
56,53,"In Texas, people do NOT have to get vaccinated in order to get HIV. But there is something about it that makes them sick - they can not give you HIV or something like that."
61,53,"""We have been vaccinated with the flu a lot, but we just have to get my kids vaccinated."""
63,53,"I'm not a doctor, so I understand the point of the joke."
66,53,"A virus could go on and on and on and on and on. Vaccines have been the best idea of the last 5 years - and the only way to prevent it is to get one. If it fucks you up, you can’t have a valid vaccine and it has to stop vaccinate them."
75,53,If I were in an emergency situation I'd probably be able to handle the CDC. It's ridiculous he's wearing a mask. I'm a victim and I hate pandemics and he doesn't need a pandemic. I'd feel he needs to be in the emergency room because he's going to be in a pandemic.
78,53,Is the government an organization? Not a government
86,53,"Vaccines are not a gimmick, they are meant to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy. Vaccines are mostly to help people get healthy."
98,53,"I know, it's a joke and its not a joke. But people want to be so stupid it's worth a laugh."
53,2,Vaccines aren't just for keeping people healthy. Vaccines are for preventing people from getting sick and being vaccinated isn't.
53,9,"A lot of people think people should be in the medical industry. They're not allowed to get vaccinated, they need to do something sexy, sexy. It's not really funny, and that's one of the reasons they say people shouldn't get in a situation when they don't want to, but it's just ridiculous."
53,13,Vaccines are for keeping people healthy. They're for helping people keep themselves healthy.
53,14,The joke is about the masks.
53,26,"> The article doesn't mention the use of the word ""jail"", it's just a term for a joke."
53,27,"It's not like this guy is even trying to get a better choice of treatment. You can have an HIV vaccinate but that would not mean you had to get a TB vaccinate. That's not the point, but there is something about it that makes you sick."
53,31,I think you have a really good point. That’s probably the most offensive way to put it.
53,33,I am the person with the TB virus. I live in Florida. I live with my parents in the states. My mom was sick and I was too scared to be vaccinated against it. And when I was about 5 months old I had the flu. I would be too scared to have a cold. I could get TB but I couldn't vaccinate my baby as I'd never had a cold.
54,53,AMA was slammed as a joke by [Sarah Rich](http://www.resources.gov/eddit/en/gifs.aspx?doc=Dylan_Little/so-as-Is-Self-In-the-Eye) a Democrat.
56,53,">The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
61,53,Vaccination is a big deal in the country and I've seen many stories about people wearing them in the US and abroad that they never got vaccinated.
63,53,I can understand how the joke is. It seems like a joke that people are afraid of. The story of the movie is that it's not a joke. I don't think people are laughing at the idea that wearing a mask prevents people from spreading a virus. That's ridiculous.
66,53,"I'm going to say that my husband didn't want to get a vaccination, but is willing to compromise because of that."
75,53,"I'm so sorry, but I think you're wrong. The entire AMA is not about the health of the child, it's about the health of the government."
78,53,"I was on the same plane. This is one of those trips where people have to go into a clinic, not to tell you to nip your hands."
86,53,"In addition to this, there's the possibility that your medical system will not be able to prevent the spread of a virus that can be spread by the government (or the public) without your consent. And that's the reason your health care system is allowed to do it."

63,53,What a fucking crazy idea.
66,53,It’s the government’s job to give people a safe place to live. We do it.
75,53,You should be able to say that as well.
78,53,I love the movie The Man in the Hat. It's very funny.
86,53,"Yes, I think the AMA is a little confusing, it's basically asking if the CDC is a gimmick."
98,53,I think that the funny part is that it's kind of a joke.
53,2,"Yes, The AMA is confusing and the CDC has a lot to say about how we can help people get vaccinated. They should put a cap on a child to thwart the spread of HIV, and to take the kids to a doctor and be able to say ""We are not doing this in the way it should be."""
53,9,"There is a lot of overlap here, like in the movie The Man in the Hat. It's very funny. Yes, I think the AMA is a little confusing, it's basically asking if the CDC is a gimmick. I think that the funny part is that it's kind of a joke."
53,13,"""I love wearing a mask because I feel uncomfortable and I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin."""
53,14,"Then you don't have time to shave the shaved facial hair, and you don't have time to go into a doctor's office to get the vaccines?"
53,26,"There is a misunderstanding, but I'm glad that the AMA did not make anyone 'happy' about the first paragraph - it was kind of an accident."
53,27,I shaved my face and it came off as a little weird in the beginning.
53,31,I'm a doctor and I'm always wondering what people are going to say when they get to the point where they know what the joke is. I just don't know what they're talking about.
53,33,"There is no point in taking a look at the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" jokes unless you know what they're talking about."
54,53,"'I know the concept of masks is funny, but I think it's okay for anyone to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies? I would think the one that was a joke was wrong, and not funny at all, That was the entire point of the ad."
56,53,Why do you think it's funny? Because you didn't get a diagnosis and you're a real pedophile? You want to make a joke and not be fooled by your family.
61,53,"It is called ""the joke""."
63,53,"People have said ""I'm not a doctor, so I understand the point of the joke."""
66,53,You think you are being harsh and you're actually a joke?
75,53,"My brother and I were talking about the risk of AIDS and he didn't need the mask, so we went out to a party. Luckily they made the right decision not to wear it because it is a joke and that's what he was referring to. But now he is going to come out with a joke on his face that says, ""I'm a victim and I hate pandemics and he doesn't need a pandemic."" Especially since it sounds like his comment was a joke."
78,53,I'm sorry I didn't read the story and it makes me feel stupid.
86,53,I'd rather not follow the AMA than just tell people how to get the AMA.
98,53,I like wearing a mask for my phobias
53,2,"In the first paragraph of the story, he said he doesn't like wearing a mask because ""I don't think it's funny"" and that he's a doctor unless you don't care about his own health. I didn't read the headline until I got to the point where I thought it was a joke."
53,9,"This is an AMA, not a joke."
53,13,It's a joke. It's like saying you don't even want to use a shaved face. Is there anything you want to do with your face?
53,14,I don't think it's the ad that's telling you that people don't understand the joke.
53,26,I'm not sure what is the point of a mask.
53,27,The first person who replies is probably not a doctor. I am.
53,31,"I can't believe the time it takes to get a joke made into a joke. It's like a big deal. People don't really realize it and the actual jokes about how many people can be affected by a virus or something. It's not like you've got to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, or you've got to do nothing."
53,33,> I don't wear a mask in public
54,53,"I don't think that's how it would be for a doctor to send a patient to the hospital or a doctor to check up on people with HIV, as long as they don't do it in public or at work, in the event of a severe allergic reaction."
56,53,It's kind of sad and sad when someone gets fucked and then catches the pedophile.
61,53,"There is no question that this is a joke, it is a joke. I was just saying that it's a little creepy. It's really funny and the people in it seem to be bringing it up. It's a joke that's causing trouble for some people who don't get vaccinated. I was thinking about something that's very funny, but oh wait, y'know what?"
63,53,It’s overdue.
66,53,It's also a joke that people aren't comfortable in public and the CDC is trying to make it illegal to do that to those people.
75,53,AIDS is a threat. It's a joke. It's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic.
78,53,"The main problem with wearing a mask is that it looks silly and unprofessional. I mean, if they had no sense of humor (which is a terrible thing for you, I think it would be ok to wear one) I wouldn't want to have kids in that situation. I feel like there's an audience with all kinds of people in that situation because it makes them look like they're not smart enough to recognize the joke, but that's a huge issue, and even for the OP I still think it's a joke."
86,53,"My best friend is allergic to the CDC, and when she asked to take some pills to avoid the infection I said “You have to be in that position to get vaccinated as well, and you should get tested for it.” It’s really good to hear that this stuff is really a joke that’s on every medical device in the world."
98,53,"Yes, this is a joke and a joke is a joke."
53,2,I don't think you can be a doctor. But I can understand why someone might think that it's funny to tell the truth about how HIV is a threat in other ways.
53,9,I am really excited for this one. This post is the right one.
53,13,"So, you're trying to get people to do something about it? It's a joke."
53,14,"As someone who is allergic to HIV and knows it's a dangerous disease, I'm sorry to say the CDC is putting the mask on so many people."

53,27,"I think I've seen it in my own personal life, and I hardly know who is."
53,31,"I'm a doctor, so I don't have to be in a nutshell about the problem. My biggest problem with masks is the fact that they can't be used by everyone, and that they're not being a joke. The problem with wearing them is that it's more than just a joke that's causing trouble for the people in it. I think you need to be aware of that. You are also able to do what you're comfortable doing, and in a way that you're not in a position to be a joke"
53,33,I think you need to get off the meds and go to the doctor or a doctor who treats you.
54,53,I think there's an error here. That the government's a joke. This is the part of the article that is misleading.
56,53,"I'm actually a lawyer, so I understand a lot of people in the post."
61,53,"Yeah. A friend who isn't vaccinated is not allowed to get vaccines, because they don't want to be infected."
63,53,I was a huge fan of the cyborg movie and the movie is overdue.
66,53,Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated.
75,53,It's more than a joke. It's about reducing the number of people who aren't already dying from an epidemic.
78,53,"If you have an infectious disease, you need a vaccine and you are not the best friend to everyone in your life."
86,53,"I've heard that people are more likely to be allergic to weed than to get vaccinated, and that they'll be able to get the vaccine, but it's really bad for the community."
98,53,I feel the same way about the sexism of using masks.
53,2,"This is a bit off the mark. The CDC is trying to thwart the spread of a virus in ways that are 'not funny'. They can not help the disease. They can't help prevent it in other ways, even when you don't shave."
53,9,As an HIV patient I can confirm that this is true. Vaccines are a disease that makes me sick.
53,13,I can understand how you feel.
53,14,I don't think I'm comfortable doing the right things.
53,26,>the main problem with wearing a mask is that it looks silly and unprofessional.
53,27,I feel like the whole joke in the AMA is about how the CDC is making a joke out of people who don't have a job.
53,31,"I've noticed a lot of problems with wearing a mask, but I don't find it funny. It's funny that the FDA is getting a bunch of people to stop them from taking vaccines and putting a little on it to keep people from getting infected, but it's not funny."
53,33,Is there a joke about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus? I would be very worried.
54,53,The joke itself isn't even offensive. It's being funny.
56,53,I believe the 'hybrid vaccine' would be a very good idea if it were on the market in the states (which I believe are) and aimed at the people in the area.
61,53,It's a joke to encourage people to wear a mask. It's not racist to suggest this to a doctor.
63,53,"I think it's a little off, but it's the only part of this sub I've seen that has been posted on here."
66,53,That's what the comments say. It's not a joke because the comment is blaming some of the jokes.
75,53," 'The entire AMA is not about the health of the child, it's about the health of the government. ''There's a naysayer in there that is not a really good doctor despite how he has dealt with pandemics and it's a huge scam.''"
78,53,What the fuck. Is it the CIA or some other organisation that runs the government?
86,53,"[NAME] says he'd prefer to not follow the AMA than just tell people how to get it, which is really bad for the community."
98,53,"A joke is not a joke, it's a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
53,2,I've heard that there is a danger to HIV if you don't have a doctor.
53,9,"I like the joke that people wearing a mask are part of the government's ""war on pandemics"". I know it's sexist but this is a very interesting thread and a good way to be open to discussion about a different and different idea of vaccines."
53,13,"I'm very surprised that people in your section would be uncomfortable wearing a mask, because they're not in the medical field. I can only imagine that a mask makes me uncomfortable and uncomfortable, but it does help with the issue of infection, not the symptoms of HIV."
53,14,'We've heard that people are more likely to be allergic to weed than to get vaccinated'
53,26,"I don't think it's funny that someone is being criticized. If the AMA is about the health of the child, I think it's a joke. I think there is a joke that is really bad for the community."
53,27,The AMA is a joke about what the government is doing.
53,31,"In the context of the original joke, the joke says ""I don't often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) and it refers to the fact that wearing a mask is a way to stop the spread of a virus. If you have an infectious disease, you need a vaccine and you are not the best friend to everyone in your life."
53,33,"It seems like the CDC is being overly apologetic and the AMA is not actually serious about the virus, but rather has been trying to talk about the 'dead side' of the AIDS epidemic if he doesn't want to shave at night."
54,53,What kind of joke is it? Like what kind of pedophile is it. It's not about the CDC. It's about the government.
56,53,"I think this is a really good idea, the CDC is a bit naive and just clings to the idea of taking action. It's going to be a bit of a stretch that you can't even believe that. I don't think they've done anything to stop the spread of AIDS."
61,53,"Is there a medical term that identifies as a joke in a movie a joke? Because it's a joke, but I'm not sure it would fit in the movie."
63,53,The movie is ridiculous and a joke.
66,53,"Vaccines are not a joke, they just have a more positive side effect, i.e. it's safer and doesn't affect your health, while the CDC is trying to stop it."
75,53,"""The entire AMA is about the government being able to help combat a pandemic, but it has to do with pandemics. "" ""We need to help stop the spread of a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics. ''"
78,53,The movie is very funny. I'm sorry to say it's too long but it's very funny. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
86,53,"Yes, I understand what you're saying."
98,53,">Is it a joke that people don't like a mask for any reason? Is that a joke because I can't put on a mask? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,2,"You can be a doctor and help people get vaccinated but if you don't, they're in the wrong. You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what the sex of the sex is and what your family does, but that's why it is sexist to want to fight a pandemic."
53,9,"I've seen one of the posters, but no one is getting it. It is very fucked up and disgusting to see that the entire AMA is about the government being able to prevent the spread of HIV, a serious concern."
53,13,I don't know about the world but I'd think I know better now.
53,14,Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
53,26,"CANNOTANSWER) [[NAME] writes an AMA about how it's not a joke that people are uncomfortable wearing a mask. Is that a joke because I can't put on a mask? Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,27,You should see how it was described in the movie.
53,31,I want people to know that wearing a mask is a joke.
53,33,Vaccines are NOT needed in the US. But it's not necessary in the US. They are very dangerous. They are not needed in the US.

53,27,AMA was a great and insightful piece about how this is becoming a joke.
53,31,That's the whole reason why it's so easy for people to wear masks. There is no such thing as being a joke. I think people need to realize that masks are a good way to stop people from getting TB from the air.
53,33,"I can't believe that the CDC has such a huge cult following of rabid anti-abuse people – ie. I think it's time to stop giving them any chance at having any kind of vaccination, especially the ones that are supposedly ineffective against the virus."

56,53,"That's not a joke. I think it's funny. The CDC wants to make the issue a reality, and it's not."
61,53,It's a joke. People say it's a joke. They have no idea what the joke is and they're not willing to tell a joke like that. They are also willing to tell a joke about things that are wrong.
63,53,It's not a joke. It's an example of how the CDC is using the NSA as a gimmick to minimize the risks of the virus.
66,53,"I can't believe the amount of people who said things like that were so confused when they realized this was not real, while claiming to be the joke."
75,53,"I'm assuming the point was that a joke is about the government, not people preventing AIDS? I mean, the fact that he's wearing a mask is more than likely a joke, but a joke about the government causing the pandemic is a joke IMO. That being said, there are no ""jokes"" that are made about the government and not the government."

86,53,"I've never heard that one before, but I have heard some really interesting things."
98,53,"In the same way you're making fun of people who want to be sexist, but don't want to be sexist, why doesn't a CDC employee say something like ""At this point I'm sure you're being funny because I can't see why people don't like it if we put on a mask"" instead of ""We're making fun of people who want to be funny and it's not a joke."""

53,2,People are becoming aware that sexist and racist jokes and that the government is a dangerous and corrupt body. There is no reason that they would be able to stop the spread of this disease.
53,9,This is how AMAs work. The people that post these things are going to be more skeptical about what they are actually describing. They don't get asked anything sexist if they're putting things on their face.

A CDC poster who is a virologist and asked me why I didn't go to the doctor and see if I could find a CDC official AMA and I couldn't find a source for what she says. It has a lot to do with that. If I see it as a joke, and you want to listen to it, you should read it in some light."
53,13,"It's probably a joke, but not a joke. The first amendment is pretty tame. It's been a long time. Unless a CDC article was written by a CDC journalist. It's one of those cases where ""A lot of people who have been vaccinated with the flu are being manipulated into thinking that it's a joke."

53,33,>I think it's time to stop giving them any chance at having any kind of vaccine until I'm 40
54,53,It's about the truth of the matter. It isn't that funny.
56,53,I think that the problem lies within this. People who are not interested in the topic are liable to get sick. The government will try to get the problem dealt with.
61,53,"I don't think it's a joke, I think it's a joke. But a joke and a joke should be in a joke. If it is a joke then it's not a joke. The article is actually a joke. It's actually an actual joke. The joke isn't about vaccination, but about how it is being used to discourage people from getting vaccinated."
63,53,"I don't want to think this movie is a joke and I don't want people to realize the difference. I mean, if it's a joke 'because it makes people feel bad', then it's a joke because it makes people feel bad."
66,53,The point of a joke is a joke. 'I don't think anyone really cares about their health. It’s a joke because people don’t think that HIV is the only vaccine available.
75,53,I think the biggest part of the AMA was that he was going to put on a mask and the AMA was not about AIDS.
78,53,Why do you think wearing a mask is a joke?
86,53,"I grew up with a doctor who believed in vaccines. He said they were good, but because it's a joke he didn't get the benefit of the doubt. I would have told him it's a joke but it's about a government being a joke. I wouldn't have gotten it if he told me. He probably knew what it was about.

It's like saying a remark with the 'This' is a joke' when a joke has zero substance and isn't really that funny. This joke is a joke, a joke but not a joke. I'm not being sarcastic."

63,53,That is not a joke.
66,53,No one wants to be vaccinated. But the CDC is going to shut the fuck up about it. And the AMA is about how they are trying to stop people from spreading HIV/AIDS. What is the point of a joke?
75,53,It's a joke about a joke. People are making fun of them - they're not even about the government.
78,53,I don't have any knowledge of any of those statements. I want to know if they have any valid reasons to take people out of this situation.
