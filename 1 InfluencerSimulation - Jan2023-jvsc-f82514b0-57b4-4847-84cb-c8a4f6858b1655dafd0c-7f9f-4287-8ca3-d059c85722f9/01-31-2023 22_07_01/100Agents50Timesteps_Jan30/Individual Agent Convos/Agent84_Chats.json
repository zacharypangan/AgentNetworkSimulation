    "I'm not going to lie. I'm not saying that they are not legal, and they aren't required. But the federal government is trying to make vaccines illegal. Vaccines are not legal because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legal unless you are a physician. What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they are legal. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented.",

    "Yes, that joke is an excellent one.",
    "I don't understand why the word \"joke\" comes across as like \"Jack.\"",
    "I'm not a doctor and I don't think this joke is ridiculous. I mean, the FDA is one of the largest organizations in the world, but in most cases the FDA has some pretty bad laws about vaccines. The only ones I'm familiar with are public health organizations that actually require a license to prescribe vaccines. The CDC is not trying to make the federal government illegal.",

    "As an attorney representing the CDC, you might want to consider filing a complaint with the CDC requesting a license and getting it vaccinated with the law. Generally speaking, people who work with the FDA are required to provide the vaccination kit at the medical clinic, and will have to pay up to $5,000 for the vaccine kit and any medication needed.",
    "You are right. It is inappropriate to have a medical professional work in Texas. I\u2019m sorry to say, but a doctor working in Texas shouldn\u2019t be required to do that. And not like it is improper, but the doctors union is a bad organization, that can help a sick person live their own lives - they don\u2019t if they have any responsibility for their health. It\u2019s a joke to make, but it\u2019s a joke to make. Especially considering the cost of an HIV vaccine despite the potential to make a doctor\u2019s job, ",

    "I've got a lot of information to share, and I'm going to have to reread it to be sure, as well.",
    "Aside from the fact that a lot of people think they need a doctor to provide vaccination kits, it sounds like these jokes are being made with the understanding that the federal government is trying to make it illegal to make vaccines illegal.",

He has to follow the law for a month and the only thing he can do is take off his mask for the day and scrub his hands with it. He also has to show a lot of a doctor that the health care system is not allowed to prescribe vaccines. He also has to show a doctor that he is going to prescribe the vaccine to the general public and it isn't legal in Texas.",
    "I'm not a doctor. I just chuckle. I think the CDC's attempts to make the federal government illegal is just being hypocritical and absurd. Basically, the joke isn't just a joke. It's a joke if you ask me."
