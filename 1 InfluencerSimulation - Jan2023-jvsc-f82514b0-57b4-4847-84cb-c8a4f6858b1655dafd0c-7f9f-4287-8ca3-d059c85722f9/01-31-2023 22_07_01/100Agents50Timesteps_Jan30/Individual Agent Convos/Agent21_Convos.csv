93,21,I do see how you can get a bit of nutrition in there.
21,1,You know the virus has been spreading.
21,6,The government is actually trying to keep people afloat by using things they need for the benefit of the community. That's why people think they can't go anywhere without a mask on.

41,21,"No one can tell you that they don't want people to wear masks because they want a safety net for all who are at risk, but only if they are not prepared to work with a gun."
42,21,The last CDC study that looked at the health of Americans who don't wear masks is from 2005. The average person would wear a mask about 10 or less times in a week without any type of physical contact unless they had a serious medical condition.
47,21,People should know that wearing a mask doesn't mean someone who actually has a right to the freedom of speech they can give them to be free.

75,21,I'm in the minority of the majority of the population that got sick from a pandemic.
84,21,It doesn't make a lot of sense for people to affluent to get a vaccination.
90,21,You haven't seen the free country?
92,21,Because the government is trying to make vaccines illegal in a way that causes harm to other people. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it is implemented. That s how it works.

21,6,I don't think that is an adequate question to ask to a government official. I just think that you are misinterpreting what the definition of a health issue is. What does this mean?
21,7,You’re basically saying this is the best thing to do and the most'sad' thing to do.
21,8,I believe the question is why isn't there an article about a person who does not have a mask?
21,12,Why should I be told this?
21,19,I see why people are assuming a lot of it is a response to the question.
21,20,Isn't it a really simple question:

34,21,I'm trying to get the pigeon out of my head and say no. What's the message?
41,21,I'm in a bit of a panic because my mom is sick.
42,21,"I've never seen anyone wear a mask as a precaution against a virus. I've had my whole family wearing masks, because it is one of the most dangerous things a person can do, and I wouldn't wear them unless they had a serious medical condition."
47,21,"I’m just wondering about the racial and racial difference in Texas, though... I don’t have a big opinion, and if I'm going to have a good time going to the hospital, it might be better for me to wear a mask as a way to stay safe in the hospital, rather than being the cause of the outbreak or the cure itself."

93,21,"IANAL. But santa doesn't wear a mask in the middle of his run. The only people in the community who do it, and the people who do it. The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they're doing something like ""Mom""."
21,1,Vaccines do not contain a virus.
21,6,This is really a shame.
21,7,> I believe the question is why isn't there an article about a person who does not have a mask? Why should I be told this?
21,8,... and how are people gonna get sick when people wear masks?
21,12,Well...this shit gets real tidbits.
21,19,"I thought that if the government did something to stop the spread of AIDS, and did it as they did, then people could actually make a profit from it."
21,20,"We need a little help, we need help."
23,21,What does the law say about having a mask? The fact that you are not in the US shows a lot of potential danger here.
34,21,I'm not sure if the CDC would be able to change the rules to prevent the spread of the virus if the CDC changed the CDC's recommendations. I'd guess that the government would be more concerned with preventing it being spread than with it being an anti-virus measure.
41,21,"Honestly, I feel like this is probably the biggest part of the issue. I don't think you're supposed to be able to wear a mask when you're sick, but I do know that I will always be able to have a med to look at if I'm in danger."
42,21,In that case I'll add that I have no way of knowing that if I wear a mask I'm going to be very dangerous.
47,21,The fact that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
48,21,What makes this a joke? You are actually a sick little slut.

70,21,"What’s funny is that, a million people still wear a mask and that’s enough karma for the government to continue their efforts. They don’t even bother vaccinating their citizens as long as they don’t have to worry about it when they’re sick."
72,21,My brother has HIV and it has been a joke for over ten years. I've seen a good amount of shit in my life but he never actually had a chance to see it. If I were to die I'd be the first person to die.

90,21,I wear a mask to wear to the movies and run. My favorite part of my job. It is to not feel bad about not being able to walk around in public. I'm a big fan of a mask.
92,21,CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. I like that your message is part of the government's role as a protector of people and health. It's a good one but there is something going on with it.

21,7,It was a great response and one that made people laugh and move on.
21,8,"As the CDC's lead says, if a politician wears a mask, he will be in a very dangerous position to get a good shot at identifying with a virus."
21,12,"That would make me sick. I don't know what to say when you're a teenager. I know you get sick. I'm a kid, and I hate being sick. Besides, I'm a very old man. I'm also a child. I don't get it. I don't get it. I am too young for my own good."

50,21,They have a very specific rule about what's appropriate to wear on the spot and when to put it on. It's called a Mask mandate to be used to prevent the spread of a virus. So it isn't going to be a joke to the government.
58,21,The CDC needs to address this?
70,21,"The CDC has a LOT of information about how they want to combat the spread of the deadly virus, and a lot of people."
72,21,It is illegal in some parts of the country. They say it because you like wearing a mask and that's because you like it. You have to wear it for your face. It makes you feel like you're a part of something.
75,21,I think it's a joke because it's not in line with what a joke is.
84,21,"They're just saying that if you're an alcoholic, it should be considered part of their health plan."
90,21,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.

21,1,"It's interesting that the government is not so much concerned with preventing the spread of AIDS, as it is with preventing the spread of HIV. If you had a virus, you'd have to wear a mask for your face and have someone tell you to wear it on the spot. It's not a joke, but a joke."
21,6,Vaccines can't be dangerous if people are being abused. So they should be able to prevent those fucking infections.

21,8,"I'm just saying, but it's also relevant to the CDC's ""No More Vaccines."""
21,12,"My first instinct is to use a mask to stop the spread of a virus, which is inherently unsafe and a terrible thing to do. And that is just part of the problem. This is one of those issues that is unrelated to government policy. The problem is how you get your own CDC, which is a good one. This is why they aren't supporting this issue."
21,19,">If you're not really trying to make a joke, it's about trying to make a joke."
21,20,Wearing a mask will help prevent the spread of a virus.
23,21,The AIDS epidemic is very likely and the medical field needs to address that a lot more.
34,21,"I've worn a mask for a while, but since I've been out there I still wear a mask. I mean you're being facetious, because this seems like an extreme case of getting the wrong kind of medicine at a very different time. You're getting that way too fast. This guy is a dick, right?"
41,21,"I'm pretty sure I was talking to him before, but I am getting confused about it. He was a raging bitch."

47,21,"As a person who's lived in Texas and live in Florida, I think a few days ago, one of the first things I heard was that I didn't want to wear a mask because I was pregnant - if it isn't in the US, I won't be going there."
48,21,I've heard a fad that's completely untrue. Unless it's a conspiracy theory.

58,21,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.noaa.gov/noaa/noaa.html) Wearing a mask can help keep you from getting infected. The government has an endorsed policy that states it will help you if you are infected and if you are vaccinated, but your doctors have nothing to say.

70,21,"So... we're going to say a few things about this, but then again, I don't know what exactly they're saying. Vaccination is one of the biggest health insurance problems of recent years - a combination of medication and therapy - and it isn't one of the least serious types of medicine. It's just a tool for figuring out how to prevent things from happening in your country."

58,21,"I can't vouch for the fact that this article is ""funny."" The joke's sarcasm."
70,21,And Vaccination is one of the most useful types of medical treatment.
72,21,"The fact that you wear a mask during a pandemic is what I think is the most interesting thing in this whole ""Waring a Mask"" thing is that it's a joke. The joke is about the government making fun of it because it's trying to stop the spread of a virus."
75,21,The entire thing is a joke.
84,21,You don't get a mask mandate when the government is trying to make it illegal?
90,21,Essentially the CDC is not in the position to prevent the spread of viruses and is essentially using the government to stop the spread.
92,21,"It's a joke, I think. It's also the point of the joke, because in this case the ""public health""'s 'care is ''protection'''."
93,21,It's not a joke. It's a ripoff. It's a joke.
21,1,It's a prank. Vaccination is a joke. The only prank I've ever heard was on a Facebook group called 'Facebook and People's Hospital'. They were actually able to cover a large percentage of the problem with a mask.
21,6,You can't stop a joke by saying it's a joke. That's a joke. It's a ripoff.
21,7,"Vaccines aren't really that obnoxious, they're just dangerous and don't really do anything that will prevent or slow the spread. They're just a matter of privacy. The fact that you wear a mask in the middle of a pandemic is very offensive."
21,8,This is the kind of prank I would never get over. The person who did this is a fucking slut and he is still doing it. There are a lot of things going on that make him think about vaccines and things like that. And there are a lot of people who don't. This is where people are putting their masks on.
21,12,It sounds to me like the government is trying to protect us from the spread of a virus.
21,19,There's a lot of sarcasm in this article. It's not just a joke. The fact that you do this makes it even more funny than it really is.
21,20,Vaccination is a prank. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
23,21,"In our country, the CDC is an example of how they use the same'safety'method for getting the virus that protects against a pandemic. Vaccines are also a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug."
34,21,"He's got some pretty serious vaccine issues on him and it will be in his best interest to have him in that CDC. Apparently he can't be a pedophile and therefore isn't a good vaccine. He is a pedophile, he is a pedophile. And if he ever is exposed to the disease and gets into a sick spot, he is going to have a vaccinated vaccine in the near future. That's not the worst possible way of defending the idea as in the story of how"
41,21,There are lots of things that are part of the government's policy:
42,21,I'm going to be so smug.
47,21,"This is a nice topic to have on this sub. I am going to go get some facts about why people who wear a mask don't need one, but that is a pretty interesting topic, I think, and this is why it is an important social service."
48,21,"""I thought the mask was a joke about a virus."""
50,21,Weird. I never really wanted to learn about this.
58,21,Is this a problem with a medically available vaccine? I have a TB vaccine and I am not able to get vaccinated.
70,21,"I’ve been here a couple of years and I still wear a mask when I go to the hospital with the same symptoms, so I know how that goes."
72,21,"I think the problem is that I have a long history of putting on a mask in my car, as a passenger, and when I can do it, my body doesn't feel as good as I should be, and when I get sick or have a virus, I will wear it."
75,21,"I'm not sure if I'd find a joke to be funny. I know that the joke is funny because you've posted on this sub, and it doesn't seem like a joke at all."
84,21,"I'm not saying that it's good, but I think it's a joke, because it sounds like it's really a joke."
90,21,"I love to run in the sun while wearing a mask because I know how much it hurts, especially to my eyes when I am feeling it, but there is nothing that's better than a fap of a virus."
92,21,"What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they're illegal. In other words, the CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
93,21,"I'm going to start a new one, but it's not a rip off. It's not a joke. It's a ripoff."
21,1,Vaccines are a ripoff. Vaccines are a ripoff.
21,6,"Vaccines are a serious problem, and I would definitely call it a prank."
21,7,"I love a good mask because of the hurts it gives my skin. I always have a few of those in my face. The worst is when I run at least once a week to my dick and it hurts for so long. I love to run in the sun in the morning and even I think putting on a mask is a joke. I can understand why he would be worried about it if I did it because I know what to do. It's hard to say, I'm not a rip off."
21,8,"> ""The person who did this is a fucking slut and he is still doing it. There are a lot of things going on that make him think about vaccines and things like that. And there are a lot of people who don't. This is where people are putting their masks on."""
21,12,[Nobody on this subreddit is getting a chance to answer a question](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyaskscience/) about this:
21,19,"What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they're illegal. In other words, they want the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
21,20,"No, it is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
23,21,"They are not necessary in any way to make anyone safe, unless you are a doctor."
34,21,"I’m a medical professional. Then I figured I needed a mask, so I didn’t see this on my resume."
41,21,> I want to help someone? Why don't you just go to the doctor and get them vaccinated?
42,21,"- [NAME]: I've been in the military - no idea if I wear a mask for work, or for personal safety (although it sounds like it can get me infected with HIV)."
47,21,There is also a very important difference between a gimmick and a mask. The government is not helping to stop the spread of a virus.

58,21,">How would I do it? I'm a doctor. I'm getting vaccinated for a lot of different viruses that I never thought were on the market, not just vaccines."
70,21,"It's not funny because if you are a Democrat, you have to admit that you don't know anything about a vaccine."
72,21,"My guess is that if there's a virus that's not on the outside, that would be the issue."
75,21,"In a similar manner, a politician who was trying to make a joke about what they were attempting to do in their state can't say anything about the actual threat. If someone wore a mask during a AIDS pandemic, that would be a joke."
84,21,...I don't think the mask mandate is a bad thing. It is just a bad thing.
90,21,I'm a guy and I'm not a man. I hate it.

21,1,Is there some point in the article where the government is trying to help stop the spread of AIDS?
21,6,Is a mask not necessary to prevent this?

23,21,The problem with the US is it's mandate is that the people who get the CDC into it wear masks when they are unsure of how to get the virus.
34,21,I don't have a medical degree.

It's not illegal to put a santa in a mask to prevent it from spreading in most places. Vaccines are not illegal in most places."
50,21,"We've tried all sorts of things, including being able to keep a mask, but never got the health care."
58,21,"My apologies, I was reading this in a new language, and I have no idea why you would read that."
70,21,It seems that the CDC has not actually published the details of the guideline - which is why they want to protect people from the disease.
72,21,"The CDC wants to prevent and impede the spread of HIV in certain countries, especially in Africa, and they need to reevaluate this before it becomes a big issue. The US has already lost millions of people in the past. They are not doing anything for it."
75,21,"I grew up in the South, and I'd wear a mask because it was a joke."
84,21,"It's an arbitrary, ridiculous, and politically charged mandate. There are several parts of it in this book, including the word mask mandate. You'll get a great summary. I think there's a great deal of people who might see that it's a joke."

93,21,"I know the sarcasm that is going around, but you said santa's mom was going to wear the hat."
21,1,I think it's funny to think people would consider'mama a joke' to be a ripoff of a joke. It's the same thing as putting a santa in a mask. They should have a hoodie and a hat.

21,19,"They're saying the government will have a problem if they start allowing it to be used as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, but they won't. They've also been trying to get more people to wear masks because they've thought they'd be able to save lives and prevent it."
21,20,"I can't even remember the first word of the sentence. If a doctor isn't familiar with a doctor and you're wearing a mask, it's a joke. It doesn't seem to me that this is a joke, and it's not an arbitrary, ridiculous, and politically charged mandate."
23,21,They are not required to make people safe if they are unsure of how to get the virus. What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they are legal.

48,21,Vaccines aren't illegal in most places. And I'm sure this is the exact kind of stuff you would see in a joke.
50,21,CANNOTANSWER is an irrational prick and a whack asshole.
58,21,The article isn't about a virus. It's about a government intervention that uses the CDC as an instrument to stop spread of virus. This is a joke.
70,21,What the heck is the difference between a sarcastic and a real joke?
72,21,The jokes / stories that are made about people using masks for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus / jokes that you mentioned are just a bunch of the people that make it out to be funny.
75,21,Is there a reason the AMA is a joke? It is about the government being able to help fight AIDS.
84,21,Vaccines are illegal unless you are a doctor. Why wouldn't it be illegal if it were actually a government mandate?

50,21,"I'm really not sure if this is funny. My guess is they have something against the government to do. Basically, the government is just attempting to help the poor."
58,21,There's nothing funny about the CDC and a mask can stop the spread of a virus. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help.
70,21,"Vaccination is the one of the biggest health insurance problems of recent years and people i know are getting sick, not just people i know. It is still used to fight the disease because of it's effectiveness in preventing accidents. They aren't immune to it because they are going to be doing it."
72,21,A symptotic toy that you wear during a pandemic and that's your own health isn't a joke. Probably something the CDC wants to take to stop spreading.
75,21,"As a woman who has a severe rash and is wearing a mask in a pandemic, I'd be very upset that you said you would not wear a mask to a party. You could have said you're in the minority of the majority and reacted as if you didn't know what the joke was about."
84,21,"It sounds like the CDC has a vested interest in a vaccination that will help the health of a person. This is a very valid argument, especially since this is a matter of if it will affect you. But don't forget that the CDC has a vested interest in vaccinating people because they are trying to stop the spread of a virus."
90,21,"I've never heard of a CDC joke but I've heard something similar about it. When I do a run, I always feel like I'm going to be snubbed a bit or raped or something. I am so worried that the CDC is being able to prevent people from getting viruses."
92,21,"I'm a doctor in Texas, but it is also the only thing I can see that would be used as a joke. This is how the US's health care system operates. It isn't legally required by law, because you can't legally give someone a vaccine if it's already in your system. They aren't required by law because people are not authorized to get one."

The fact that a CDC official said it would be against the law because it's not illegal in Texas is a little disingenuous. The CDC also is trying to get people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."

21,8,A good story is one of the most powerful jokes ever made and I am really disappointed. Is it really worth watching?
21,12,"It's just an AMA. A AMA is about the government helping people who are sick, or people who don't want to get vaccinated."
21,19,"In this case, if the AMA is on a public bus, and it's going to include a lot of sarcasm, it's going to make it even more sarcastic, and in the context of the story, it's going to be more humorous."
21,20,"As a doctor myself, I can confirm that if I wear a mask, a joke doesn't always go well."
23,21,The CDC has an AMA and a few articles. I've heard that it's not a joke. I have a feeling that most people who get vaccinated have heard of a few people using them as a rip off.
34,21,Are you a doctor? The doctor is a troll who claims to not be a doctor. You can make a joke based on the person you said.
41,21,[The AMA is about government policy: The government is trying to cut down on the government's ability to prevent the spread of a virus.

48,21,"AMA is a joke about the government getting sick. I mean, you might say some jokes, but they're not just for people to hear. They're for people to jokingly say jokes about people, and they're just jokes about the government trying to stop a virus."
