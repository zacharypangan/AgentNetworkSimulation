    "It was said a few weeks ago that a statewide mask mandate would not be necessary because of the NSA's policy of preventing the spread of HIV. 'He cut education funding, 'I loved you' but I don't like you' but I thought \"I love you\" but I thought \"I love you so much.\"",
    "There is a real issue in the US in this, as a federal policy to ensure everyone wears a mask, if possible. It\u2019s not a problem for the CDC to put in a new mandate because the government is too busy talking about the health care govt omg.",
    "What I like is the guy who said it was really a prank about the CDC. They are trying to prevent the spread of HIV by making people wear a mask. I think it is the NSA, not the CDC. They want to help people if it is a prank, because it helps people avoid the government. This is one of the problems with the government - its not their job to save people.",
    "I'm confused. Does it not matter how many times the government has made it a priority for the government to make it mandatory for people to wear a mask, because it would reduce the impact of that choice? I'm not sure why they're calling it a prank.",
    "'This is a problem not an issue with the government.",
    "This is one of the many issues that is always discussed in the mainstream.",
    "The whole problem is not having a mask on and being in a position to make the government stop, and to do so without it. If the government doesn't implement it and prevents it from happening then why does the CDC need to make it mandatory to do so?",
    "The problem is not that it will do the job, but that it will help the people in the community.",
    "The problem is that people have no problem with having a mask.",
    "I'm not interested in politics.",
    "No, he's not trying to stop a virus. This is about what you see. He is trying to make you do that for your health. He's not trying to make the government stop. He's trying to cut Medicaid. The way he is saying that isn't that good and he's not helping you with the mask a lot. I don't see how that works if he isn't doing anything for it. I have a bad case of how stupid he is.",
    "So a pedophile is not a pedophile?",
    "I'm in Texas. But I can't read the AMA.",
    "If you want a mask you are obligated to.",
    "A lot of the problems are discussed in the mainstream.",
    "\"We're going to have a bad time. This is a problem not an issue with the government.",
    "It doesn't sound like the Obama administration has the authority to take away the mandate because it doesn't seem to have the ACA mandate in place. So the mask mandate is a good solution to prevent a virus.",
    "I'm not sure about the current situation with health care, but I would not want to hear the AMA. If you are being a bit ad hominem, then he needs to talk to your state's health care board. They will make the decision to make it a 'deal-breaker' for his community, which is also a problem unless he is the president.",
