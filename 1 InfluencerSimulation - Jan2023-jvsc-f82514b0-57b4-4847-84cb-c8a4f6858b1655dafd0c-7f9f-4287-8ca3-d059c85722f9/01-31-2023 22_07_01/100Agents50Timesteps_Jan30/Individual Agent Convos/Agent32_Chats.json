    "huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask",
    "The dissenting opinion here is that there is no official statement saying that a huge covid does not have a mask.",
    "It's a bit like the American holiday of 'indulging in the sick', but instead of removing it from the scene, you wear a mask and santa doesn't even get to wear it.",
    "So, there's the santa mask at Santa's house.",
    "It's not an endorsement, but just a joke.",
    "I feel like that part of the 'We need a mask' thing isn't a big deal. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. I think it's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. It's not overdue for the movie and it is very vague.",
    ">I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. My guess is that that part of the 'We need a mask' thing isn't a big deal. You can wear a mask as a santa costume, and as a santa costume for some reason, it does not sound appropriate. You could use a more appropriate description of a \"strange, creepy, creepy,",
    "You're just trying to be snide. It's a joke because it's the kind of thing you could do without it.",
    "The title was snide. The whole \u201cWe Need a Mask\u201d thing was a joke.",
    "I think we need to start thinking about the underlying causes of these things. Like the lack of a mask and how the morals of society in this movie, is one of the most important issues that we need to discuss.",
    "The \"We Need a Mask\" thing was a joke, which makes sense. The \"We need a mask\" thing isn't a joke. I think the \"We Need a Mask\" thing was actually a joke and is a little vague.",
    "This makes me a little skeptical. I've always wanted to see the movie \"We Need a Mask\" and it's a joke and that's just one example.",
    "A large part of our culture is very sceptical about the idea of wearing a mask, as well as people who might not be aware of it.",
    "It's not a joke and it doesn't sound right. It's just not a joke. And, the most important point of the story is that a cyborg costume isn't the only kind of costume that would be good for the person who's in that costume. And it's not like an actual Halloween costume would be. And, the fact that it was a joke makes it sound silly and it's useless and it doesn't sound right, is a ridiculous joke.",
    "That's a very interesting fact, because you're only reading a small part of the movie. It's not a joke. It's just not a joke.",
    "I think it's a joke that's not just a funny part of the film.",
    "I have never seen a movie with a very funny title in it.",
    "It doesn't sound like a joke to me. A lot of people would get upset about it, but that's a part of the story of the movie.",
    "What does the troll say about a movie that you just read? You can't help it. You can't do it.",
    "I would like to say something else. I think the movie is a bit overdue but there is no official statement that a huge covid does not have a mask.",
    "The joke is a joke. There is no official statement saying that it is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The whole 'We Need a Mask' thing isn't a big deal. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. I think it is a joke.",
    "I've seen a lot of these in the past. I'm not a big fan of the one I like, but I'm kinda sick of this joke.",
    "It's a petty joke. But that's why it's a joke.",
    "It's not a joke, it's a joke because people are being overly literal about it. They have to start recognizing it as a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke because it isn't a joke.",
    "We need a mask and there's a joke about it. Apparently that's a joke because of the way it's named.",
    "It's a joke because it's about a virus, because it's not a joke.",
    "As a clone clone, I find it hard to believe I haven't seen a joke about it.",
    "It's an awful joke.",
    "You need to stop being a troll.",
    "There's a video on YouTube.",
    "The entire \"We Need a Mask\" joke seems too silly for some people. Clearly the people with the mask are only interested in santa.",
    "It's not a joke. It's a joke because of the way it's named. It's a joke because people want to make fun of the fads the comics spoof.",
    "That's a joke. I am not going to say something about 'a lot of people would get upset about it.'",
    "As someone who has watched The Assassination of the Titans on HBO, I have no doubt it's a fun read.",
    "I think this is the wrong way to describe the hivemind. I mean it's not the one describing the hiveminds as the jokes, it's the one that makes sense because of a sexist title. If the title's just a joke, then yes.",
    "This is one of those'really funny' comments where they get downvoted.",
    "The joke is that the movie does not want to stop the spread of the virus, but rather to show how the clone can help people out. It's a joke because it's about how the clone can be used to help others. It's a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.",
    "I'm sorry I haven't commented on this since I just finished reading it. It seems so odd that it isn't the best movie I've seen today because the clone thing sounds a bit out of place. It was a joke and I don't think I've ever seen it, but I do think it is a joke to me.",
    "I've seen the movie and thought it was fun to read and not as a joke. And I was pleasantly surprised by how good it came out, but I'm not sure I've seen it a lot of times.",
    "It is an awful joke. And I feel like that is a joke because the whole \"We Need a Mask\" thing is a joke because \"the joke is about how the clone can be used to help people out. It's a joke because people are being overly literal about it.\"",
    "I think it's funny, because of the way it's named. But it also reminds me of how a lot of people will be able to suck a clone's nose off if they're cloned at Christmastime or on Halloween.",
    "I'm not saying it's bad but it does sound like it would be a petty joke. I think it's not a joke because it's a petty one, but it's just a joke because it doesn't make sense.",
    "I've read the subtitles of all of these movies. Some of them are ridiculously funny and I don't think it's funny, but others are not sexist or insulting. They seem to be describing something that's not a joke, but are just not funny. They seem to be portraying it as a joke because it's about the clone.",
    "Clearly the movie isn't funny enough to make you question whether or not it's a joke or not. The movie is just a joke. The clone is a joke because it's about the clone's effects on people and is about how the clone can be used to help people out.",
    "So shit like that can't be a joke? I don't think I'm gonna be the one to go see that movie.",
    "I like the movie. But I don't think that the fact that it's actually a joke makes it a joke. I'm gonna go see it anyways. I am gonna see it because it sounds so terrible and I'm not even gonna go to see it.",
    "I mean, the actual joke is about a clone. The joke is about how he gets the virus. It sounds like a joke because the clone has an effect on people, but it sounds like a joke because of the way the mask is named.",
    "It makes more sense to me if I don't like it more than if I just liked it. I think the idea of a joke that it would be a joke makes it less funny. I really think that the whole idea is kind of like a sexist joke and that is what it's about.",
    "It seems like the whole idea of a clone is a joke. A joke that actually is a joke, it\u2019s actually a joke that is a joke because it\u2019s about the clone\u2019s effects on people. It\u2019s not a joke because the clone\u2019s effects on people are really, really bad, and he\u2019s trying to hide them from people. A joke because he doesn\u2019t know what they mean. Is it something that\u2019s an excellent joke, and the joke that he\u2019s trying to make",
    ">This movie is a joke because I think it\u2019s about how the clone can be used to help people out. It\u2019s not a joke because it\u2019s about how the clone can be used to help people out. It\u2019s not a joke because he doesn\u2019t know what they mean. Is it something that\u2019s an excellent joke?",
    "The clone is a joke because it's a joke about a clone's effects on people. It's not a joke because it's about how the clone's effects on people is terrible, but it's a joke because it's funny, but it's not funny because it's funny."
