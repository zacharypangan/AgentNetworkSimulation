this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask

wholeheartedly agree in the last weeks i have had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask
took my first flight in months for a work trip everyone wore a mask everyone was respectful of other people reminds you not all people suck most but not all
as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
